    "content": "「股神」巴菲特（Warren Buffett）縱橫股海一生，儼然成為旗下投資公司波克夏海瑟威（Berkshire Hathaway）的代名詞，身兼執行長和董事長的他，舉手投足都是焦點，但年事已高難免令人好奇，誰能繼承這位傳奇投資人的衣缽，事實上巴菲特本人早已心有所屬，認為波克夏海瑟威能源公司董事長阿貝爾（Greg Abel）最合適。 事實上，巴菲特於2021年接受CNBC採訪時，就曾透露阿貝爾是自己欽點的法定接班人，儘管外界難免質疑，接班人是否能媲美這位傳奇投資人，但波克夏董事會也相信，阿貝爾是合適的人選。 根據《美聯社》報導，波克夏董事會成員奧爾森（Ron Olson）日前向投資人介紹阿貝爾，強調此人掌握巴菲特的所有指導原則，包括讓波克夏旗下企業在一定程度上能自主營運。 奧爾森認為，阿貝爾與巴菲特一樣對數字很敏銳，能快速、準確剖析企業的資產負債表，也是一名很好的傾聽者，可能不向巴菲特能擁有大批全球粉絲，但一樣能把波克夏經營的很好。 那麼阿貝爾是何方神聖？根據《Business Insider》撰文介紹，此人生於1962年 6月1日，取得加拿大亞伯達大學商學位，曾經作為註冊會計師加入地熱發電生產商CalEnergy，隨著CalEnergy於1999年收購中美能源（MidAmerican Energy），同年隨著波克夏收購中美能源，阿貝爾就此進入巴菲特的視野，憑藉優異的工作表現，目前任職波克夏海瑟威能源公司董事長，且在2018年透過波克夏海瑟威董事會獲得董事席位，被任命為波克夏海瑟威公司非保險業務的副董事長。

    "published_at": "2024-05-02T22:50:07Z",
    "content": "By Jonathan Stempel and Koh Gui Qing OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - A longtime Berkshire Hathaway director said Greg Abel, who is expected to succeed Warren Buffett as chief executive, may not get the same leeway from the conglomerate's board of directors to make acquisitions. Ronald Olson, a Berkshire director since 1997, said at an investing conference on Thursday that the board would not \"handcuff\" Abel from making acquisitions, in his expected role in allocating Berkshire's capital. But he also said Abel's recent handling of difficult litigation against the billionaire Haslam family over the acquisition of truck stop chain Pilot Travel Centers cemented confidence in his leadership. It was the first time Olson, a lawyer, said he worked closely with Abel. \"There [are] going to be changes in terms of the confidence level that we had in Warren,\" Olson said when asked if Abel would have the same latitude as Buffett to spend cash as he saw fit. \"I don't know how changes will evolve when somebody replaces Warren. Let's not get too anxious about it. He's going to be around for a while. But once that happens, there may well be changes.\" At Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday, Buffett and Abel are likely to get shareholder questions about the conglomerate's future after Abel takes over. Succession at Berkshire has long been on investors' minds as Buffett aged, working at least two decades past when most top executives retire. Those concerns grew after his longtime second-in-command Charlie Munger died in November at age 99. Berkshire acknowledged that Abel was Buffett's successor-in-waiting after Munger let slip at Berkshire's 2021 annual meeting when discussing Berkshire's decentralized, hands-off business model that \"Greg will keep the culture.\" Abel, 61, has since 2018 been a vice chairman overseeing Berkshire's non-insurance businesses including the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, his former home. After Buffett leaves, his son Howard Buffett is expected to become nonexecutive chairman, while others would handle common stock investments. The dispute with the Haslams, including Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, centered on how much Berkshire should pay for the 20% of Pilot it didn't already own. In competing lawsuits, each side accused the other of manipulating Pilot's accounting in bad faith, with the Haslams saying Berkshire was undervaluing its stake, and Berkshire concerned it might overpay. Tensions had been rising earlier, after Berkshire took an 80% stake and replaced top Pilot management. Buffett tasked Abel to sort out the issue, and Olson said \"it was not pleasant going through the litigation.\" But both sides settled in January, and Berkshire paid $2.6 billion for the final 20% of Pilot. \"That was a problem that Warren put in Greg's lap,\" Olson said. \"His preparation and thinking was impressive. He is strategic in his thinking, and he is decisive in his judgment.\"\\ Berkshire also owns several insurers including Geico, the BNSF railroad, a slew of industrial and retail businesses, and hundreds of billions of dollars of stocks including Apple and Bank of America.

    "content": "MarketWatch reporter Venessa Wong explains how inflation jeopardizes the middle class. Plus, colleague Eleanor Laise breaks down the worrisome aspects of taking ketamine for depression without guidance. This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated. Jeremy Owens: Hello and welcome to On Watch by MarketWatch. I'm Jeremy Owens.\nA $100,000 salary no longer buys you a middle class lifestyle. That was the headline on a story last week from senior reporter Venessa Wong, and it sparked a lot of debate among MarketWatch readers. Today, Venessa comes on the show and explains why the inflation shock of recent years put the final stake in the middle class.\nThen we take a critical look at one of the hottest depression treatments in America. After the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry was partly blamed on ketamine, reporter Eleanor Laise dove into the world of ketamine therapy, which is quickly becoming a multi-billion dollar industry. She joins us to warn Americans about the dangers of at-home use of ketamine.\nPlus, we'll take a quick look at the news stories we're watching right now and how they will affect your wallet. First, let's talk about the middle class.\nThe inflation shock has left many middle income families unable to save what they need for the future or accomplish other financial goals that have long been considered anchors of the middle class lifestyle. MarketWatch senior personal finance reporter Venessa Wong reported on that last week and her story attracted more than a hundred comments and counting.\nBut rising inflation was only the final dagger in the back of the middle class. Venessa believes the high cost of three basic economic needs is what actually caused the dramatic effects of inflation, so I invited her on the show to break it down for us.\nWell, Venessa, your story last week sparked a lot of conversation and I wanted to bring that conversation to the podcast. And when I read your story, yeah, there's a lot of numbers in there, but I think there's one line that really brought it home for me and says exactly what you're trying to say here, and that was being middle income no longer affords a middle class quality of life in many parts of the US. Could you kind of explain that contention to me and how you came to that conclusion? Venessa Wong: Yeah, I mean this is such a personal topic for me and a lot of my peers. I think we've recognized that we are statistically doing well. Many of us are statistically falling somewhere in the middle of the income pay range in the US or in our markets, but still not feeling like it's easy or possible to get ahead. And it's a shocking realization that you may be doing okay or even slightly better than okay in many parts of the country right now, but still not be able to do more than cover your basic necessities. Jeremy Owens: And that's not what the middle class lifestyle has always been about. You need to be able to save for the future, you need to be able to enjoy yourself occasionally, but that's not what's happening right now from what you've seen. Venessa Wong: That's right. I mean, middle class typically conveys some sense of financial security and it also conveys some sense of being able to cover more than your needs, to cover some wants.\nThe Washington Post did a survey and that they identified six things that most people consider to be markers of a middle class quality of life, which are having a stable job, being able to save for the future, being able to afford a thousand dollar emergency without debt, being able to pay bills on time without worry, having health insurance and being able to retire comfortably. And doing all of those six things right now on a median income is very difficult. There are surveys that people who make low six figures, if you just kind of like eked past a hundred thousand dollars, it doesn't get you that far anymore.\nA lot of this is due to rising costs for housing, childcare, healthcare. These are big ticket items that eat up a lot of your monthly budget and don't leave very much for discretionary spending, for other necessary spending for that matter. There was a Zillow survey, for example, that showed that the typical family that's looking for a house right now would have to spend 66% of their income on their mortgage and childcare costs at the moment. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, and I want to really get into those three inputs you brought up there, housing, healthcare and childcare.\nNow, a lot of what we're discussing has come up since the big inflation shock of 2021, 2022. I mean, we're still dealing with inflation now. But those three inputs have been getting much more expensive for quite a while now. It was the inflation shock that, all of a sudden, really hit and people felt, but that inflation shock hit so hard to the middle class because the costs of housing, healthcare and childcare had come up so much over decades at that point. Venessa Wong: That's right. I mean, housing is very difficult right now if you're a renter or a buyer. If you're trying to buy a house right now, interest rates are very high. The costs of houses haven't really come down as interests has skyrocketed. Renters obviously continue to be sort of subject to the whims of their landlords, and it's also one of those things that becomes more difficult as you have children and your housing needs sort of expand. Jeremy Owens: And your childcare needs suddenly pop in. Venessa Wong: Correct. Jeremy Owens: When you're already paying a lot for childcare, healthcare, housing, all of a sudden, your grocery bill going up 20%, it's that much harder. And that's definitely what we've seen over the last couple of years.\nAnd just to give some numbers to it, the median income in the US for 2022 is just under $115,000, while you showed some numbers that a family with two adults and two children in large US cities now must spend more than $117,000 annually simply to cover basic needs. Venessa Wong: That's right. And we've seen for many years now, Americans taking on debt to cover basic expenses. There's so many ways to do that. Credit cards, personal loans, people are funding their educations with student loans. Mortgages are really expensive. So I just think like that the shortfall in our incomes is being made up by this growing debt burden, which has become really a very hot political topic, too, because I think we've reached the point where we are recognizing that this is a problem and one that's not sustainable, and we already are starting to see delinquencies rise again.\nAnd this is also in a climate where a lot of costs have continued to rise as well. One of the delinquencies that's up again now are auto delinquencies. The cost of cars have risen spectacularly over the past few years, and we're seeing that the average monthly auto payment is about $700 a month now, which is a lot more than it was before the pandemic. Auto insurance is up as well.\nSo just like the cost to do basic things in America, this isn't anything excessive. It's like where do I live, how do I get to work, how do I buy my food, how do I pay for medical bills have I become very big questions that are insurmountable for a lot of families. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, when I saw that figure, that 117.5K needed for a family of four to live in a large metro area, it actually seemed low to me, living in the San Francisco Bay Area where everything is so expensive, especially housing. Venessa Wong: It is, and it doesn't account for anything that you need for savings. It doesn't count for any unexpected expenses and it doesn't even account, for once, if you want to have a hobby or if you want your children to have a hobby, if you want to do anything besides sort of like daily survival, this estimate doesn't build in any costs for that.\nBut obviously millions of Americans are getting buy on about this much or less in many cases. And what's going on is that they are often compromising things that they need or compromising on things that they want or compromising on saving for the future in order to make all of it work. Jeremy Owens: Well, it would be good to see wages gain along with inflation. We actually have seen wages gain after a long period of stagnation in the last few years. But a lot of those wage gains have been to hourly workers on the lower rung of the salary scale, so that really hasn't helped the middle class that much. Venessa Wong: I think what we're seeing now, though, is that like getting beyond low income into middle income results, obviously, in some quality of life improvement, but not exactly what you would expect, right? And once you're part of this sort of like middle income band, you're still sort of facing a sense of financial precarity that is shocking for the amount of money that you're making.\nThere was a recent survey in which 48% of respondents who earn more than a hundred thousand dollars said they were living paycheck to paycheck, and that includes about a third of those who earn more than $200,000. But when you think about the cost of living in a lot of metro areas, this actually isn't that shocking. I think that people are still expecting that this money will buy them more lifestyle than they're actually getting, and it's because the costs just keep on escalating. And this is something that the Biden administration has talked about a lot in terms of corporate greed and greedflation. Jeremy Owens: Oh, yeah, Venessa, and greedflation is kind of my area because when we talk greedflation, what we're saying is that companies are using inflation to pad their profits. And I've done a lot of deep dives into the profit margins of the S&P 500 over the last three years, especially since we started seeing inflation in '21. Early on, we saw those margins expand for grocery companies and for fast food. And while those companies have upped their wages for the lower rung of the salary band in the past couple of years, they've seen those margins kind of contract again.\nWhere the margins are really fat right now is big tech and they laid off a lot of workers last year and, suddenly, the profits got huge. And the real danger now is that big tech is going to every other sector and telling them, \"Hey, guys, you know you can lay off some middle-income workers to help your profits up.\" And I know there are software salesmen right now in C Suites telling people, \"Hey, you can lay off six figure workers and just hire a couple of $50,000-a-year college grads and buy this AI software and they can do the same job.\"\nAnd that's where we're going to see a lot of real fear and there should be real fear over the next few years for middle class workers. Venessa Wong: There's so many things that are working against the middle band of the workforce, whether it's a focus on corporate profits, whether it's a focus on tech to reduce costs, and I think that's the sense of, emotionally anyway, psychologically precarity that a lot of people are feeling, which was part of what being middle class once symbolized in this country was having a sense of stability, having a sense of stable employment, which enables you to do all of those things, save for the future and afford an emergency and retire one day. And all of those things are just slowly being eroded. Jeremy Owens: And I don't see anything that's going to change that coming up. I mean, I feel like this is something we're going to have to continue talking about because it is the thing that everybody's going to get frustrated about. If you do everything right in your 20s and early 30s and you get to that point in your career where you're making six figures and you feel like you should be actually enjoying yourself after working so hard to get there, well, it's not what it was supposed to be. It's not what it's been in the past. Venessa Wong: That's right. There's been a lot of emphasis recently on positive economic metrics and how real incomes are up. So even though there's been record inflation, incomes have sort of made up for that in some way and we should be back to our pre-pandemic vibe because of that.\nTo which I would say two things. Vibes weren't great before the pandemic. I think there were a lot of cost-of-living pressures for middle-income people before we faced a global health crisis. And also I think we should always be evaluating who is enjoying economic growth. Because if there's anything that we've come out of the pandemic knowing and trying to keep in mind is that those gains are not evenly distributed. And so even while we're seeing low-income workers come away from this recovery with bigger gains in wages, we also saw them suffer the greatest losses at the beginning of the pandemic.\nI personally think it's politically dangerous to ignore these qualitative points of feedback that might be obscured by macroeconomic data. Jeremy Owens: Venessa, I do really appreciate the conversation. I appreciate that your story sparked this conversation. If you have not read the story, please go do so. And if you want to talk more about this, please hit us up at On Watch at marketwatch.com. You can reach out to Venessa independently as well to give her your story.\nThanks so much for joining us, Venessa. Venessa Wong: Thank you so much for having me. Jeremy Owens: We're going to take a quick break. Coming up, ketamine therapy. Stay with us.\nWelcome back to On Watch by MarketWatch. Before the break, we talked with Venessa Wong about her article on the middle class. Now we welcome MarketWatch healthcare reporter, Eleanor Laise to talk about a very important investigative story she recently published.\nKetamine is a powerful tranquilizer that has also been used as a recreational drug, but in recent years it has turned into something much different, a treatment for depression. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has admitted using the drug, saying it is helpful for getting one out of a negative frame of mind.\nBut ketamine was also a factor in the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry. And when Eleanor dug in, she found many other troubling anecdotes about the drug's usage. So we asked her to join us this week and talk about the multi-billion dollar industry and how to avoid the worst parts of it.\nWell, Eleanor, I've always known ketamine as a very powerful tranquilizer and a sometimes party drug named Special K. But how did it become like a trendy depression treatment? Eleanor Laise: That's right. This can be a really confusing area for patients right now because, like you say, ketamine is many things all at once. It's an FDA-approved anesthetic, which has been around for more than 50 years. It's a controlled substance that can have hallucinogenic effects and, as such, it's a party drug. But it's also increasingly popular as a mental health treatment even though it has not been approved by the FDA for that purpose. Jeremy Owens: Right. There is one nasal spray that's been approved by the FDA, esketamine, which is marketed by Johnson & Johnson as a nasal spray called Spravato, and that's a ketamine-derived drug that was approved in 2019.\nBut ketamine itself has not been approved for psychiatric use and that's really what people need to know is that no regulator has said, \"Yes, ketamine is good for depression and people should be using it.\" Eleanor Laise: Right. No, the FDA has certainly not said that about ketamine itself.\nWhat happened really was in recent decades there was research studying lower doses of ketamine, the sub-anesthetic doses, not the level that might knock you out before a major surgery, finding that those sub-anesthetic doses looked promising as a potential mental health treatment. So doctors started prescribing it for this off-label use, even though ketamine has not actually been approved for treatment of any psychiatric disorders.\nKetamine therapy has become quite a big business. I mean, over the past decade it has grown from virtually nothing to, by some estimates, roughly 1200 to 1500 ketamine clinics nationwide. The ketamine clinic market is valued at about 3.4 billion. Some ketamine therapy providers will offer in-person only treatments. In many cases, that means you're getting the ketamine through an IV with in-person preparation and aftercare from a clinician. Jeremy Owens: And that lines up with what I've heard about psychedelic treatment just in general, right? This is something that you want to do with somebody in a controlled environment. Eleanor Laise: Right, but we also have many providers that are offering online ketamine therapy where it's done more remotely. And the pandemic really helped spur the growth of the online therapy providers because the regulations on telehealth prescribing of controlled substances were relaxed during the COVID lockdowns. Jeremy Owens: But it's the at-home where you found a lot of people who had really bad experiences through telehealth and at-home administration of this drug, right? Eleanor Laise: Yeah, I mean there are some overarching concerns about whether we really have enough data on ketamine to arrive at firm conclusions, but particular concerns are being raised about at-home therapy for a number of reasons.\nA number of the experts I spoke with and the FDA itself have expressed a lot of discomfort with at-home ketamine use, first of all, the lack of in-person monitoring. Ketamine can cause changes in your blood pressure and heart rate. It causes, of course, sedation and dissociation. Over time, ketamine misuse can cause bladder damage.\nAnd getting back to this question of dosage, when you get treatments in a clinic, often those are the IV ketamine infusions and the dosing there can be a little bit more straightforward. At-home therapy in many cases involves ketamine lozenges or troches that dissolve slowly in your mouth. And the FDA has said that there's variation in the dosages of these oral compounded ketamine products that are marketed by telehealth platforms, making it hard to predict what risks might be associated with those treatments. Jeremy Owens: I think the most depressing anecdote you have in your story is about somebody who was going through the at-home in that way with the dissolvable ketamine lozenge, and was supposed to spit out what was left. And the person in the at-home therapy told them to swallow it, and they ended up with toxicity in their blood from too much ketamine, right? Eleanor Laise: Right. That person arrived at the emergency room unresponsive and was found to have a concentration of ketamine in her blood that was double the level typically used for general anesthesia. So there's definitely the potential for mistakes to be made, either by the patient or the provider.\nActually, one survey last year found that more than half of people who had tried at-home ketamine therapy had either accidentally or intentionally taken more than the recommended dose. Of course, mistakes can happen anywhere, but if you're in a clinical setting, at least there are providers on hand to help you.\nOne concern I've heard from some in the industry is that some prospective patients seem to be sort of price-shopping for ketamine, looking for the cheapest product they can find, but experts say that's really not a good idea.\nThere are a lot of other points to consider if you're really looking at this as a potential mental health treatment. Is this a provider who's going to give you ketamine no matter what, or is there a screening process and a thorough medical and psychiatric evaluation, determine whether ketamine is actually an appropriate treatment for you? Is this a very transactional process or is there going to be some sort of ongoing relationship between you and the practitioner? Are they going to follow up with you and discuss any side effects you experienced and whether it makes sense to continue the treatment?\nA large professional group of ketamine practitioners that's coming up with some new guidelines on ketamine therapy says they're not going to be recommending online-only business models that don't include that sort of ongoing relationship. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, and you spoke with somebody who had developed an at-home ketamine therapy startup business, and he had actually gotten out of the business and was very concerned about where it was headed, right? Eleanor Laise: Right. So he co-founded a mental health company that offered at-home ketamine therapy a few years ago, but he grew very uncomfortable for a few different reasons.\nHe sensed pressure from prospective investors to sort of maximize the profitability of patients. He felt there was sort a push toward longer term ketamine therapy, sort of regardless of whether that was the best thing for the patient. And again, the price shopping that he saw among some of the patients seemed to him, like he said, sort of a race to the bottom. Jeremy Owens: So just to break this down and make it as simple as possible for people, ketamine has not been approved for use for depression and the at-home ketamine therapy business has some issues right now that could make it dangerous for those who take part in it. Eleanor Laise: Right, and that's a very sharp contrast with the rules that the FDA has established for Spravato. The FDA has said you cannot take Spravato at home. It has to be done in a healthcare setting. Patients have to stay for at least two hours after each dose to be monitored for any adverse effects. So it's two very different worlds that exist here. Jeremy Owens: Right, right. Exactly. And I think, well, there might be even three, Eleanor, because you've got the nasal spray and then you've got the IV treatment that is very similar where you need to be in the clinic. And I think that's the one that first sprung up and you saw ketamine clinics all over the place.\nAnd then the pandemic allowed this to be done through telehealth, sent to people's homes, even though it's not FDA-approved. Are those rules in place forever? Is there anything that could push back against the telehealth ketamine industry? Eleanor Laise: So those more flexible rules that existed during the pandemic are still in place for right now. Officially, they are supposed to expire at the end of this year, but there are signs that it's quite likely they could be with us in some form for the longer term. Jeremy Owens: And that's because they're very useful for other drugs. A lot of ill people who find it troublesome to go out of the house, their lives have been made easier because of these rules. But not for ketamine, just in general. Eleanor Laise: Right. Nobody wants to really cut off access for someone who really needs a treatment. So the DEA has already said it's committed to the expansion of telemedicine and it's working on some new rules around this so stay tuned. We'll definitely be watching how that plays out. Jeremy Owens: For sure. And if somebody is considering using ketamine to treat their depression, their PTSD, whatever they may be facing, what would your suggestion to them be? Eleanor Laise: You're likely going to confront this choice between in-person therapy in a clinic and at-home therapy, and you want to consider all these risks that we've discussed in terms of how ketamine can impact your blood pressure, your heart rate, all those factors.\nAnd I would weigh the FDA's warnings about the compounded oral ketamine products and the variation in dosage and the unpredictability of potential side effects there. Some doctors say the doses available from some of these online providers are alarmingly high, higher than what they themselves would offer a patient through an IV when they're monitoring them in-person in a clinic. But we want to acknowledge that affordability and accessibility are important issues. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, it could cost thousands of dollars per session, right? Nothing about ketamine is usually covered by healthcare because it is not FDA-approved. Maybe Spravato is the one thing that you could possibly see getting covered by some form of healthcare. Eleanor Laise: There's some spotty coverage even of ketamine therapy itself, but the odds are a lot of patients are going to be paying out of pocket. So you want to evaluate, of course, not just the price, but all the services that come with it, the group therapy, the education, the follow-up consultations. So I would weigh all of that. Jeremy Owens: This is a situation where you do not want to hunt for the best price. You want to make sure that you're being treated in the way that you need to be treated to get better. Eleanor Laise: Right. It may seem tempting, but I would really weigh all the other services that are going to wrap around that part of your mental health treatment. Jeremy Owens: Well, Eleanor, thank you so much for coming on here and bringing this important story to us. Please read Eleanor's story to get more and thank you so much, Eleanor. We'll have you on again. Eleanor Laise: Thank you. Jeremy Owens: Before we go, it's time for What We Are Watching, a look at the news you need to know for the rest of the week and beyond.\nStarbucks and McDonald's executives said this week that customers are beginning to scrutinize their discretionary purchases more closely this year. That could be troubling news for the economy, which has been supported in recent years by surprisingly strong consumer spending. With two of the most widespread US chains reporting a pullback in the first three months of the year, fears are growing about the effects of years-long inflation on Americans' wallets and spending habits.\nBerkshire Hathaway will hold its annual meeting on Saturday, an event that has become quite the party for Warren Buffett and his company. But this year's event may be more somber as it will be the first since the death of Buffett's longtime compatriot, Charlie Munger. Still, Buffett's annual letter outlining his thoughts on the current state of investing and the economy, which he has issued for nearly 60 years in a row now, will make news this weekend.\nThe Monthly Jobs Report will be released tomorrow. And if you couldn't tell from our discussion about wages and layoffs, it will be crucial to understanding the current state of the US economy. After the federal government reported recently that gross domestic product declined in the first quarter while inflation began growing again, there are concerns about stagflation floating around, which this report could dispute or bolster. We'll talk more about that next week.\nAnd that's it for this episode. Thanks to Venessa Wong and Eleanor Laise. You can subscribe to the show wherever you get your podcasts and please do. If you like what you heard, please leave us a rating or review. It really helps others discover the show. And let us know what you want to hear from us. You can reach us at On Watch at marketwatch.com.\nThe show is hosted by me, Jeremy Owens, and produced by Mette Lützhøft and Isaac Gaines, who also makes this episode. Melissa Haggerty is the executive producer. We'll be back next week with a new episode and, until then, we'll be watching.

    "title": "Campus calls to divest from Israel hinge on a tough question: Where’s the money exactly?",
    "description": "Pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University demanded the school drop any investments in companies doing business in Israel.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-02T21:24:58Z",
    "content": "Pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University yelled “disclose, divest, we will not stop” as they broke into Hamilton Hall earlier this week, demanding the school drop any investments in companies doing business in Israel. But shedding those stakes first requires identifying them, and even that step — disclosure — can get tricky fast, higher education finance experts say. Many large university endowments are murkily set up with thousands of individual funds that have their own rules on how they’re invested, few requirements to share their investments publicly, and third-party managers whose oversight of day-to-day trading can limit campus officials’ knowledge of their own schools’ portfolios. “I think a lot of people believe an endowment is a piggy bank, and it’s not,” said Bill Guerrero, chief financial officer at the University of Bridgeport, a private university in Connecticut. School endowments are typically composed of many smaller funds, each with their own purposes, said Scott Malpass, who served for over three decades as the chief investment officer at the University of Notre Dame, a private Catholic institution outside of South Bend, Indiana, with nearly 9,000 students. During his tenure, which concluded with his 2020 retirement, the market value of the school’s endowment pool — a collection of several thousand distinct funds — grew from over $450 million in 1988 to more than $13.8 billion by the end of fiscal year 2019. “The big endowments have tried to improve on that in the last 20 to 30 years,” Malpass said of investment transparency, suggesting there may be room in some cases to go further. The University of Bridgeport, with nearly $42 million in assets and fewer than 2,000 students, has individual fund agreements numbering in the hundreds, said Guerrero, in which donors can specify how they’d like their contributions invested. A given fund might, for example, be earmarked solely for environmentally friendly investments. What’s more, many of these agreed-upon rules of investment are confidential, Guerrero said: “It’s very, very restrictive.” Student demonstrators have seized on this opacity as part of their broader divestment push. “It has been impossible to get Columbia to fully disclose their entire investment portfolio despite efforts from not just student organizers, but concerned faculty,” the Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine said in an Instagram post last week. “They have refused transparency for far too long.” The university has rejected calls to divest from Israel and instead offered to “publish a process for students to access a list of Columbia’s direct investment holdings, and to increase the frequency of updates to that list of holdings.” But direct investments rarely reflect the full scope of an institution’s portfolio. Many resemble a series of matryoshka dolls, in which some component funds that may not directly hold certain Israeli stocks could still have indirect ties to the country, for instance through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that themselves may have exposure to Israel. What’s more, universities tend to be mum about which asset management firms they hire to handle their investments — both direct and indirect ones. The Knight Foundation reached out to 50 U.S. colleges with some of the largest endowments last year, asking them to share details about the share of their funds managed by firms with diverse leadership. Only 18 participated fully, and eight others opted to self-report more limited data. “Even as public-facing institutions, universities historically are not transparent about their financial affairs,” the researchers concluded. “There’s no incentive” for institutions to share more details about their investments, Malpass acknowledged. Many institutions worry that publicizing too much information could allow others to copy their investment strategies or scare away asset managers that prefer keeping their client lists private. By law, nonprofits like university endowments are required to report some information annually on the Internal Revenue Service’s Form 990. The document outlines the broad mix of assets (i.e., stocks versus bonds) that an endowment has invested in, but it doesn’t require granular detail on specific companies or industries those investments are focused on. Many school endowment officers also publish their own annual reports to help students, faculty, alumni and donors understand how money has flown in and out of their portfolios over a given year. But these reports are optional, leaving it mostly up to university administrators to decide how much additional information to publicize. Institutions with assets exceeding $100 million are also required to report holdings every three months through 13F filings, which are mandated by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. But those snapshots aren’t comprehensive; for example, Columbia University’s endowment reported $13.6 billion in assets in June of last year, but 13F filings detailed only $68 million of those holdings, which include stakes in various therapeutics companies as well as Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. With just 0.5% of the portfolio covered by 13F filings, the remaining 99.5% is outlined only in much broader strokes on the school’s Form 990. In a statement to NBC News, Columbia University spokesperson Robert Hornsby said “we don’t share direct holdings beyond what is filed publicly, and nor do we disclose investment manager information.” The complexity of endowment funds hasn’t stopped universities from making divestments in the past. Three years ago, several large schools agreed to reduce ties with the fossil fuel industry following students’ climate change protests. An investment policy guiding Columbia’s endowment now lists fossil fuels, thermal coal, private prison operators and tobacco as restricted industries. Malpass, who restricted some exposure to drillers and oil exploration companies during his time at Notre Dame, said divesting stock holdings “isn’t challenging at all.” Many could be sold in a day, he said, though private investments could take longer to exit. Some argue that even a widespread divestment push across American higher education, which seems unlikely, would have little impact on the war in Gaza. “Corporate decisions are going to make a much bigger statement than divestment from a university endowment ever would,” said Chris Marsicano, the director of the College Crisis Initiative at Davidson College, a small liberal arts school in North Carolina. Others have warned that selling shares of Israeli firms at a cheap price could benefit investors who support the country, noting that boycotts of goods tend to exert greater pressure than boycotts of stocks. There’s also the risk that pro-Palestinian divestment efforts could trigger an exodus of deep-pocketed university donors with countervailing sympathies. Even so, Marsicano noted that pro-Palestinian campus protests are getting the attention of the Israeli government, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denouncing them in an address last week. “Divestment is definitely the vehicle to keep the protests going,” he said, “rather than the financial implications of divestment.” This article was originally published on NBCNews.com Sign in to create a watchlist"

    "content": "For premium support please call: Pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University yelled “disclose, divest, we will not stop” as they broke into Hamilton Hall earlier this week, demanding the school drop any investments in companies doing business in Israel. But shedding those stakes first requires identifying them, and even that step — disclosure — can get tricky fast, higher education finance experts say. Many large university endowments are murkily set up with thousands of individual funds that have their own rules on how they’re invested, few requirements to share their investments publicly, and third-party managers whose oversight of day-to-day trading can limit campus officials’ knowledge of their own schools’ portfolios. “I think a lot of people believe an endowment is a piggy bank, and it’s not,” said Bill Guerrero, chief financial officer at the University of Bridgeport, a private university in Connecticut. School endowments are typically composed of many smaller funds, each with their own purposes, said Scott Malpass, who served for over three decades as the chief investment officer at the University of Notre Dame, a private Catholic institution outside of South Bend, Indiana, with nearly 9,000 students. During his tenure, which concluded with his 2020 retirement, the market value of the school’s endowment pool — a collection of several thousand distinct funds — grew from over $450 million in 1988 to more than $13.8 billion by the end of fiscal year 2019. “The big endowments have tried to improve on that in the last 20 to 30 years,” Malpass said of investment transparency, suggesting there may be room in some cases to go further. The University of Bridgeport, with nearly $42 million in assets and fewer than 2,000 students, has individual fund agreements numbering in the hundreds, said Guerrero, in which donors can specify how they’d like their contributions invested. A given fund might, for example, be earmarked solely for environmentally friendly investments. What’s more, many of these agreed-upon rules of investment are confidential, Guerrero said: “It’s very, very restrictive.” Student demonstrators have seized on this opacity as part of their broader divestment push. “It has been impossible to get Columbia to fully disclose their entire investment portfolio despite efforts from not just student organizers, but concerned faculty,” the Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine said in an Instagram post last week. “They have refused transparency for far too long.” The university has rejected calls to divest from Israel and instead offered to “publish a process for students to access a list of Columbia’s direct investment holdings, and to increase the frequency of updates to that list of holdings.” But direct investments rarely reflect the full scope of an institution’s portfolio. Many resemble a series of matryoshka dolls, in which some component funds that may not directly hold certain Israeli stocks could still have indirect ties to the country, for instance through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that themselves may have exposure to Israel. What’s more, universities tend to be mum about which asset management firms they hire to handle their investments — both direct and indirect ones. The Knight Foundation reached out to 50 U.S. colleges with some of the largest endowments last year, asking them to share details about the share of their funds managed by firms with diverse leadership. Only 18 participated fully, and eight others opted to self-report more limited data. “Even as public-facing institutions, universities historically are not transparent about their financial affairs,” the researchers concluded. “There’s no incentive” for institutions to share more details about their investments, Malpass acknowledged. Many institutions worry that publicizing too much information could allow others to copy their investment strategies or scare away asset managers that prefer keeping their client lists private. By law, nonprofits like university endowments are required to report some information annually on the Internal Revenue Service’s Form 990. The document outlines the broad mix of assets (i.e., stocks versus bonds) that an endowment has invested in, but it doesn’t require granular detail on specific companies or industries those investments are focused on. Many school endowment officers also publish their own annual reports to help students, faculty, alumni and donors understand how money has flown in and out of their portfolios over a given year. But these reports are optional, leaving it mostly up to university administrators to decide how much additional information to publicize. Institutions with assets exceeding $100 million are also required to report holdings every three months through 13F filings, which are mandated by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. But those snapshots aren’t comprehensive; for example, Columbia University’s endowment reported $13.6 billion in assets in June of last year, but 13F filings detailed only $68 million of those holdings, which include stakes in various therapeutics companies as well as Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. With just 0.5% of the portfolio covered by 13F filings, the remaining 99.5% is outlined only in much broader strokes on the school’s Form 990. In a statement to NBC News, Columbia University spokesperson Robert Hornsby said “we don’t share direct holdings beyond what is filed publicly, and nor do we disclose investment manager information.” The complexity of endowment funds hasn’t stopped universities from making divestments in the past. Three years ago, several large schools agreed to reduce ties with the fossil fuel industry following students’ climate change protests. An investment policy guiding Columbia’s endowment now lists fossil fuels, thermal coal, private prison operators and tobacco as restricted industries. Malpass, who restricted some exposure to drillers and oil exploration companies during his time at Notre Dame, said divesting stock holdings “isn’t challenging at all.” Many could be sold in a day, he said, though private investments could take longer to exit. Some argue that even a widespread divestment push across American higher education, which seems unlikely, would have little impact on the war in Gaza. “Corporate decisions are going to make a much bigger statement than divestment from a university endowment ever would,” said Chris Marsicano, the director of the College Crisis Initiative at Davidson College, a small liberal arts school in North Carolina. Others have warned that selling shares of Israeli firms at a cheap price could benefit investors who support the country, noting that boycotts of goods tend to exert greater pressure than boycotts of stocks. There’s also the risk that pro-Palestinian divestment efforts could trigger an exodus of deep-pocketed university donors with countervailing sympathies. Even so, Marsicano noted that pro-Palestinian campus protests are getting the attention of the Israeli government, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denouncing them in an address last week. “Divestment is definitely the vehicle to keep the protests going,” he said, “rather than the financial implications of divestment.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement"

Embora Buffett não estará sozinho no palco, é provável que os diálogos não sejam tão sarcásticos ou acalorados.

Mas, tradicionalmente, a maioria queria ouvir o que Buffett e Munger tinham a dizer sobre investimentos e o clima atual. “Charlie e eu somos sem vergonha”, escreveu Buffett em sua carta aos acionistas no ano passado. “Ano passado, em nossa primeira reunião de acionistas em três anos, recebemos vocês com nossa habitual agitação comercial. Logo do início, fomos diretamente à sua carteira. Em pouco tempo, nosso quiosque da See’s vendeu onze toneladas de nutritivos pés-de-moleque e chocolates. Em nosso discurso, mais parecido com uma fala de P.T. Barnum, prometemos longevidade. Afinal, além dos doces da See’s, o que mais poderia explicar o fato de Charlie e eu termos chegado aos 99 e 92 anos?Munger faleceu dias antes de completar 100 anos de idade. Ele e Buffett se conheceram quando ambos trabalhavam em uma mercearia do avô de Buffett enquanto ainda adolescentes, mas só vieram a perceber isso em 1959. Entretanto, foi só em 1978, quando Munger assumiu o cargo de vice-presidente da Berkshire Hathaway, que os dois começaram a fazer magia.“O projeto que ele me deu era simples: Esqueça o que você sabe sobre comprar negócios justos a preços maravilhosos; em vez disso, compre negócios maravilhosos a preços justos”, escreveu Buffett na carta aos acionistas da empresa em 2015.  “Mudar meu comportamento não é tarefa fácil (pergunte à minha família). Eu já havia alcançado sucesso razoável sem a contribuição de Charlie, então por que deveria dar ouvidos a um advogado que nunca passou um dia sequer na escola de administração (sendo que, bem, eu compareci a três). Mas Charlie nunca se cansou de repetir suas máximas sobre negócios e investimentos para mim, e sua lógica era irrefutável. Assim sendo, a Berkshire foi construída com base no modelo de Charlie.”Na carta aos acionistas de fevereiro, Buffett prestou homenagem ao seu sócio: “Charlie nunca quis crédito por seu papel como criador; em vez disso, deixou-me fazer as reverências e receber os elogios. De certa forma, seu relacionamento comigo era em parte um de irmão mais velho, em parte um de pai amoroso. …Embora eu esteja há muito tempo no comando da equipe de construção, Charlie deveria sempre receber o crédito de ser o arquiteto.” Continua depois da publicidade NYT: ©.2024 The New York Times Company \n                                        Henrique Esteter revela os bastidores da conferência da Berkshire Hathaway, o evento que transforma uma pacata cidade dos EUA na capital mundial do mercado financeiro                                     \n                                        \"Oráculo de Omaha\" enfatizou que futuro CEO da Berkshire não vai dividir responsabilidades sobre onde alocar os recursos                                    "

    "content": "Keeping Current Matters CEO David Childers and Jimmy Burgess discuss why a relevant market opinion based on facts, not fears, is key for educating consumers and navigating industry changes. Inman Connect  May is Commission and Compensation Month here at Inman. We’ll sort through the noise and misinformation and provide you with the most up-to-date facts and strategies about how to prosper in the wake of the commission settlements. And look for straight-to-your inbox updates with Inman’s new weekly digest, Commission Chronicles. Success begins with an understanding of what is happening and a belief that you can provide clients with the information they need to make the best decision possible for themselves. David Childers, CEO of Keeping Current Matters, is here to share action steps and talking points to recalibrate you to a mindset for success. Childers began by saying, “Mindset is probably the biggest battle agents are facing right now [with] everything that has come out from the [National Association of Realtors] settlement and the questions about how things will look when the anticipated changes go into effect. “This leads to the question, who are you listening to? Are you listening to the media, to the people who are fearful, or are you focusing on the facts? Because when you start to look at the facts, they tell a different story than what is often being told. Who you listen to sets the mindset you have and the actions you take, so be careful who you are listening to.” Childers shared that the first step in creating a mindset for success is to develop a relevant market opinion based on the facts. Childers said, “The questions will come. ‘Are prices going down? What do you think about mortgage rates? What do you think is going to happen over the next six months?'” You will answer these questions in one of two ways. The first is “I don’t know,” or “We will have to wait and see.” The second is, “Can I share with you a few things I’ve found, and what I believe will happen?” When you have this relevant market opinion based on facts, it is no longer your opinion versus their opinion. It’s their opinion versus the facts. He suggested agents utilize data to provide prospects with the best information possible. He broke the frequently asked questions into three categories, including pricing, number of transactions and interest rates. Childers said all agents should be aware of current pricing trends. “Although prices on the local level can vary from national averages, the seven forecasters we follow at Keeping Current Matters have an expectation this year for an average appreciation nationally of about 2.5 percent. But these forecasts range from flat to 5 percent appreciation. Agents need to understand both the national and local numbers when it comes to pricing. Forming an opinion based on the local pricing trends is critical to success for agents, but when a prospective buyer or seller turns on the TV at night, they are educated at the national level.  So here is what you want to say: “You may have heard this about home prices on the national level, but let me share with you what we are seeing at the local level as well.” At that point, share this slide on the national numbers along with your printed data on the local level.  The ability to show how steady price appreciation can build equity is another way agents can be educators and provide a professional perspective for buyers. This chart shows the estimated home price performance over the next five years from Fannie Mae’s Home Price Expectations Survey.  Although showing these percentages can be helpful, visually showing what those projections could mean in terms of home equity can be even more valuable. This next slide shows the potential growth in equity over the next five years based on the purchase of a $400,000 home in January 2024 and the price appreciation projected by the Home Price Expectations Survey.  An agent’s ability to have a relevant opinion on pricing that is based on facts is exactly what prospective buyers need in today’s environment,” Childers said. The next area we discussed was the number of home sales forecast for 2024. Childers said, “The forecasts range from an estimated 4.9 million homes to be sold in 2024 to 5.4 million homes to be sold as the chart shows. This year will be a year filled with transactions; the question is how much of the market share are you going to grab?”  When asked about mortgage rates and their effect on the number of transactions, Childers said, “The current market is a demand-based rate environment. We believe 6.5 percent is sort of the dividing line between limited to weak demand and good to strong demand.  Most consumers realize it’s extremely unlikely that we would see what we saw two years ago with 3 percent rates on 30-year mortgages, so there are a couple of things we look at to evaluate what the future holds.  We watch what economists are saying regarding the 10-year Treasury note rates and what the Fed is saying about the timing of anticipated cuts to the Fed Funds Rate. Based on what economists are saying, we anticipate a better rate environment in the second half of the year. Most of the projections show improvement with an expectation of rates being in the 6 percent range by the end of the year, probably in the 6.5 percent range.  Based on sharing this information with prospective buyers, they will often say, “Great, then we will just wait for the rates to come down.” But that is what everyone else is saying as well. This could lead to increased pricing and an increase in the competition to buy the homes that are for sale at that time.  “Based on this, it might be wise for buyers to buy that home now instead of waiting for an anticipated drop in rates and increased competition for a limited number of homes for sale.”  “In our world, everything has changed, and nothing has changed. Things have changed regarding the NAR settlement and things that impact the way we do our business. But nothing has changed relative to our need to be an educator. Nothing has changed relative to our need to be out in the market with a relevant market opinion based on facts. If anything, the value of being an educator has risen over the past several months and in the last year. So, our job is to be active in our local markets and to share the facts versus what someone’s opinion might be,” Childers said. “When a question comes up about the market our ability to share exactly what’s happening will be the difference maker. This is a time when people want to know: Do you know what is happening, and can you give them good advice? This takes the pressure off us as well because we don’t have to convince them to do anything. We simply provide them with the best information possible so they can make the best decision possible for themselves and their family.” Jimmy Burgess is the CEO for Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Beach Properties of Florida in Northwest Florida.

Inman Connect  May is Commission and Compensation Month here at Inman. We’ll sort through the noise and misinformation and provide you with the most up-to-date facts and strategies about how to prosper in the wake of the commission settlements. And look for straight-to-your inbox updates with Inman’s new weekly digest, Commission Chronicles. In a departure from most commission lawsuits filed in recent months by homesellers, a new class action lawsuit was filed on Monday in Florida against HomeServices of America by homebuyers who allege that HomeServices and other members of the National Association of Realtors fixed commissions, which misled buyers and resulted in buyers paying inflated home prices. A similar case known as Batton 1 was filed against the firm in Illinois in February by homebuyers, but HomeServices was dismissed from the case because none of the company’s constituents are Illinois-based and plaintiffs did not submit a claim that would assert nationwide authority in the case. The lawsuit filed on Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida names James Lutz as the plaintiff who bought a home in Key Colony, Florida, in 2021 using a buyer agent who is affiliated with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, one of HomeServices of America’s franchisees. The lawsuit is seeking class-action status that will include buyers nationwide who bought MLS-listed homes starting on December 1, 1996. “For decades, homebuyers across America have been unwittingly paying too much for, and receiving too little from, services offered to them by Defendants and other real estate agent members of National Association of Realtors (‘NAR’),” the complaint states. “Despite agent representations (which NAR permits and encourages) that such services do not cost homebuyers anything, homebuyers in fact pay a hefty cost for these services — namely, supracompetitive commissions at levels fixed by the Defendants, NAR; and other real estate brokers, which in turn lead to higher home prices paid by buyers.” The suit goes on to allege that the cost to consumers, as a result of the so-called fixed prices, was “enormous,” claiming that “experts have suggested that the amount of ‘annual broker fees consumers might save if there was effective price competition is as much as $30 billion or more annually.'” Chris Kelly (Credit: Ebby Halliday) Meanwhile, HomeServices has denied any wrongdoing or anticompetitive behavior and argued that the alleged damages contradicts those asserted in and accepted by the jury in the Burnett case, Real Estate News reported. “While we are just beginning to analyze this buyer antitrust case that was filed immediately on the heels of our settlement of the Burnett action, we maintain our position that HomeServices’ conduct and business practices were at all times lawful and procompetitive,” HomeServices of America Executive Vice President Chris Kelly told Real Estate News. “We also note that Plaintiffs’ theory of damages in this follow-on lawsuit is directly at odds with the damages theory accepted by the jury in the Burnett case and could potentially result in a duplicative recovery that would be unfair, unjust and violative of HomeServices’ rights,” Kelly added. NAR’s “Free Service Rule,” which in the past, had allowed buyers’ agents to represent their services as free of cost, and which the lawsuit also takes issue with, was eliminated in 2022. NAR’s policy change at that time stated, “MLS participants and subscribers must not represent their brokerage services to a client or customer are free or available at no cost to clients, unless the participant or subscriber will receive no financial compensation from any source for those services.” Email Lillian Dickerson Simply enter the email address you used to create your account and click \"Reset Password\".

The expansion observed in the historical period can be attributed to factors such as demographic changes, economic stability, increased risk perception among individuals, and product innovation in the insurance market.The market is expected to see further steady growth, reaching $11246.74 billion in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.7%. The anticipated growth in the forecast period can be attributed to global economic trends, concerns related to climate change, regulatory changes affecting the insurance landscape, emerging risks in various sectors, and infrastructure development. Key trends expected in the forecast period include the integration of sustainable and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations, growth in parametric insurance, applications of blockchain technology in the insurance industry, and the use of remote risk assessment tools.The anticipated increase in insurance penetration is poised to propel the growth of the life and non-life insurance market in the coming years. Insurance penetration denotes the extent of insurance coverage, representing the percentage of the population or businesses with insurance policies in relation to the total insurable market or population. This surge in insurance penetration holds significant advantages for both life and non-life insurance sectors, fostering heightened financial protection, risk mitigation, and overall market stability. These benefits accrue to individuals, businesses, and the broader economy. Notably, in 2021, according to data from the Insurance Information Institute, life insurance premiums in the US witnessed an 11.5% increase, reaching $159.5 billion. Additionally, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development reported an 11.2% rise in insurance penetration in Sweden in 2021. Consequently, the upward trend in insurance penetration is expected to drive growth in the life and non-life insurance market.The growth of the life and non-life insurance market is set to receive a boost from the increasing global population. The global population encompasses the total number of people inhabiting the Earth at a specific point in time, spanning individuals from all countries, regions, and continents. The expanding global population not only diversifies the market for insurance products but also presents insurers with opportunities to tailor offerings to meet the evolving needs of a dynamic and growing population. In July 2022, a report by the United Nations projected the global population to reach approximately 8.5 billion by 2030, with a further increase to 9.7 billion by 2050. Subsequently, a peak population of around 10.4 billion individuals is anticipated during the 2080s. Thus, the rising global population is a key driver behind the growth of the life and non-life insurance market.Technological advancements emerge as a prominent trend gaining traction in the life and non-life insurance market. Major companies operating in this market are actively developing new technological solutions to bolster their positions. For example, in March 2023, Sure Insurance LLC, a US-based digital insurance provider, introduced Retrace - an e-commerce solution. This innovative technology enables online retailers to seamlessly offer clients integrated one-click insurance and protection. Featuring a set of APIs (application programming interfaces), Retrace facilitates the integration of security and insurance for various use cases, including the groundbreaking Retrace Return Shipping Protection, which enhances the online purchasing experience for both consumers and retailers.Major companies in the life and non-life insurance market are at the forefront of developing innovative products, such as indexed variable universal life (Indexed VUL) insurance, to cater to larger customer bases, drive sales, and increase revenue. Indexed VUL insurance combines features from both variable universal life (VUL) insurance and indexed universal life (IUL) insurance.The report covers market characteristics, size and growth, segmentation, regional and country breakdowns, competitive landscape, market shares, trends and strategies for this market.

    "description": "The first Saturday of May marks two significant events: the Kentucky Derby and the annual meeting for Berkshire Hathaway.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-02T12:00:00Z",
    "content": "LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY - MAY 07:  Jockey Sonny Leon aboard Rich Strike celebrates after Rich Strike ... [+] won the 148th running at Churchill Downs on May 07, 2022 in Louisville, Kentucky. (Photo by Andy Lyons/Getty Images) The first Saturday of May marks two significant events: the Kentucky Derby and the annual meeting for Berkshire Hathaway. Despite their apparent differences, these events share striking similarities. Both attract massive, passionate crowds and are steeped in tradition. Moreover, they offer participants the potential to turn a profit, whether through winning bets or from successful investments. The age-old question for investors and horse racing enthusiasts alike is: do you pick the horse or the jockey? As Warren Buffett famously quipped, when a CEO with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with poor economics, the reputation of the business remains intact. The same applies to jockeys and horses. Legendary jockey Willie Shoemaker riding a show pony would never have won a race. Similarly, one of Buffett's all-time favorite CEOs, Tom Murphy, who ran Capital Cities/ABC (which later merged with Disney), would likely have struggled in a declining industry like buggy whips. However, when you combine a great CEO with a good business or a great jockey with a high-quality horse, magic happens – winning races for horse racing fans and great returns for shareholders. This year's Kentucky Derby features legendary jockey John Velazquez riding the odds-on favorite, Fierceness. Velazquez has won the Kentucky Derby three times before: in 2011 with Animal Kingdom, in 2017 with Always Dreaming, and in 2020 with Authentic. A win this year would tie him with Willie Shoemaker for the third-most wins, behind only Eddie Arcaro and Bill Hartack, who each have five victories. The role of a skilled jockey on a high-performing horse is analogous to that of a great CEO leading a successful company. Just as a talented jockey can guide a horse to victory, a competent CEO can steer a company towards success. Both must make critical decisions under pressure, adapt to changing circumstances, and optimize their assets to achieve the best possible outcome. Buffett has a stable of great CEOs who run businesses that Berkshire Hathaway owns completely or has minority positions in. Some are well-known, like James Quincey, who leads Coca-Cola\nCoca-Cola\n, or Todd Combs, CEO of GEICO. Others, like Pat Egan, who runs See's Candies, may be less famous but are equally talented. Horse racing involves substantial strategy and competition, with jockeys making split-second decisions and trainers meticulously preparing horses for each race. The ability to quickly recover from mistakes is also crucial. Buffett now readily admits that buying a faltering textile operation named Berkshire Hathaway was a poor decision. However, his longtime partner, Charlie Munger (who passed away in December at age 99), advised him on how to fix the mistake. The key, Munger said, was to \"give up buying fair businesses at wonderful prices\" and instead add \"wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices\" to Berkshire's portfolio. This year's Kentucky Derby features two first-time jockeys: Keith Asmussen, riding Just Steel, and Ryusei Sakai, riding Forever Young. Asmussen, the 25-year-old son of Hall of Fame trainer Steve Asmussen, will participate in his first Derby after less than two years of full-time riding. Sakai, a rising star in Japan, may bring good karma to the race, given Berkshire's success in Japan in recent years. While Warren Buffett won't be at Churchill Downs on Saturday, he will have his two favorite \"jockeys\" on stage with him at the Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting in Omaha: Greg Abel, who runs Berkshire's non-insurance operations and is in line to succeed Buffett as CEO, and Ajit Jain, who heads the insurance business. The author, a long time Berkshire Hathaway shareholder, favors the Japanese horse Forever Young to win Saturday's Kentucky Derby. He will attend the Berkshire annual meeting in Omaha with an eye toward Louisville. "

    "content": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. \n\t\tThanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.\t Thousands of fans line up outside for hours, there’s expensive merchandise and even a secret movie. When 40,000 people descend on Omaha, Nebraska, Saturday, it might sound like a Taylor Swift concert or a Coachella-style festival. Instead they will sit rapturously for five hours listening to a 93-year-old man answering questions on the economy — but not just any man: billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Welcome to the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting, dubbed “Woodstock for capitalism” and compared by attendees to going to church or seeing The Beatles live. Inside the CHI Health Center Omaha, ordinary shareholders mingle with celebrities — such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill Murray and Glenn Close — and the biggest names in business, including Bill Gates, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, and Apple’s Tim Cook.  The annual pilgrimage to Omaha is the most fanatical followers of Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, America’s 7th largest company, which owns companies including Geico, Dairy Queen, BNSF Railway and NetJets, and large stakes in Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz and Chevron.  The cost of admission is as low as $396, a single Berkshire Hathaway class B share, but the wisdom dispensed by the man with a net worth of $132 billion is, say attendees, priceless. Christopher Bloomstran has attended every year since 2000 — except once, when his daughter was born two weeks before the meeting— and calls it the “highlight of each year.” “I’ve met some of my best friends in the investment arena at the Berkshire,” said Bloomstran, who is chief investment officer of Semper Augustus Investments Group  in St. Louis, Missouri.  “I go Wednesday and often stay until Monday.”  Adam Mead, who runs Mead Capital Management and has been going for 10 years said: “I don’t go to church but it’s like church: You know what the message will be, it’s the same stories, and you hear current events through the lens of timeless wisdom. “Bill Gates is out there as is Jamie Dimon — he shook my hand and took a pic. One time Warren shook my hand. That was a memorable moment.” The weekend begins Friday when Omaha’s Conference Center opens for conference-goers to pick up credentials for the festivities which include the meeting, a picnic and a 5K. (Buffett does not take part.) But the event’s core is Saturday when Buffett and other Berkshire leaders address the crowd, many of whom arrive at 3am. Chris Fried, an attorney from Pennsylvania, who will be attending for the 10th time always stays in walking distance of the conference center so he is in line by 3AM and prepared for the “mad dash” for the best seats once the doors open and shareholders flood in.  “By 4am – I would say the line is about 100 feet deep,” he said. “By 7 am – it is down several blocks.” Fried said he stumbled on Berkshire when he first read Warren’s annual letter to shareholders 20 years ago.  “It read like beautiful poetry to me and I purchased my first B shares within the week. I haven’t looked back.” In the line he has met Buffett fans from as far afield as Australia, as well as Japan, China, Germany and the UK, many of whom have become friends. “You never know who you’ll bump into,” Friend adds. “One year I sat next to two NFL players.” Mead said: “I’ve made some of my really good friends out there just standing in line. I’m staying in an Airbnb with some of them this year.”  By 8:45AM attendees are ready for Buffett’s annual film which opens the event and which is never seen outside the hall.  Only two still images have ever leaked. One, in 2015, was a pastiche of “Breaking Bad,” with Buffett appearing with Bryan Cranston, its star, to cook, not meth, but See’s Candy, one of the brands which has made Buffett rich. Another, in 2002, was Buffett playing the ukelele.  “He has done skits with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bryan Cranston, Manny Pacquiao, and Jamie Lee Curtis,” Mac Sykes, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Equity Trust, who has been attending for 15 years said. “They’re worth arriving early for.”  This year will be different in part because Charlie Munger, Berkshire’s vice chair and Buffett’s on-stage sidekick until he died at 99 last November, won’t be there for the first time. Elie-Chakib Abou-Chacra, a portfolio manager from Canada who is attending for the second time, said the annual meeting is the equivalent of being a Beatles fan seeing McCartney perform onstage.  “I get to see my hero on stage… if you’re a fan of McCartney or an old rock guy you never know when it will be his last tour but you know you want to see them onstage before they go.” Off stage, the conference center features specialized merch from companies owned by Berkshire, including Squishmallow — who sell a Warren Buffett version of their plush toy — Brooks Sports, Fruit of the Loom, and Dairy Queen.  Buffett tours by golf cart, with people taking selfies as he passes. They also take photos with cutouts of him dotted around the floor. Last year See’s Candies sold Buffett’s fans 11 tons of confectionery which included “Warren’s Favorite Chocolate Walnut Fudge.” Stephen Tedder, an ophthalmologist from Atlanta, told The Post that he fell in love with Buffett’s wisdom after he stumbled on a Berkshire report during the 2008 financial crisis.  “You could see the authentic Midwest moral fiber of Warren and Charlie [Munger], their clarity of thought, written word and plain speak,” he told The Post. This will be his third meeting, having started coming in 2022, because he made a “growing number of good friends.”  Women make up just 20% of attendees, sources told The Post. April Samuelson, a tech worker from Chicago, has attended twice and each time had to explain why she was there solo. “The weird thing about attending as a woman is other investors tended to assume that I was a wife or girlfriend,” Samuelson said.  “I had to clarify that I had stock of my own. When asked why, I just went with ‘I like money.’” Advertisement"

    "content": "Fund next-gen business journalism with $10 a month Search Free Newsletters Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is hosting its annual shareholders meeting Friday through Sunday. The conference, dubbed “Woodstock for Capitalists” by its fans, is a three-day event hosted in Buffett’s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. It’s full of luxurious experiences for Berkshire shareholders, including cocktails, shopping for exclusive jewelry and furniture from top designers, and lots of Dairy Queen (which is owned by Berkshire). But shareholders come for more than just the enticing perks. They wait all year to attend the highly-watched conference for a chance to hear directly from Buffett, known as the Oracle of Omaha. This year, Berkshire vice chairs Ajit Jain and Greg Abel will field questions alongside Buffett during Saturday’s morning question-and-answer session, and Abel and Buffett  will continue on the afternoon shift. In a statement, Buffett said that the three men “will not get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked.” “We know you... will pick some tough ones and that’s the way we like it,” he said. The multinational business conglomerate has been headed by Buffett since 1965, and owns a wide portfolio of businesses mainly in the insurance, rail transportation, energy, manufacturing, and retail sectors. It also has significant holdings in a number of major consumer brands, including Kraft Heinz, American Express, Bank of America, and Coca-Cola. Berkshire has posted year-to-date total returns of almost 12%, outperforming the S&P 500's total returns of almost 8%. Here are three things to watch at this year’s event. During past Berkshire conferences, Buffett has touched on some of the hottest topics of the year, from the regional banking crisis to U.S.-China economic tensions and Bitcoin. This year, Buffett has said that questions about what stocks Berkshire is buying and selling — despite that being public information — are off the table for discussion. So is politics. Nevertheless, investors will likely want a glimpse into the Oracle’s views on the wars in the Gaza Strip and Ukraine, interest rates, and other policy issues that are relevant to Berkshire’s business and the wider economy.  Read more: Warren Buffett doesn’t trust pundits and more takeaways from his annual note to shareholders While he likely won’t comment on something as concrete as who he’s voting for in the year’s presidential election, there’s a good chance some policy discussion will make it into the Q&A session. There may also be questions about artificial intelligence and tech stocks, given Berkshire’s outsize holdings in Apple, Amazon, and cloud data-warehousing firm Snowflake. Mainly, people just like to hear what Buffett thinks about whatever he’s thinking about. Whether that’s life lessons or investment insights, when Buffett talks, investors listen. Abel, who serves as chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and vice-chairman of non-insurance operations, is in line to succeed the 93-year-old Buffett as CEO.  The Canadian businessman was tapped  as heir apparent in 2021, when Buffett told CNBC that if something were to happen to him that night, the board of directors was in agreement that “it would be Greg who’d take over tomorrow morning.” Abel will have a starring role this year, appearing at both Q&A sessions. During last year’s conference, the late Charlie Munger heaped praise on Abel, calling him “sensational at being a business leader, both as a thinker and as a doer.” “There’s some things he’s better at than Warren is, and Warren knows that, and he just keeps dumping on Greg everything that Greg can do better, and that’s a lot,” Munger said. This is the first annual Berkshire shareholders meeting without Buffett’s right-hand business partner and friend, Charlie Munger. Munger served as vice chairman of Berkshire since 1978. He died in November, just weeks before his 100th birthday.  Guests would often look forward to the pair’s anecdotes and humor — both business-related and not — which tended to be a highlight of the annual conference. One long-time conference attendee told The Wall Street Journal that this year’s meeting will have “an empty-chair feeling” to it without Munger.

    "content": "The claims have been filed in a state court in Portland as part of a class action lawsuit by 1,000 victims of the fires. PacifiCorp, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, is facing $30bn in claims from victims of the 2020 Labor Day wildfires in Oregon, US. The demand is a significant increase in the legal challenges faced by the utility, which is one of the largest grid operators in the country. \n                        The gold standard of business intelligence.\n                     \n                            Find out more\n                            \n\n\n\n The claims have been filed in a state court in Portland as part of a class action lawsuit by 1,000 victims seeking compensation for the destruction of 2,500 properties in western Oregon. Each claimant is seeking up to $30m – $5m for tangible losses and up to $25m for intangible losses such as emotional distress. The amount sought in the amended complaint is roughly two and a half times the value of the utility itself, and significantly exceeds payouts from all claims resolved to date. In a previous legal decision, a jury ordered PacifiCorp to pay $90m to 17 claimants for gross negligence due to the utility’s failure to shut down power lines during a windstorm.

Despite being found liable for its role in the fires, PacifiCorp is appealing the verdict and has criticised the plaintiffs’ demands as excessive. The company stated: “The $30m demand for each plaintiff clearly demonstrates the need for some manner of reform in the legal process. “PacifiCorp’s ability to provide essential services is being threatened by excessive wildfire damages pursued by plaintiff’s attorneys who have a substantial financial stake in these outcomes.” The issue of wildfire liability is not unique to PacifiCorp; it has become a concern for utilities across the western US, with Berkshire chairman Warren Buffett highlighting the risk in his annual letter to investors. Berkshire Hathaway has acknowledged facing fire claims in Oregon and California amounting to $8bn, including more than $1bn from government agencies for firefighting and clean-up costs.  The utility’s failure to act on weather warnings and shut off electricity ahead of the windstorm was a focal point of the 2023 trial.

    "content": "      Berkshire Hathaway Inc will announce its first quarter earnings on Saturday, May 4, 2024. The billionaire Warren Buffett-led company will hold its 2024 Annual Shareholders Meeting on May 4.     Prior to the Annual Shareholders Meeting, Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Greg Abel, Vice Chairman Non-Insurance Operations and Ajit Jain, Vice Chairman Insurance Operations, will hold a question-and-answer session that will commence at approximately 9:15 a.m. Central time, the company said.     The Berkshire Hathaway AGM, which attracts thousands of people to Omaha to hear from legendary investor Warren Buffett, won’t be the same this year due to the absence of his friend and investing partner Charlie Munger.  Also Read: ‘Empty chair feeling’ to pervade Berkshire meeting without Munger    Munger, who was the former Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman, passed away last November at 99 years old.     It will be for the first time when the Berkshire Hathaway AGM will be held without Munger alongside Buffett.    Traditionally, the duo shared insights into their investment portfolios and strategies, offering invaluable financial and life advice to investors.    In February, Buffett paid tribute to Munger when he prefaced his annual letter to shareholders with a page titled “Charlie Munger — The Architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"    “Charlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me take the bows and receive the accolades,\" Buffett wrote.

Discovery. Since April's labor report was weaker than expected, he said investors can worry less about the Federal Reserve's next move. \"Now that it's clear the economy's having a meaningful slowdown, we no longer need to worry about the Fed becoming our enemy again,\" he said, adding, \"Which means we can go back to glorious stock picking mode, at least for like a couple of days, thanks to the benign employment number.\" On Saturday, Cramer said investors should follow Warren Buffett's annual meeting, which could be bullish for Berkshire Hathaway and stocks in its portfolio such as American Express, Apple, Coca-Cola and Occidental Petroleum. Monday brings earnings from Simon Property Group and Tyson Foods, the latter of which Cramer said he thinks could be a \"bounce-back play.\" Disney reports on Tuesday before the bell, and Cramer said he expects results to be positive after the cost cuts and initiatives management put in place to win its recent proxy battle. Wynn Resorts and Reddit also release earnings that day, and Cramer said he thinks both could put up solid numbers. Cramer will be paying attention to Uber's report on Wednesday, saying he wonders whether its earnings will be hurt by competition from Lyft. Toyota, Arm, Robinhood, Trade Desk, AMC Entertainment and Airbnb also report. He said he thinks Robinhood will do well because cryptocurrency remains popular. Roblox reports Thursday and Cramer said he expects it to be positive. Warner Bros. Discovery also reports, and Cramer said he wonders whether the company has lowered its debt and if it will keep its contract with the National Basketball Association. He said he is also interested to hear from Akamai Technologies and Tapestry. The latter's report could address the Federal Trade Commission's suit to stop its merger with Capri. On Friday, Cramer will be waiting for earnings from Enbridge. He said some investors are skeptical the company can pay its dividend. To Cramer, the dividend is safe, but he said he needs to see more aggressive growth to justify owning the stock.

With over 20,000 square feet of showroom space and more than 50,000 items of inventory, the exhibit hall at the CHI Health Center features goodies from various Berkshire's holding companies, from Brooks Running to See's Candies to Jazwares. Only shareholders can participate at the event and they can buy items at a special discount. The annual meeting will be exclusively broadcast on CNBC and livestreamed on CNBC.com. The special coverage will begin Saturday at 9:30 a.m. ET. Jazwares, the American toymaker best known for its Squishmallows plushie line, was a hit last year when it first displayed its wares at Berkshire Hathaway's conference, including the debut of a Warren Buffett plushie. This year, the company expanded its exhibit in the convention hall, making it three times larger. Some highlights include the latest Squishmallows toys in the images of Buffett and his longtime Berkshire partner, Charlie Munger, a splashy Squishmallows pit, as well as other displays. The Bookworm only had one book to sell this year: \"Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Essential Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger.\" That was at the request of Buffett in honor of his business partner of more than 60 years, who passed away in November at the age of 99. See's Candies was once again a crowd pleaser at this year's \"Woodstock for Capitalists.\" The special box of assorted chocolates for the 2024 annual meeting, sold for $16 each, featured a cartoon image of Buffett and the iconic Mary See. Shareholders could pick up the Oracle of Omaha's favorite — chocolate walnut fudge — as well as customizable boxes at the booth. Berkshire acquired pilot training company FlightSafety in 1996. At Friday's shopping event, the firm brought a taste of what its training program looks like for professional pilots. Shareholders lined up to put on virtual reality glasses and experience the flight simulation training. Truck-stop giant Pilot Travel Centers put up a big display with a real-sized red truck. The firm is largest operator of travel centers in North America, with more than 750 locations. Berkshire now fully owns Pilot Travel after buying the remaining 20% ownership interest from the Haslam family. The deal was not without drama as the Haslams last year sued Berkshire in a complaint that accused the conglomerate of using so-called pushdown accounting without authorization from the family. About 14 miles away from the main convention center, there's a separate shareholder-only shopping event at Berkshire-owned Jewelry store Borsheims. Shareholders browsed through one-of-a-kind jewelry, engagement rings and watches available for purchase at a discount. This 40-carat diamond bracelet from Ruchi New York was selling for $110,000 (picture above, on the left). In 2016, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought Duracell from Procter & Gamble, offering the consumer giant $4.7 billion of the shares it owned in P&G in exchange for the battery maker. Brooks Running attracted a long line of shareholders snapping up the 2024 special edition of its running shoes with \"brk\" on the side and a cartoon of a running Buffett on the insoles. Many shareholders are also set to participate in the Brooks \"Invest in Yourself\" 5K fun run and walk on Sunday, the morning following the annual meeting. Warren Buffett bought Dairy Queen in 1998 in a roughly $600 million transaction, and has made trips to the Omaha locations with his great-grandchildren. According to The Wall Street Journal, the billionaire investor has said in the past that his favorite DQ order is a vanilla soft serve topped with chocolate syrup and malted milk power.

You can opt out anytime.\t\t\t\t Tomorrow (May 4), Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) will kick off its annual shareholder meeting in the investing conglomerate’s home base in Omaha, Neb. This year, Buffett will host the meeting without his right-hand man, Charlie Munger, who passed away late last year at the age of 99. Thousands of Berkshire shareholders will look for updates on  Buffett’s succession plan as well as his next big bet, as the company is also set to report first-quarter earnings tomorrow morning. It will not be the first time Buffett leads the shareholder meeting by himself, though. He held Berkshire’s 2020 meeting—virtually due to Covid-19—without Munger and said, “It particularly doesn’t feel like an annual meeting because my partner of 60 years, Charlie Munger, is not sitting up here.” Munger’s passing in November put Berkshire’s energy business chief Greg Abel and insurance chief Ajit Jain in the spotlight. In 2021, Munger revealed at that year’s shareholder meeting that Abel would succeed Buffett as CEO if anything happened to the CEO. “The directors are in agreement that if something were to happen to me tonight, it would be Greg who’d take over tomorrow morning,” Buffett told CNBC subsequently. He added that, if for some reason Abel couldn’t do the job, Jain would step in as CEO. Abel, 59, and Jain, 70, were promoted to vice chairmen of Berkshire Hathaway’s board in 2018 and have taken on a larger role in recent years. “Ajit and Greg have rare talents, and Berkshire blood flows through their veins,” Buffett wrote in his 2018 letter to shareholders.  In April this year, Abel joined Buffett on his business trip to Japan, where he made large investments in the country’s top trading houses. Abel “does all the work, and I take the bows—it’s exactly what I wanted,” Buffett told CNBC at the time. Another item in focus at tomorrow’s meeting will be Buffett’s next big bet, especially given Berkshire’s giant cash pile. At the end of 2023, Berkshire had a record $168 billion in cash. Shareholders are eager to know how Buffett plans to invest that money. During the December quarter, Berkshire reduced its stake in Apple (its largest holding), Paramount Global and HP while increasing shares in Chevron, Occidental Petroleum and Sirius XM Holdings. Also late last year, Berkshire acquired a mystery stock that the company requested the SEC for permission to keep confidential. Shareholders may expect the company to share more details about that as well. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

He's emerged in recent years as one of Apple's top evangelists. At the end of 2023, Berkshire owned about 6% of Apple, a stake worth $174 billion at the time, or about 40% of the conglomerate's total value. That's about four times bigger than Berkshire's second-biggest public stock holding, Bank of America, and makes the company the No. 2 Apple shareholder, behind only Vanguard. As Berkshire investors and fanboys of the 93-year-old Buffett flood Omaha this weekend for the 2024 annual meeting, Apple is likely to be a hot topic of discussion. The tech giant on Thursday reported a 10% year-over-year decline in iPhone sales, leading to a 4% drop in total revenue. But the stock had its best day since late 2022 on Friday due largely to a $110 billion stock buyback plan and increased margins that result from a growing services business. The bet on Apple and CEO Tim Cook has paid off handsomely for Buffett, who said in 2022 that the cost of Berkshire's Apple stake was only $31 billion. His firm is up almost 620% on its investment since the start of 2016. Despite being a self-described Luddite, Buffett has long had a coherent non-techie thesis for loving Apple. He's seen how devoted Apple users are to their devices, and has viewed the iPhone as an extraordinary product that could keep its customers spending inside the Apple ecosystem. He calls it a moat, one of his favorite words for describing his preferred businesses. \"Apple has a position with consumers that they're paying $1,500 or whatever it may be for a phone, and these same people pay $35,000 for a second car,\" Buffett said at last year's meeting. \"And if they had to give up their second car or give up their iPhone, they'd give up their second car!\" Data is in his favor. According to a study from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, Apple benefits from 94% customer loyalty, meaning that nine out of 10 current U.S. iPhone owners choose another iPhone when buying a new device. Buffett also has hailed Apple's ability to return billions of dollars to shareholders annually through share buybacks and dividends, a capital allocation strategy for which the billionaire investor may have himself to thank. When the Apple CEO was asked in a 2016 interview with The Washington Post who he turns to for advice at pivotal moments, Cook offered up a story about his relationship with Buffett. \"When I was going through [the question of] what should we do on returning cash to shareholders, I thought who could really give us great advice here? Who wouldn't have a bias?\" Cook said. \"So I called up Warren Buffett. I thought he's the natural person.\" Apple has shown its appreciation for the Oracle of Omaha in other ways. In 2019, the company published an original iPhone game called \"Warren Buffett's Paper Wizard\" in which a paperboy bikes from Omaha to Apple's hometown of Cupertino, California. But with Apple's business having declined in size in five of the past six quarters and with the company expecting just low single-digit growth in the current quarter, Buffett may face questions this weekend at the shareholder meeting about whether he still sees the same power in the moat, particularly with regulatory pressures building around tech's mega-cap companies. Buffett trimmed his stake in Apple late last year, though only by about 1%. Even after Friday's rally, the stock is down 3.8% in 2024, while the S&P 500 is up 7.5%. Berkshire's initial foray into Apple in 2016 was not Buffett's idea. Rather, the investment was led by Ted Weschler, one of his top deputies, and was seen as a passing of the torch to the next generation of Berkshire investment managers. But the following year, Berkshire started purchasing even more Apple shares, and Buffett began talking it up. He said he liked the stock and the company's \"sticky\" product, although he didn't use it. In 2018, he said Apple users are \"very, very, very locked in, at least psychologically and mentally\" to the product and the ecosystem. \"Apple has an extraordinary consumer franchise,\" he said. At last year's annual meeting, when asked how Berkshire can defend having Apple make up so much of its public portfolio, Buffett said, \"It just happens to be a better business than any we own.\" He also hailed Cook, calling him one of the \"best managers in the world.\" A number Apple likes to use to tout the health of its business, despite the declining revenue, is \"2.2 billion.\" That's how many devices the company says are currently in use and points to the massive customer base available as Apple rolls out new subscription services. \"Once customers get into the ecosystem, they don't leave. So it's not a speculative tech play,\" said Dan Eye, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which owns Apple shares. \"It's kind of more like an annuity and I think that's what Warren Buffett really sees as well.\" In addition to the drop in revenue, Apple faces new challenges from regulations and weak overseas markets, as well as from Microsoft and Google's advancements in artificial intelligence. For regulators, the concern surrounds the very moat that Buffett finds so attractive, and whether it gives the company monopolistic control in the smartphone market. The U.S. government in March alleged that Apple designs its business to keep customers locked in. The Department of Justice's lawsuit claimed that products like Apple Card, the Apple Arcade game subscription, iMessage and Apple Watch work best or only with an iPhone, creating illegal barriers to competition and making it harder for consumers to switch when it's time for an upgrade. However, the litigation is expected to take years, pushing any potential penalties to Apple and its products well into the future. In the meantime, there's no sign that the iPhone is becoming less important as new devices like virtual reality goggles have found only niche audiences, while consumer AI products have failed to take off. Buffett hasn't voiced his view publicly on Apple's regulatory hurdles, and this will be the first opportunity for investors to ask him about the issue since the DOJ's lawsuit. But Buffett knows a little something about regulation — two markets where he's most active are railroads and insurance. In a note to clients earlier this month, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi didn't go deep on regulatory concerns, but mentioned that he doesn't believe the DOJ suit will \"seriously threaten\" the strength of Apple's ecosystem. He also said that following Buffett's lead on getting in and out of Apple is a solid strategy for making money. \"Despite his reputation as a long term buy and hold investor, Warren Buffett has been remarkably disciplined at adding to his Apple position when it is relatively cheap and trimming when it is relatively expensive,\" Sacconaghi wrote. He encouraged investors to \"be like Buffett.\" Odds are that Buffett was thrilled with Apple's announcement this week regarding its expanded repurchase program. It's a practice he's long adored. \"When I buy Apple, I know that Apple is going to repurchase a lot of shares,\" he said in 2018.  And he likes to note how buybacks result in getting a bigger stake in the company without buying more shares. \"The math of repurchases grinds away slowly, but can be powerful over time,\" Buffett said in 2021. Apple also increased its dividend by 4%, and signaled that it would continue to lift it annually. Buffett was effusive about the tech giant's capital-return strategy at the conglomerate's annual meeting last year, pointing out that it helped Berkshire own a bigger piece of the pie. Unlike insurance company Geico and homebuilder Clayton Homes, which his firm owns in their entirety, Berkshire can continue to increase its stake in Apple, a fact he reminded investors of at the meeting. \"The good thing about Apple is that we can go up,\" Buffett said.

    "content": "3D Rendering Of Magnet with Group of People. Shareholder clienteles perhaps matter less if your stock is on a tear. Absent that, publicly listed companies would do well to court an anchor long term owner to partner with to stick to a strategy of patient investment.  The marketing folks spent an enormous amount of time crafting products for the right customer clientele. A lot of thought usually goes into thinking about the demographics of the customer (age, gender, marital status, occupation), their geographical location (US and Canada, EMEA or Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia, or micro markets in the US) and other characteristics such as culture and language, their interests, behavior, and perceived status. One can segment customers along literally infinite dimensions. This discussion had me thinking about whether CEOs and CFOs put in this much thought into cultivating shareholder clienteles. As an illustration, I thought I should go pull up some data on changes in shareholder segments over the last 10 years for one company as a case study: IBM. I picked IBM because it is often accused of missing at least three technology waves: mobile computing, cloud computing and AI. I wanted to check whether value or dividend yield focused investors pressured management to pay out dividends at the cost of long-term investments. IBM’s competitors such as Amazon and Microsoft have somehow avoided these arguably myopic pressures. Perhaps as a consequence, IBM’s stock returns have underperformed the S&P 500 and even a US treasury ETF over the last 10 years. Let’s get to the data. As per S&P’s CAP IQ database, roughly 60% of IBM is owned by institutions with the remaining 40% held by the public, presumably individuals and unidentified others. Of the portion owned by institutions, CAP IQ states that 84% is held by what the database calls “traditional investment managers,” 8% is owned by banks/investment banks, 3% by government pension sponsors and 2% by hedge fund managers. I pulled out data for the top owners of IBM over the last 10 years (March 2014 compared with December 2023) to check whether there is a steady clientele of shareholders interested in owning the stock. I picked 10 years to represent a potential cycle where investments begin to fetch returns. Perhaps that is too long but it’s a reasonable starting point. Here is what I found: IBM shareholders from 2013-2024 In the table above, ownership refers to the latest available data on how much of IBM is currently owned by these investors. The column 2023 over 2014 simply divides the proportion of stock owned by the investor in December 2023 by that owned in March 2014. This column suggests that Vanguard and BlackRock have increased their ownership over the last decade by 46-50% even as IBM’s stock has tanked. If I were the CFO of IBM, who can I chat with to discuss long term strategy assuming that they will stay with me as a shareholder for a long horizon? And I was left scratching my head for good answers. The three biggest owners are BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, collectively accounting for 23.2% of the company. Why? Because IBM is a part of several indexes and the Big Three, by and large, hold indexed investments. Does the Big Three have the time, bandwidth, interest, and the legal clearance to engage in deep discussions with IBM over long term strategy? Most probably not, as alluded to by my joint work on the Big Three’s engagement record. What should one make of the remaining investors? Perhaps the state pension funds, Calpers and Norges, can be useful long-term partners? What should one make of the several banks that own stock in IBM? Are they being held in the “street name” for someone else? Do these banks have any interest in engaging with IBM over strategy? What about the asset managers in the list? Many, if not most, sell mutual funds of every conceivable, often contradictory, style such as value, growth, quality, and the like. They are, in effect, a supermarket of several investing styles and arguably do not have a particular view over how IBM should be run. Where does this leave the CFO and the Investor Relations arm of IBM? · For sure, there is a lot of churn among positions and owners over the last 10 years. The pressure to cater to these transient investors to get through a quarter or two must surely be intense. · Why do CFOs worry so much about doing well in quarterly earnings conference calls, apart from of course their inherent competitive instinct to do well at whatever they do and the short term nature of most executive compensation? Surely analysts are not investors! · The other day, a senior CFO shared the following amusing but disturbing anecdote: “XX firm, a very prominent mutual fund shop, without blinking an eyelid tells us, “We are long term investors. Our holding period is 18 months!” Meetings with this mutual fund shop in New York represents a peanut gallery of 18 odd fund managers of individual funds, probing the CFO for cues on whether they should actually hold the stock for 18 months.” How is this interaction useful to the company for generating long term value? · Analysts tend to ask for quarterly earnings guidance. Could companies with stable long-term owners arguably pay less attention to guidance and more to their long-term investment plans? Berkshire Hathaway does not give earnings guidance, for example. · What pressure does the retail investor exert on IBM? Not a lot except perhaps a desire for good dividend yields? How has that changed with rising interest rates? · What, if anything, can IBM do to seek out a different investor clientele? Would an anchor owner who can partner with IBM with patient capital lay the foundation for rapid growth? I have often said in my classes that we almost need a new investor class: public private equity. By that I mean, someone who is willing to hold under-performing public companies for a long time (7-10 years) and is willing to work with management to release hidden value in the under-performer. When I put this to a few CFOs and board members, they generally said that finding the right clientele is just very hard. The recommendation is that a firm like IBM needs to articulate a clear strategy, preferably one that targets growth. And then the firm needs to provide proof points of success, repeatedly. Eventually, over time, which may mean five years, the “right” clientele, will come along. Success brings in momentum investors or even growth investors who may stay with you till you keep growing. Once growth stalls or if the prospects of growth stalls, momentum and growth investors leave. Even a self-professed value investor such as Warren Buffett, famously held IBM for seven years, and gave up in 2018-19 to pick up Apple. Buffett arguably got fed up with the lack of a coherent strategy to turn IBM around. Some of this sounds circular. Value investors in my stock will not let me set aside significant capital for risky investments to eventually grow as they want to be paid dividends and share buybacks. Perhaps the trick is to somehow shed the value guys by grabbing the initiative and moving ahead with a growth plan. The value folks may sell in the short run leading to a short term fall in the stock price. But, a short term hit may be better than long term stasis. Assuming a firm has a reasonable strategy, perhaps another tactic may be to seek out an anchor owner who will serve the role of the public private equity firm. As an example, Bill Gates’ fund, Cascade Investment LLC, is the largest non-index owner of John Deere (7% owner). Cascade has held concentrated stakes in Republic Services, Ecolab, and Auto Nation for years. Indeed, research by my colleague, Kalash Jain at Columbia, suggests that stocks held by the same non-index investor for a long duration outperform the market. Is it time for the CFO and the IR folks to think harder about finding the right shareholder clientele and hopefully escape the grind of transient investors and performative quarterly conference calls? Of course, the best place to start is to come up with a credible growth strategy and deliver results.  One Community.

O encontro anual de acionistas da Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), empresa do megainvestidor Warren Buffett, será no sábado (4) – e quem se deslocou até o interior dos Estados Unidos para participar está cheio de expectativa. “Estar entre tantos investidores de ponta é um aprendizado por si só, e ver Buffett falando sobre a Berkshire e o mercado é uma oportunidade”, diz o analista brasileiro Rodrigo Medeiros, que está pela primeira vez no evento. “Ver presencialmente é diferente de ver pela internet”. Leia também: InfoMoney vai a Omaha para conferência anual da Berkshire Hathaway, de Warren Buffett Continua depois da publicidade A reunião da Berkshire é diferente da maioria dos encontros com acionistas promovidos por outras empresas. De um lado, o dia é uma vitrine para as muitas companhias nas quais Buffett tem participação – elas montam estandes na CHI Health Center Arena, em Omaha, no estado de Nebraska, onde ocorre o evento. De outro, os participantes têm a chance real de fazer perguntas diretamente a Buffett – que será acompanhado no palco por Greg Abel, responsável pelas operações não relacionadas a seguros da Berkshire, e por Ajit Jain, que supervisiona especificamente os negócios de seguros. Os três podem responder até 60 perguntas durante a reunião. Baixe um ebook gratuito que revela o método Warren Buffett de investir em ações Continua depois da publicidade Eliseu Manica Júnior gostaria que uma das perguntas respondidas fosse a sua. Ele é o fundador da Experato, assessoria de investimentos de Santo Ângelo, no Rio Grande do Sul, e está entre as dezenas de brasileiros participantes da conferência deste ano. É sua quinta vez no evento – e nessa, perguntaria a Buffett: “Com a ascensão de novas tecnologias, como inteligência artificial e blockchain, como o senhor adapta sua estratégia de investimento para identificar e avaliar as vantagens competitivas duráveis em empresas, especialmente aquelas que operam em setores tradicionais?” Da comunidade brasileira ouvida pelo InfoMoney em Omaha, Manica Júnior está entre os investidores “veteranos” na Berkshire – ele tem os papéis desde 2019, período em que calcula ter ganhado cerca de 100% com eles. Já Lucas Biolchini, analista da XP Asset, é mais recente na base acionária da empresa. Investe há cerca de um ano e meio, com ganhos de 30%. Ir à conferência era um desejo antigo, diz Biolchini, acelerado pelo falecimento de Charlie Munger – o sócio de longa data de Buffett morreu em novembro de 2023, aos 99 anos. “A chance de ‘respirar o ar de Omaha’ e de conhecer pessoas do mundo todo que também têm Buffett, Munger e a Berkshire como inspirações me animou”. Sua pergunta ao megainvestidor? Continua depois da publicidade “Perguntaria sobre os recentes investimentos em empresas japonesas, para entender melhor sua visão sobre o perfil de crescimento delas e a alocação de capital” A edição de 2024 também é a estreia de Renato Breia, sócio-fundador da Nord Investimentos, nas conferências da Berkshire. Só a “caravana” da Nord seguiu para Omaha com 12 pessoas. “Faria a ele uma pergunta sobre investimento de longo prazo”, diz. “ Com o mundo mudando tão rapidamente rápido , o ‘long term investment’ ficou mais ‘short’? As mudanças no portfólio dele também aceleraram” Entre outras perguntas que podem ser endereçadas a Buffett há temas mais espinhosos – riscos climáticos, por exemplo. A empresa de energia PacifiCorp – que está no portfólio da Berkshire – é alvo de reclamações de responsabilidade por incêndios no Oregon em 2020. Outras investidas também enfrentaram litígios que podem despertar a curiosidade dos investidores. A imobiliária HomeServices of America assinou recentemente um acordo de US$ 250 milhões (R$ 1,3 bilhão) para liquidar uma ação judicial envolvendo comissões pagas aos corretores. Ainda nesta semana, foi alvo de uma nova reclamação de um grupo de compradores de casas, acusando a corretora de inflacionar as comissões. Continua depois da publicidade Buffett costuma ver seu vasto império empresarial como um barômetro da saúde econômica dos EUA – e muitos investidores devem buscar indicações quanto a isso na sessão de perguntas e respostas. A inflação e os juros mais altos podem pesar sobre os negócios industriais, de serviços e de varejo da Berkshire, embora essas operações tenham se mostrado resilientes. No ano passado, ele previu que a maioria das empresas da Berkshire reportaria ganhos mais baixos – o que não aconteceu. A empresa teve lucros operacionais de US$ 8,48 bilhões no quarto trimestre, acima dos US$ 6,63 bilhões do ano anterior. Também haverá quem queira saber sobre um problema, digamos, sui generis que a Berkshire enfrenta nos últimos tempos: excesso de dinheiro sem ter em que gastar, uma vez que os valuations elevados nas bolsas reduziram o rol de empresas candidatas. Continua depois da publicidade O caixa da empresa saltou para um recorde de US$ 167,6 bilhões no final de 2023 – e os analistas preveem que o volume poderá ter crescido nos resultados que a Berkshire vai anunciar no sábado. “Buffett vai manter essa posição de caixa até que as pessoas fiquem mais negativas em relação às ações”, diz Bill Smead, diretor de investimentos da Smead Capital Management.

Mas o evento deste ano será o primeiro sem a presença de Munger, que morreu em novembro aos 99 anos, e ocorre em meio a dúvidas cada vez maiores sobre a Berkshire depois de Buffett, que hoje está com 93 anos. Continua depois da publicidade Baixe um ebook gratuito que revela o método Warren Buffett de investir em ações Neste sábado (4), Buffett terá ao seu lado uma equipe diferente respondendo às perguntas. Greg Abel e Ajit Jain, vice-presidentes da Berkshire, estarão presentes durante grande parte do dia. Os acionistas provavelmente estarão focados no que Abel, o sucessor nomeado por Buffett para assumir o cargo de CEO e responsável pelas operações não relacionadas a seguros do conglomerado, terá a dizer. Na carta anual de Buffett aos investidores, ele fez referência aos desafios enfrentados pelas maiores empresas da Berkshire, dentre as quais a ferrovia BNSF (queda nos volumes de embarques) e seu negócio de utilities (incêndios florestais). No mês passado, a enorme corretora imobiliária da empresa, a HomeServices of America, também concordou em desembolsar US$ 250 milhões para fechar acordos em processos judiciais relativos a comissões inflacionadas por vendas de imóveis.

Certamente haverá muitas perguntas sobre os investimentos exclusivos da Berkshire. O desempenho das ações da empresa este ano ultrapassou o da Apple (um dos maiores investimentos de Buffett; leia mais sobre isso abaixo), da Microsoft e da Tesla, bem como o do S&P 500. Continua depois da publicidade Com as taxas de juros permanecendo mais elevadas por mais tempo e as ações de muitos gigantes da tecnologia perdendo força, os acionistas estarão interessados em saber onde Buffett enxerga oportunidades futuras. Elas podem incluir investimentos da empresa na petroleira Occidental Petroleum e em cinco tradings japoneses, cujas ações dispararam. Os participantes também podem desejar ouvir Buffett explicar qual teria sido sua admissão mais significativa nos últimos anos: hoje, a Berkshire é tão grande que é pouco provável que ela encontre quaisquer aquisições importantes – a fonte histórica dos descomunais retornos sobre os investimentos de Buffett – na qual gastar sua fabulosa fortuna estimada em US$ 163 bilhões. “Em suma, não haverá um desempenho de encher os olhos”, escreveu Buffet na carta anual deste ano. E pode haver incertezas sobre quem será responsável por selecionar as ações para Buffett. Todd Combs e Ted Weschler gerenciam partes do portfólio de investimentos da Berkshire há anos. No entanto, o desempenho deles tem ficado muito aquém do alcançado pelo próprio Buffett e do S&P 500, o que levanta dúvidas sobre a futura proposta de valor da Berkshire.

    "description": "For divestment from Israel to actually work, students and administrators must change their tactics, writes Scott Warren.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-03T17:11:13Z",
    "content": "As a former student activist, it’s been a surreal experience following the pro-Palestinian protests occurring at universities across the country. Almost 20 years ago, I helped lead national efforts across the country to divest universities, cities, and states from foreign companies aiding and abetting the genocide in Darfur, Sudan—the last effort that inspired massive divestiture action from institutions of higher education across the country. Despite our successful divestment efforts, the situation in Darfur is once again at a dire point, with a humanitarian disaster looming. This time, very few are sounding the alarm. Looking back on our efforts to divest American entities from companies in Sudan, two critical lessons emerge: First, a targeted approach to divestment is crucial to any potential campaign victory. Secondly, divestment on its own, while potentially important, is ultimately an insufficient tool in materially changing the situation on the ground, especially without long-term, sustained activism and engagement. In 2005, the genocide in Darfur captured the attention of thousands of college students across the country. Protesting a regime that massacred up to 400,000 of its own people through use of militia groups in the western region of Sudan, students organized massive protests in Washington, DC and their own campuses, pushed for congressional action, and engaged in acts of civil disobedience. Students also helped to lead a nationwide divestment movement, lobbying universities and states to pull their investments out of companies directly or indirectly aiding the government to carry out the atrocities. Ultimately,  35 states, including California and Texas, divested from Sudan, and over 50 universities participated in the effort. I helped to lead national efforts as the Student Director for STAND: A Student Anti-Genocide Coalition, and worked on successful campaigns to convince my alma-mater Brown University, the City of Providence, and the State of Rhode Island to divest their assets from Sudan. We engaged in a purposefully targeted approach, using research to determine lists of specific companies that were engaged in business activities that could be demonstrated to support and facilitate the Sudanese government’s internationally recognized genocidal actions and human rights violations. This list included Chinese and Russian oil and gas companies, as it could be proven that oil revenues helped pad the coffers of the murderous regime. The divestiture efforts were also explicitly targeted at universities’ direct investments, which comprise only about 5% of most endowments. Indeed, in a case like Brown, the university was not directly invested in any of the companies targeted, but rather, put them on a do-not-invest list as a result of our efforts. The rest of the university endowment is invested in commingled or mutual funds (this reality did lead to students pushing fund managers like Fidelity Investments and Berkshire Hathaway to divest from Sudan). Recognizing that the primary responsibility of the investment office is to secure a high rate of return for fiduciaries, and not to make political statements, this targeted approach also enables investment managers to easily replace any divested assets with similar companies. It’s difficult to speak to every university’s current demands for divestment concerning Israel, but focusing on Brown University’s campaign may be instructive. First, Brown’s response has stood out because the University Administration agreed to present divestment from Israel as an option to Brown’s Corporation, which is the equivalent of the Board of Directors. Given the vast number of universities that divested from Sudan, and in the 1990’s from South Africa, most institutions have a process in place to explore the financial action. Irrespective of their opinions on the merits of divestment in this case, it’s disappointing that, at a base level, most administrators are refusing to even explore these processes. Read More: What to Know About the Global Boycott Movement Against Israel Secondly, Brown’s campaign has been specific about its demands for divestiture. The students are not asking for divestment from every company linked to Israel (which is the unrealistic ask of Columbia University students) or even Israeli companies (which University of Michigan students want).  Brown Divest has stated its goal is “divestment from companies which profit from human rights abuses in Palestine.” In that vein, the group has outlined criteria to identify such companies, including those that provide products or services that contribute to the maintenance of the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, and those that provide products or services that contribute to violent acts. From this criteria, the students identified 10 specific companies that would be targeted for divestment. This is not to argue that Brown should, or will, divest from these companies.  But the process of identifying criteria, focusing on a university's direct investments, and presenting recommendations to the Corporation for a vote are all responsible actions by the students and administrators alike. This targeted campaign is the only approach towards divestment that has any potential for success. Even if targeted divestment efforts are successful, the most important question, which remains currently unanswerable, is whether these campaigns would actually make a difference on the ground. Despite our successful divestment campaigns 20 years ago, Darfur is collapsing yet again. Sudan’s military is engaged in a fight for power with the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group, causing the biggest humanitarian crisis in decades. There are concrete actions that the United States can take, including pushing for negotiations, engaging in targeted sanctions, and leading anti-money laundering measures. This time around, however, there is essentially no domestic political will for taking action. Student activism has died out for the cause. It’s counterproductive to engage in conflict comparisons between Gaza and Sudan. Student activists today would argue that U.S. taxpayers are subsidizing the Israeli government’s actions, whereas the situation in Sudan is less directly tied to our actions. Both situations, however, are tragic, and tens of thousands innocent human lives are being lost. If student activists today want to make a difference in the situation in Gaza, there are lessons to be learned from our work in Sudan. First, if they want to be successful in divestiture efforts, the work needs to be targeted. And secondly, students must recognize that the work to push for a peaceful Middle East will take a generation. I look at the protests today with a deep belief in the power of collective action and recognizing students’ rights to organize in the face of injustice. I also note that this issue is much more contentious than the genocide in Darfur, which was universally condemned by Americans. What is clear, though, is that both the protestors and university administrators need to change their tactics. It’s imperative that today’s student activists do not look back in 15 years with a situation in Gaza that mirrors, or is worse, than today’s morass. Contact us at letters@time.com"

The identity of the stock — or stocks — that Berkshire has been snapping up could be revealed Saturday at the company's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. That's because unless Berkshire has been granted confidential treatment on the investment for a third quarter in a row, the stake will be disclosed in filings later this month. So the 93-year-old Berkshire CEO may decide to explain his rationale to the thousands of investors flocking to the gathering. The bet, shrouded in mystery, has captivated Berkshire investors since it first appeared in disclosures late last year. At a time when Buffett has been a net seller of stocks and lamented a dearth of opportunities capable of \"truly moving the needle at Berkshire,\" he has apparently found something he likes — and in the financial realm no less. That's an area he has dialed back on in recent years over concerns about rising loan defaults. High interest rates have taken a toll on some financial players like regional U.S. banks, while making the yield on Berkshire's cash pile in instruments like T-bills suddenly attractive. \"When you are the GOAT of investing, people are interested in what you think is good,\" said Glenview Trust Co. Chief Investment Officer Bill Stone, using an acronym for greatest of all time. \"What makes it even more exciting is that banks are in his circle of competence.\" Under Buffett, Berkshire has trounced the S&P 500 over nearly six decades with a 19.8% compounded annual gain, compared with the 10.2% yearly rise of the index. Coverage note: The annual meeting will be exclusively broadcast on CNBC and livestreamed on CNBC.com. Our special coverage will begin Saturday at 9:30 a.m. ET. Berkshire requested anonymity for the trades because if the stock was known before the conglomerate finished building its position, others would plow into the stock as well, driving up the price, according to David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland. Buffett is said to control roughly 90% of Berkshire's massive stock portfolio, leaving his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler the rest, Kass said. While investment disclosures give no clue as to what the stock could be, Stone, Kass and other Buffett watchers believe it is a multibillion-dollar wager on a financial name. That's because the cost basis of banks, insurers and finance stocks owned by the company jumped by $3.59 billion in the second half of last year, the only category to increase, according to separate Berkshire filings. At the same time, Berkshire exited financial names by dumping insurers Markel and Globe Life, leading investors to estimate that the wager could be as large as $4 billion or $5 billion through the end of 2023. It's unknown whether that bet was on one company or spread over multiple firms in an industry. If it were a classic Buffett bet — a big stake in a single company —  that stock would have to be a large one, with perhaps a $100 billion market capitalization. Holdings of at least 5% in publicly traded American companies trigger disclosure requirements. Investors have been speculating for months about what the stock could be. Finance covers all manner of companies, from retail lenders to Wall Street brokers, payments companies and various sectors of insurance. Charles Schwab or Morgan Stanley could fit the bill, according to James Shanahan, an Edward Jones analyst who covers banks and Berkshire Hathaway. \"Schwab was beaten down during the regional banking crisis last year, they had an issue where retail investors were trading out of cash into higher-yielding investments,\" Shanahan said. \"Nobody wanted to own that name last year, so Buffett could've bought as much as he wanted.\" Other names that have been circulated — JPMorgan Chase or BlackRock, for example, are possible, but may make less sense given valuations or business mix. Truist and other higher-quality regional banks might also fit Buffett's parameters, as well as insurer AIG, Shanahan said, though their market capitalizations are smaller. Berkshire has owned financial names for decades, and Buffett has stepped in to inject capital — and confidence — into the industry on multiple occasions. Buffett served as CEO of a scandal-stricken Salomon Brothers in the early 1990s to help turn the company around. He pumped $5 billion into Goldman Sachs in 2008 and another $5 billion into Bank of America in 2011, ultimately becoming the latter's largest shareholder. But after loading up on lenders in 2018, from universal banks like JPMorgan to regional lenders like PNC Financial and U.S. Bank, he deeply pared his exposure to the sector in 2020 on concerns that the coronavirus pandemic would punish the industry. Since then, he and his deputies have mostly avoided adding to his finance stakes, besides modest positions in Citigroup and Capital One. Last May, Buffett told shareholders to expect more turbulence in banking. He said Berkshire could deploy more capital in the industry, if needed. \"The situation in banking is very similar to what it's always been in banking, which is that fear is contagious,\" Buffett said. \"Historically, sometimes the fear was justified, sometimes it wasn't.\" Wherever he placed his bet, the move will be seen as a boost to the company, perhaps even the sector, given Buffett's track record of identifying value. It's unclear how long regulators will allow Berkshire to shield its moves. \"I'm hopeful he'll reveal the name and talk about the strategy behind it,\" Shanahan said. \"The SEC's patience can wear out, at some point it'll look like Berkshire's getting favorable treatment.\" — CNBC's Yun Li contributed to this report.

Many speculate this year's will be a tear-jerker tribute to Munger. Vice Chairman of Non-Insurance Operations Greg Abel, Buffett's designated successor, will fill Munger's seat in the afternoon session, helping answer shareholder questions. Vice Chairman of Insurance Operations Ajit Jain will join Buffett, the CEO, and Abel in the morning session. Buffett has said they expect to field about 40 to 60 questions Saturday. \"The tone of the meeting is certainly going to be a lot different without Charlie,\" said Steve Check, CEO of Check Capital Management and a longtime Berkshire shareholder. \"He was the one that really made it funny. It's getting closer and closer to the transition, so it's good to see Ajit and Greg on the stage.\" Munger's investment philosophy rubbed off on Buffett early on, giving rise to the sprawling conglomerate worth $860 billion that Berkshire is today. Generations of investors also appreciated Munger's trademark bluntness and humor, rare to come by on Wall Street. If anything, the sea of Buffett admirers will cherish his folksy wisdom even more as the \"Oracle of Omaha\" turns 94 in less than four months. Here are some of the big topics shareholders want Buffett to discuss: The annual meeting comes at a tricky time for markets as a pickup in inflation puts the brakes on the Federal Reserve's plan to cut interest rates this year. While the Berkshire CEO doesn't make investment decisions based on daily headlines, investors still are eager to hear any market commentary and guidance from the protege of the father of value investing, Ben Graham. \"They don't time their investments,\" Kass said of Berkshire. \"The economy goes through cycles. They totally ignore cycles. They invest for a long run, and they really ignore what pretty much what the Federal Reserve is doing. I believe that will be his answer.\" Shareholders may seek an explanation as to why Berkshire sold about 10 million Apple shares (1% of its massive stake) in the fourth quarter. At the end of 2023, Berkshire owned 905,560,000 shares of the iPhone maker, worth more than $174 billion and taking up more than 40% of the portfolio. The move came as a surprise to many because Apple has been Buffett's favorite stock for years, and he even called the tech giant his second-most important business after Berkshire's cluster of insurers. What's more, the last time Buffett trimmed this bet, he admitted it was \"probably a mistake.' Shares of the iPhone maker got a big boost Friday after the firm announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in company history. However, Apple posted a decline in overall sales and in iPhone sales. There's a small chance that Buffett will reveal the identity of the mystery bank stock that Berkshire has been buying for two quarters straight. In the third and fourth quarters of 2023, Berkshire requested that the Securities and Exchange Commission keep the details of one or more of its stock holdings confidential. Many speculated that the secret purchase could be a bank stock as the conglomerate's cost basis for \"banks, insurance, and finance\" equity holdings jumped by around $2.37 billion. \"He will comment as late as possible.... Charlie would be the only one that would let it slip once in a while. It's not going to happen with Warren,\" Check said. Berkshire's succession could be front and center at this meeting after Munger's passing. Abel, became known as Buffett's heir apparent in 2021 after Munger inadvertently made the revelation. Abel has been overseeing a major portion of Berkshire's sprawling empire, including energy, railroad and retail. Buffett revealed previously that Abel's taken on most of the responsibilities at Berkshire. Still, some questions remain as to who will be helping allocate capital at Berkshire, and the roles of Buffett's investing managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, who is also the CEO of Geico.

But one of the biggest factors to his success has nothing to do with picking the right companies. \"His skill is investing, but his secret is time,\" Morgan Housel wrote in the bestselling business book, \"The Psychology of Money.\" \"That's how compounding works,\" Housel wrote. To that point, 99% of Buffett's net worth was accumulated after he was 65 years old, Housel said during a 2022 interview with CNBC. \"If Buffett retired at age 65, you would have never heard of him,\" Housel said. Today, Buffett's total net worth is estimated at $132 billion. That's up substantially from the $84.5 billion net worth Buffett had at the time Housel's book was published in 2020. Most of that wealth came in Buffett's later years, Housel wrote, with $84.2 billion after he turned 50 and $81.5 billion after he turned 65. Compound interest accumulates not only on the initial amount invested, but also to the interest in previous periods. Buffett has compared it to a snowball rolling down a hill. By the time it gets to the bottom, it is much larger. \"The trick is to have a very long hill, which means starting very young or living … to be very old,\" Buffett said. Everyday investors can easily put the power of compound interest to work. \"Start early — as young as you can — and even if it's just small amounts, just keep doing it,\" said David Rea, president of Salem Investment Counselors in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Buffett himself got an early start, making his first stock purchase at age 11. But after selling the three shares of Cities Service, he saw the stock surge, which served as an early lesson that it's hard to predict when to buy a stock and when to sell it. More from Personal Finance:Advice about 401(k) rollovers is poised for a big change. Here's whyIRS free filing pilot processed more than 140,000 returns, commissioner saysHere's why new home sales inch higher despite 7% mortgage rates People tend to get excited when the market is going up, which prompts them to buy, noted Bradley Klontz, a certified financial planner and behavioral finance expert with Your Mental Wealth Advisors. Then when markets drop, they tend to get scared and sell, which is the opposite of what they should be doing, said Klontz, who is also a member of the CNBC FA Council. The S&P 500 has returned more than 10% per year on average over the past 100 years, Klontz noted. Yet investors who try to time the market won't reap the full benefit of those gains if they're moving in and out of their investments. Individuals are not necessarily to blame; survival instincts will prompt you to follow the crowd. \"We're wired to do it,\" Klontz said. We're also wired to consume today rather than prioritize future gratification. To combat that, it helps to have a specific vision for why you're investing — the freedom you hope to achieve, the car you want to drive and the emotional satisfaction that life will bring you, Klontz said. When you clearly have that goal in mind, take action and set up automated movements of your money, say from your paycheck to your 401(k) plan, he recommended. Like Buffett, individuals will also reap the most rewards if they start young. \"It's actually pretty easy to become a millionaire if you're starting early,\" Klontz said. But the longer you wait, the harder it is to catch up. For example, the $5 a day you would need to accumulate $1 million when you're just starting out may turn into $500 a month at age 30, he said. The good news is that an investment strategy does not need to be complicated. Buffett himself has recommended individuals keep it simple with a low-cost S&P 500 index fund. \"If you buy an S&P 500, index fund, week in and week out, you will compound to a large amount of money,\" Rea said. Investors can also take other cues from Buffett — don't panic; buy American; and keep investing through good and bad, Rea said. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

    "published_at": "2024-05-03T11:32:19Z",
    "content": "According to an article by Gregory Zuckerman for The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Warren Buffett, known for his cautious investment style, made a surprising pivot in 2016 when Berkshire Hathaway began accumulating shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). Historically, Buffett and his partner Charlie Munger had steered clear of tech stocks, with Munger even describing Apple as “un-Berkshirelike” in a 2013 Reuters interview. This deviation from their typical investment philosophy marked a significant turn, especially given Buffett’s earlier skepticism about the tech giant’s stock potential. Per the WSJ report, Buffett’s initial reluctance was transformed as he began to view Apple more as a consumer goods company with considerable pricing power due to strong brand loyalty. This shift in perception, catalyzed by high customer retention rates and the addictive quality of Apple products, prompted a large-scale investment in the company. Starting with an initial purchase of nearly 10 million shares in 2016, Berkshire Hathaway substantially increased its Apple stake over the next two years, investing approximately $36 billion. By the end of 2018, Apple constituted about a quarter of Berkshire’s investment portfolio, making it one of Buffett’s most significant single investments. The Wall Street Journal reports that this investment has been immensely profitable for Berkshire, with its Apple stake now valued at about $157 billion, despite recent declines in Apple’s stock price.  Berkshire Hathaway has realized approximately $120 billion in gains, a testament to the extraordinary success of this investment, which outperformed the S&P 500 by a significant margin during the same period. However, current circumstances have introduced new challenges for Apple, as highlighted by the WSJ. The tech giant faces regulatory scrutiny, slowing growth in China, and increasing competition in the tech industry, particularly in artificial intelligence. These factors contribute to the heightened risk profile of Apple’s stock, which has already seen a 6.79% drop this year. As Warren Buffett contemplates the future leadership of Berkshire Hathaway, the management of this enormous stake in Apple remains a critical issue. Despite some reduction in their holdings, Berkshire still holds a substantial portion of Apple shares. The decision to maintain such a large investment in Apple reflects Buffett’s confidence in the long-term value of the company, despite its current challenges and the broader tech industry’s dynamic nature. Yesterday, Apple announced financial results for its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended March 30, 2024). Apple announced an all-time high revenue of $90.8 billion. According to Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, this outcome includes a revenue record in the company’s Services segment. The quarter was notably marked by the launch of the Apple Vision Pro, showcasing the extensive possibilities of spatial computing. Looking ahead, Apple anticipates unveiling another major product next week (rumored to be a new iPad Pro), with further excitement building towards the Worldwide Developers Conference scheduled for the following month. Cook emphasized the company’s commitment to excellence in product and service offerings, aligning with Apple’s foundational values. Apple said its sustained success is reflected in unprecedented levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, contributing to a record-high active installed base across all product categories and geographic areas. This performance has led to a new earnings per share (EPS) record for the March quarter, as stated by Apple’s CFO, Luca Maestri.  The board has approved an increase in the quarterly dividend for the twelfth consecutive year, now at $0.25 per share, marking a 4 percent increase. This dividend is set to be distributed on May 16, 2024, to shareholders recorded by the close of business on May 13, 2024. Additionally, the board has authorized a substantial new share repurchase program, committing an additional $110 billion to buy back Apple’s common stock. Apple says these decisions underscore the board’s confidence in the continued value and future growth potential of Apple, aiming to further reward its shareholders amidst ongoing financial success. In pre-market trading, AAPL is currently (as of 11:25 a.m. UTC on May 3) at $183.79, up $10.76 (6.22%). Since hardware sales were disappointing, the only explanation for the pop in the share price is the $110 billion share buyback program. According to a report by CNBC, “overall sales fell 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% year over year during the quarter, which Apple attributed to a tough comparison versus last year.”   If Apple does not do anything impressive with AI or find a way to increase its sales growth at some point this year, it is possible that Buffett’s patience with Apple will run out.

Las acciones de Apple saltaron hasta 6% tras reportar sus resultados del primer trimestre. A medida que pasan las horas, ha recortado su avance, pero sigue impulsando al Nasdaq y al S&P500, junto a acciones tecnológicas en Asia. La empresa reportó una caída en la venta de sus iPhones y una desaceleración de su negocio en China. Sin embargo Apple, las cifras fueron menos dramáticas a las que esperaba el mercado. No sólo eso, Apple se mostró optimista para su negocio para lo que queda del año. El factor detrás del alza de los papeles, sin embargo, es el anuncio de un plan de recompra de acciones por US$ 110.000 millones y un dividendo de 4%.  El impulso de Apple se extiende a otras acciones tecnológicas en Asia y Europa. En Asia, el Hang Seng extiende su rally con un alza por 1,48%. En Europa, los bancos francceses también capturan titulares. Société Générale y Crédit Agricole ven subir sus acciones 3% y 4%, respectivamente, tras reportar cifras por encima de lo esperado para el primer trimestre gracias al buen desempeño de sus bancas de inversión. La sesión en general mantiene un sesgo al alza, mientras los inversionistas esperan nuevos datos de EEUU. Se espera que el reporte laboral de abril muestre una moderación en contrataciones no agrícolas, con una creación de 243.000 empleos tras los sorpresivos 303.000 registrados en marzo. Muy importante, analistas también querrán ver una desaceleración en el ingreso medio por hora. Una expansión del índice PMI de servicios, que también se publica hoy, podría fortalecer la idea de una economía estadounidense que no permite espacios para un recorte de tasas de parte de la Fed. Hay que poner atención a lo que parece perfilarse como una batalla por Anglo American. Las acciones de la mineras suben 3,16%, tras reportes de que Glencore estaría estudiando presentar una oferta. Mientras, todavía se espera que BHP defina si mejorará su oferta para quedarse con los activos, principalmente de cobre, de Anglo.

    "content": "It's getting easier to track down a Blizzard in Beijing. Dairy Queen opened 450 new locations around the world last year — and 300 of them were in China. \"China continues to be our fastest-growing market,\" said Troy Bader, CEO of Bloomington-based International Dairy Queen. \"International plays a really, really important part of our future.\" Dairy Queen restaurants reported $6.4 billion in sales last year. Since 2019, sales are up 36%, Bader said, and global growth played a big role in that. More than a third of Dairy Queen's nearly 7,500 locations are now located outside the U.S. and Canada. \"Our international growth is where we're seeing our greatest opportunities — our presence isn't as mature,\" Bader said. China is a huge market for American fast-food chains, where KFC and McDonald's are the dominant players. However, local brands are starting to catch up. \"Initially considered a luxury item for a select few, fast food has become increasingly accessible and affordable for a broader segment of Chinese consumers as the economy has grown and disposable incomes have risen,\" according to a report by Dezan Shira & Associates, a foreign direct investment consultancy, which pegs the Chinese fast-food market at more than $500 billion. Dairy Queen is focusing on Southeast Asia broadly; the brand already has about 500 locations in Thailand and a presence in other nearby countries like Vietnam and the Philippines. \"We have supply chains established, we have brand recognition,\" Bader said. \"We are looking at new markets, but that is one area we continue to focus on.\" Mexico has also taken to soft serve, where there are nearly 325 Dairy Queen locations. The chain operates in 20 countries. Internationally, Dairy Queen is known more for its ice cream treats than its food, though the emphasis is shifting toward the Grill & Chill model more common in the U.S. \"We are still the undisputed treat leader and plan to be,\" Bader said. \"But we also are a very balanced food and treat player.\" Domestically, Dairy Queen is pushing even harder to be known for its hot eats as well as its cool treats. \"We talk about our chicken strips being Blizzard-good,\" Bader said, and a new burger lineup released in 2022 is still performing well. International Dairy Queen had $248 million in revenue last year and a $93 million profit, according to franchise disclosure documents, both improvements from the year before. The company earns royalties paid by franchisees and boasts a roughly 50% operating margin. Like other restaurants, Dairy Queen franchisees have had to increase prices in recent years to deal with higher wages and ingredient costs. Bader said the specific increases are up to individual store owners, though the company provides guidance, especially for maintaining the $7 meal and two-for-$5 promotions. \"We still want to make sure we have everyday value available for our fans,\" Bader said. Dairy Queen, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, will be serving up Dilly Bars at the multinational conglomerate's famed annual meeting this weekend in Omaha. Though a small part of Warren Buffett's business empire since 1998, the 84-year-old ice cream company is well-loved by shareholders, Bader said. \"Dairy Queen is one of their favorites because it has a special place in many people's lives and their hearts.\"  Brooks Johnson is a business reporter covering Minnesota’s food industry, 3M and manufacturing trends. © 2024 StarTribune.

    "description": "Mercedes macht es, Siemens, Apple und Berkshire Hathaway auch: Aktienrückkäufe nehmen zu. Welche Ziele die Unternehmen dabei verfolgen - und was die Folgen für Anleger sind. Von Antje Erhard.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-03T09:47:47Z",
    "content": "Stand: 03.05.2024 13:08 Uhr \nMercedes macht es, Siemens, Apple und Berkshire Hathaway auch: Aktienrückkäufe nehmen zu. Welche Ziele die Unternehmen dabei verfolgen - und was die Folgen für Anleger sind.\n \nImmer mehr Unternehmer nehmen Geld in die Hand, um ihre eigenen Aktien aufzukaufen. Das nennt man an der Börse Aktienrückkauf. Unternehmen haben dafür verschiedene Möglichkeiten: Zum einen der Weg über die Börsen. Wie jeder Marktteilnehmer können Unternehmen dort Aktien kaufen oder verkaufen, auch ihre eigenen. Zum anderen können sie ihren Aktionären ein öffentliches Angebot zum Kauf unterbreiten mit fester Anzahl und festem Preis. \nDie Hauptversammlung muss dem Vorstand dazu das \"Go\" geben. Dazu werden Umfang und Zeitraum des Rückkaufes genau festgelegt. Gesetzlich geregelt ist von vornherein, dass Unternehmen nur maximal zehn Prozent des Grundkapitals zurückerwerben dürfen. \nDie zurückgekauften Aktien kann ein Unternehmen aus dem Verkehr ziehen, also löschen. Eine andere Möglichkeit ist, sie an die Belegschaft auszugeben als eine Art Bonus. Manche Unternehmen nutzen das durchaus zur Motivation. \nAber warum kaufen Unternehmen ihre eigenen Aktien - ein Aktienrückkauf kostet schließlich Geld? Geld, das für Investitionen oder Schuldentilgung dann nicht mehr zur Verfügung steht? \nEs geschehe dann, \"wenn Unternehmen mehr Chancen darin sehen, ins eigene Unternehmen zu investieren, statt weiter in das operative Geschäft oder am Kapitalmarkt anzulegen\", sagt Börsenexperte Andreas Lipkow. Das sei eine gut abzuwägende unternehmerische Entscheidung. \"Und natürlich gibt man den Aktionären mehr Wert.\" \nKurz gesagt: Diese Programme hübschen den Kurs auf - auf legale Art: Wenn eine größere Anzahl Aktien vom Markt verschwindet und die Zahl der handelbaren Aktien sinkt, dann wird das Angebot knapper. Gewinne und Dividenden verteilen sich dann auf weniger Aktien. Das Ergebnis: Der Gewinn pro Aktie steigt, obwohl das Unternehmen nicht mehr verdient haben muss. Der Aktienkurs legt meistens zu. \n08.08.2022\n Konzerne werden in diesem Jahr möglicherweise so viele eigene Aktien erwerben wie noch nie.\n                                    mehr\n \nAktien-Rückkäufe können aber ein Unternehmen auch vor einer Übernahme schützen. Will ein Unternehmen nicht übernommen werden, kann es mit Aktien-Rückkäufen gegenhalten. Dann wird es für den kaufwilligen Konkurrenten schwerer, denn weniger Aktien bedeuten: höhere Preise. \nVor allem die Kurssteigerungen machen sich immer mehr Unternehmen auch hierzulande zunutze: Siemens, SAP und Mercedes sind die größten Rückkäufer. In Deutschland wollen die DAX-Unternehmen in diesem Jahr insgesamt rund 16 Milliarden Euro in Rückkäufe ihrer Aktien stecken, analysierte die Commerzbank kürzlich. Das wäre ein Rekordwert. \nAktionäre profitieren davon kurz- wie langfristig. Schon die Ankündigung eines solchen Programms lässt meistens den Aktienkurs zulegen. Langfristig belegt eine Auswertung des Vermögensverwalters HQ Trust, dass Aktien-Rückkäufe für die Aktionäre ein Vorteil sein können. \n15.04.2024\n Die Gewinne der im Leitindex DAX gelisteten Konzerne sinken, aber die Dividenden steigen auf ein Rekordhoch.\n                                    mehr\n \nDazu analysierte HQ Trust die Entwicklung des weltweit investierenden MSCI All Country World-Index über zehn Jahre: Im Durchschnitt stiegen die nordamerikanischen Aktien im Index in dem Zeitraum jährlich um 13,7 Prozent. 3,5 Prozentpunkte gehen nach Einschätzung von HQ Trust auf das Konto der Rückkäufe - in Europa sogar noch mehr: Obwohl die Kurse im Schnitt 6,8 Prozent jährlich gestiegen waren, haben die Rückkäufe in Europa 26,8 Prozent ausgemacht. \nIn den USA sind Rückkäufe seit Jahren gängige Praxis. Beispiel Apple: Der iPhone-Hersteller kündigte in dieser Woche an, Aktien für 110 Milliarden US-Dollar zu kaufen. Zum Vergleich: Im vergangenen Jahr hatte er für 78 Milliarden US-Dollar eigene Anteile vom Markt genommen, 2022 im Volumen von 90 Milliarden - und das in Zeiten, in denen die iPhone-Nachfrage sinkt und der wichtige chinesische Markt schwieriger geworden ist. Auch Groß-Investor Warren Buffett steckt immer wieder Milliarden in eigene Aktien. \n17.02.2021\n Warren Buffett hat in großem Stil Anteile an Telekomfirmen und dem Ölkonzern Chevron gekauft.\n                                    mehr\n \nNicht nur wenn es geschäftlich schwieriger läuft - grundsätzlich gibt es an Aktien-Rückkäufen Kritik: Einfallslos sei es, eigene Aktien zurückzukaufen; nur den Aktionären verpflichtet. Investitionen in das Geschäft wären sinnvoller. In schwierigen Zeiten halte man besser sein Geld zusammen. \nWährend in Deutschland die Rückkauf-Mentalität in den letzten Jahren zunimmt, rudern die USA aktuell etwas zurück. Im vergangenen Jahr haben US-Unternehmen für rund 773 Milliarden Dollar eigene Aktien gekauft. Allerdings waren das 17 Prozent weniger als im Vorjahr, das ergab eine Studie des Vermögensverwalters Janus Henderson. \n\nhintergrund\n\n12.04.2024\n Der \"Weltindex\" MSCI World ist bei vielen Fondssparern auch in Deutschland beliebt. Doch wie riskant ist er?\n                                    mehr\n \nDie Investmentbank Goldman Sachs prognostiziert allerdings für das kommende Jahr, dass die Rückkäufe einen Rekord erreichen, weil vor allem die Technologie-Unternehmen sich an den Programmen beteiligen: \"Das Gewinnwachstum ist der wichtigste Antrieb für Aktienrückkäufe\", erklärte Goldman Sachs im März in einer Studie und untermauerte das mit Zahlen: Erstmals soll die Billionen-Dollar-Grenze für Aktienrückkäufe der Unternehmen des S&P 500 Aktienindex fallen. \nNeben den Aussichten auf steigende Gewinne könnten die möglicherweise sinkenden Zinsen Unternehmen animieren, mehr Geld für Rückkäufe auszugeben.

    "content": "Adolfo Reséndiz   Periodista por la Escuela de Periodismo Carlos Septién García. Técnico mecánico automotriz CEDVA. Me gusta el rap, comer asado argentino y los fines de semana largos. Tesla ha vuelto a tomar el centro del escenario en el mundo de los autos eléctricos, recuperando su posición como líder mundial en ventas después de superar a su competidor chino BYD en el primer trimestre de 2024. Con 386,810 vehículos eléctricos vendidos en los primeros tres meses del año, Tesla ha logrado un hito significativo a pesar de una disminución del 20.2% respecto al último trimestre de 2023 y del 8.5% en comparación con el mismo trimestre del año pasado. BYD, por su parte, reportó ventas de 300,114 vehículos eléctricos en el mismo período, un aumento del 13.4% respecto al año anterior, pero muy por debajo de su récord de 526,409 unidades en el último trimestre de 2023. La compañía, respaldada por Berkshire Hathaway del veterano inversor estadounidense Warren Buffett, ha optado por reducir los precios de algunos de sus últimos modelos en un intento por atraer compradores más cautelosos frente a artículos costosos como los automóviles. Además, para contrarrestar la disminución de la demanda en China, BYD ha estado explorando nuevas oportunidades de expansión en otros mercados según informa la BBC. La caída en las ventas tanto de Tesla como de BYD se atribuye a una competencia creciente y a una demanda más débil en todo el mundo, especialmente en China. A esto se suma la eliminación de las ayudas públicas a la compra de vehículos eléctricos en Alemania o Noruega y la preferencia de los consumidores por los modelos híbridos. A pesar de estos desafíos, Elon Musk, CEO de Tesla, se mantiene optimista sobre el futuro de la compañía, destacando el potencial de crecimiento en el mercado de vehículos eléctricos y anunciando planes para acelerar el lanzamiento de nuevos modelos, incluido un vehículo más asequible y un robotaxi. La reciente visita de Musk a China y la eliminación de las restricciones a los autos de Tesla para cumplir con los requisitos de seguridad de datos del país son señales alentadoras para la compañía, que espera expandir su presencia en el mercado automotriz más grande del mundo. Aunque Tesla enfrenta desafíos por delante, como la competencia feroz y la necesidad de mantener la innovación, su capacidad para recuperar el trono mundial de los autos eléctricos demuestra su resiliencia y su posición como líder en la industria automotriz del futuro.

    "published_at": "2024-05-03T01:50:17Z",
    "content": "Everyone knows Warren Buffett ‘s successor won’t be able to match the legendary investor, but Berkshire Hathaway ‘s board remains confident Greg Abel is the right guy to one day lead the conglomerate into the future. Longtime Berkshire board member Ron Olson told investors gathered Thursday at a conference two days ahead of the company’s annual shareholders meeting that Abel understands all the fundamental principles that guided Buffett, like letting Berkshire’s companies largely run themselves. And Abel will be committed to running Berkshire in a conservative way that will protect the company that’s known for it financial strength, he said. “Greg is not somebody who is going to be as likely to create the kind of following in the press that I think Warren has had,” Olson said. “On the other hand. I have every reason to believe that he will run the companies that we have the responsibility for in the same way that Warren ran them.” Olson said he’s confident business owners will still be willing to sell their companies to Berkshire once the Canadian utility executive takes over after the 93-year-old Buffett is gone. Olson said he doesn’t think last year’s public legal fight with the billionaire Haslam family over how much Berkshire would ultimately pay for the last 20% of the Pilot truck stop chain the family agreed to sell to Buffett will be a deterrent to future deals either. Both the Haslams and Berkshire accused each other of trying to manipulate Pilot’s earnings to affect the final $2.6 billion price. Business owners considering selling can see all the positive and respectful relationships Berkshire has with its dozens of other subsidiaries on display in the 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall adjoining the arena where Saturday’s meeting will be held, Olson said. In fact the legal battle gave Olson, who is a partner at Berkshire’s primary law firm, the chance to work closely with Abel, giving him even more confidence in the board’s chosen successor. “I could tell you that his preparation and thinking was impressive. He is strategic in his thinking. And he is decisive in his judgement,” Olson said. Plus, Berkshire is sitting on more than $167 billion cash, so it has ample resources to do deals and, Olson said, “people generally like to be paid in cash.” Abel, who keeps a low profile and doesn’t typically grant interviews, will be answering questions alongside Buffett for hours Saturday, trying to help fill the role Buffett’s longtime partner Charlie Munger held for decades before he died last fall. Abel has been overseeing all of Berkshire’s varied non-insurance businesses for several years while another vice chairman, Ajit Jain, oversees the insurance businesses, including Geico and General Reinsurance. Olson said Abel is a numbers guy who can dissect a business’ balance sheet as quickly and well as Buffett, and he’s also a great listener that people like to work with. But, Olson said, “Greg is not going to be as entertaining as Warren and Charlie have been through the years.” So Munger’s absence will be felt acutely on Saturday by all the thousands of people attending the meeting. There simply is no way to replace the expertise, advice and friendship Munger offered to Buffett for more than six decades. Professor Lawrence Cunningham, who has written several books about Berkshire, said he thinks even with the profound loss of Munger the company he helped build will endure. “The chair is empty. There’s no way to fill it. But I’m also confident that Warren — and especially Greg and Ajit — will carry on the torch,” Cunningham said. Berkshire has been grappling with succession questions for decades, but Cunningham said he thinks Buffett and Munger built an organization bigger than themselves that will endure. Olson said Berkshire’s board knows there just isn’t another Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger out there to replace those two men. After Buffett dies, Berkshire will face pressure as the shareholder base evolves to include more index and activist investors. One of the things investors may demand is that Berkshire change its longstanding policy and start paying a dividend if it can’t find a good use for all that cash. Olson said the board hasn’t ruled out paying a dividend at some point in the future, but it also hasn’t seriously considering approving one now with Buffett still at the helm. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

    "content": "OMAHA, Neb.  — Everyone knows Warren Buffett 's successor won't be able to match the legendary investor, but Berkshire Hathaway 's board remains confident Greg Abel is the right guy to one day lead the conglomerate into the future. Longtime Berkshire board member Ron Olson told investors gathered Thursday at a conference two days ahead of the company's annual shareholders meeting that Abel understands all the fundamental principles that guided Buffett, like letting Berkshire's companies largely run themselves. And Abel will be committed to running Berkshire in a conservative way that will protect the company that's known for it financial strength, he said. ''Greg is not somebody who is going to be as likely to create the kind of following in the press that I think Warren has had,'' Olson said. ''On the other hand. I have every reason to believe that he will run the companies that we have the responsibility for in the same way that Warren ran them.'' Olson said he's confident business owners will still be willing to sell their companies to Berkshire once the Canadian utility executive takes over after the 93-year-old Buffett is gone. Olson said he doesn't think last year's public legal fight with the billionaire Haslam family over how much Berkshire would ultimately pay for the last 20% of the Pilot truck stop chain the family agreed to sell to Buffett will be a deterrent to future deals either. Both the Haslams and Berkshire accused each other of trying to manipulate Pilot's earnings to affect the final $2.6 billion price. Business owners considering selling can see all the positive and respectful relationships Berkshire has with its dozens of other subsidiaries on display in the 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall adjoining the arena where Saturday's meeting will be held, Olson said. In fact the legal battle gave Olson, who is a partner at Berkshire's primary law firm, the chance to work closely with Abel, giving him even more confidence in the board's chosen successor. ''I could tell you that his preparation and thinking was impressive. He is strategic in his thinking. And he is decisive in his judgement,'' Olson said. Plus, Berkshire is sitting on more than $167 billion cash, so it has ample resources to do deals and, Olson said, ''people generally like to be paid in cash.'' Abel, who keeps a low profile and doesn't typically grant interviews, will be answering questions alongside Buffett for hours Saturday, trying to help fill the role Buffett's longtime partner Charlie Munger held for decades before he died last fall. Abel has been overseeing all of Berkshire's varied non-insurance businesses for several years while another vice chairman, Ajit Jain, oversees the insurance businesses, including Geico and General Reinsurance. Olson said Abel is a numbers guy who can dissect a business' balance sheet as quickly and well as Buffett, and he's also a great listener that people like to work with. But, Olson said, ''Greg is not going to be as entertaining as Warren and Charlie have been through the years.'' So Munger's absence will be felt acutely on Saturday by all the thousands of people attending the meeting. There simply is no way to replace the expertise, advice and friendship Munger offered to Buffett for more than six decades. Professor Lawrence Cunningham, who has written several books about Berkshire, said he thinks even with the profound loss of Munger the company he helped build will endure. ''The chair is empty. There's no way to fill it. But I'm also confident that Warren — and especially Greg and Ajit — will carry on the torch,'' Cunningham said. Berkshire has been grappling with succession questions for decades, but Cunningham said he thinks Buffett and Munger built an organization bigger than themselves that will endure. Olson said Berkshire's board knows there just isn't another Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger out there to replace those two men.

    "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\tBy Dade Hayes  Business Editor \nWarren Buffett says he has sold all of his shares in Paramount Global at a significant loss. \n\tSpeaking at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway, his company, today in Omaha, NE, the billionaire investor took full ownership of the bad call. Despite speculation to the contrary, he said, “It was 100% my decision” to invest in Paramount in 2022. “We sold it all and we lost quite a bit of money. That happens in this business.” (Watch a clip of him above.) \n\tAs of the end of 2023, Berkshire owned 63.3 million Class B, or non-voting shares, which had a value of about $800 million at the time. The stake, which represented about 10.1% of the company’s equity, helped boost the stock when Buffett initially invested in 2022. He then went on to make public comments criticizing the companies pursuing Netflix in subscription streaming, a cohort that includes Paramount, given the economics of the emerging sector. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNews\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPeter Bart: Paramount Yearns For \"Seamless Transition\" But Past Studio Takeovers Have Been Costly And Chaotic\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNews\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNexstar CEO On CBS Stations - Can't Buy Them Under Current Regulatory Regime \"But If That Were To Change, Maybe Our Opinion Would Change\"  \t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Buffett has made plenty of missteps over his decades of investing. Owning Paramount stock, Buffett mused, “made me think even further … harder, even, about the whole question of what people do with their leisure time and what the governing principles are of running an entertainment business of any sort.” He dryly added, “I think I’m smarter than I was a year or two years ago. But I also think I’m poorer because I acquired the knowledge in the manner I did. \n\n \n\tClass B shareholders in Paramount have recently been up in arms about the company’s merger negotiations with Skydance Media due to fears of dilution. Shari Redstone controls almost 80% of the voting, or Class A, shares in the company and had favored a two-step, all-stock deal with Skydance. An exclusive negotiating window between the companies expired at midnight Friday and a special committee of the board of directors met today to consider an alternative, all-cash merger proposal from Sony Pictures Entertainment and private equity giant Apollo. That deal has a preliminary pricetag of $26 billion and would likely see all shareholders paid a premium. \n\tWall Street has generally approved of the Sony/Apollo deal, but Redstone has been more reluctant to embrace it because it would likely entail the breakup of the company and the combination of Paramount’s film studio with Sony’s. Redstone’s father, Sumner Redstone, regarded Paramount Pictures, which he acquired after a fierce battle with Barry Diller, as the centerpiece of his media empire.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy.

    "content": "Shareholder proposals are usually uneventful at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting, but Warren Buffett and the company are now facing a lawsuit over the way one presenter was treated last year OMAHA, Neb. -- Shareholder proposals are usually uneventful at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting. But Warren Buffett and the company are now facing a lawsuit over the way one presenter was treated last year. Peter Flaherty with the National Legal and Policy Center came back with another proposal this year on a different subject even after he was cut off in the middle of his presentation last year and arrested for trespassing. The charges were later dropped, but Flaherty decided to sue because of the way he was treated to stand up for any shareholder who wants to bring a proposal. He said he had never had trouble at dozens of meetings he has presented at since 2005, including Berkshire’s 2022 meeting. “I’ve never been interrupted while making a shareholder presentation. I’ve never had my mic cut, and I’ve never been removed from a meeting room. And I’ve certainly never been arrested,” Flaherty said, “Those things were unprecedented for me.” The issue last year was that Flaherty questioned the character of one of Buffett's best friends and a former Berkshire board member, Bill Gates. Flaherty suggested that Buffett's close association with Gates could hurt Berkshire's reputation because of reports that Gates had been associated with Jeffrey Epstein before he was arrested for sex trafficking. So he was proposing that Berkshire give someone else Buffett's chairman title while leaving him as CEO. Buffett has donated billions to Gates’ foundation over the years and plans to give him the bulk of his fortune to distribute. Berkshire didn't immediately respond to the federal lawsuit that was filed Friday, and it wasn't mentioned during Saturday's meeting. Berkshire officials didn't even address any of the proposals during the meeting — instead they relied on their statements of opposition that were filed in the official meeting proxy. Buffett stayed silent during the business meeting after spending all day Saturday answering shareholder questions at the main part of the shareholder meeting. He let his eventual successor Vice Chairman Greg Abel take the lead. He only reminded the presenters of all six proposals to keep their comments related to the proposals. Flaherty’s proposal was one of six rejected at Berkshire’s meeting this year. They were all opposed by the board, and Buffett still controls roughly one-third of the vote so anything he opposes is almost certain to fail. None of the proposals received more than 85,000 votes. Flaherty’s proposal only drew 6,150 votes while getting 443,544 votes against it. Some of the other proposals rejected Saturday included ones to require Berkshire to create reports on climate change risks and diversity and inclusion efforts at the massive conglomerate. Another proposal would have required Berkshire to create a board committee focused on railroad safety. The safety chief for the SMART-TD rail union that represents conductors and other rail workers, Jared Cassity, said that if BNSF wants to argue that safety is the railroad's top priority, Berkshire's board should focus on it and review staffing and operational practices to help prevent derailments like the disastrous one Norfolk Southern had last year in East Palestine, Ohio. “Railroad safety requires effective board oversight,” Cassity said. Berkshire argued that BNSF is already focused on improving safety and doesn't need more oversight. With regard to the other proposals, Berkshire officials argued that such reports would be cumbersome because of the decentralized way the company is run and unnecessary. Plus, some of its subsidiaries like its massive utility unit already produce reports on greenhouse gas emissions, Berkshire said. This year, Flaherty was allowed to make his case that Berkshire should produce a report on the risks of doing business in China, before the proposal was summarily rejected. “China poses unique risks for Berkshire Hathaway,” Flaherty said, arguing that the company's existing disclosures about subsidiaries like Fruit of the Loom that have factories in China are inadequate. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

    "content": "Fund next-gen business journalism with $10 a month Search Free Newsletters Even Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, known as the Oracle of Omaha, can’t actually see into the future. And when it came to the conglomerate’s stake in Paramount Global, that cost Berkshire some money. During a question-and-answer session at Berkshire’s annual shareholder conference on Saturday, Buffett revealed that the company dumped all of its remaining shares of Paramount, the parent company of CBS, MTV, and Paramount Pictures. And it did so at a loss. As of Dec. 31, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire held 63 million shares of Paramount valued at  $816 million, according to a February Securities and Exchange Commission filing.  “I was 100% responsible for the Paramount decision,” Buffett said. “It was 100% my decision, and we’ve sold it all and we lost quite a bit of money.” Buffett said Berkshire’s involvement with Paramount made him think deeper about what people do with their leisure time and “what the governing principles are of running an entertainment business of any sort,” from sports to movies. “I think I’m smarter now than I was a couple years ago, but I also think I’m poorer,” he added. Berkshire first acquired a nonvoting stake of Paramount class B shares in early 2022. Paramount stock has fallen almost 13% year-to-date, and more than 21% year-over-year. The company has been the target of several potential takeover bids as its business struggles. On Friday, much-criticized merger talks between Paramount and SkyDance Media, the film production company led by David Ellison, ended after Paramount decided not to extend negotiations. Skydance — the film company behind big-name movies like Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One — had proposed to pay more than $2 billion for National Amusements, Paramount’s parent company, and to have Ellison lead the newly-formed company. The end of merger talks with Skydance came just after Sony Pictures and Apollo Global Management made a $26 billion all-cash offer to buy Paramount. In another shakeup last Monday, Paramount CEO Bob Bakish announced that he would step down from the role.

But Warren Buffett and the company are now facing a lawsuit over the way one presenter was treated last year. Peter Flaherty with the National Legal and Policy Center came back with another proposal this year on a different subject even after he was cut off in the middle of his presentation last year and arrested for trespassing. The charges were later dropped, but Flaherty decided to sue because of the way he was treated to stand up for any shareholder who wants to bring a proposal. He said he had never had trouble at dozens of meetings he has presented at since 2005, including Berkshire’s 2022 meeting. “I’ve never been interrupted while making a shareholder presentation. I’ve never had my mic cut, and I’ve never been removed from a meeting room. And I’ve certainly never been arrested,” Flaherty said, “Those things were unprecedented for me.” The issue last year was that Flaherty questioned the character of one of Buffett's best friends and a former Berkshire board member, Bill Gates. Flaherty suggested that Buffett's close association with Gates could hurt Berkshire's reputation because of reports that Gates had been associated with Jeffrey Epstein before he was arrested for sex trafficking. So he was proposing that Berkshire give someone else Buffett's chairman title while leaving him as CEO. Buffett has donated billions to Gates’ foundation over the years and plans to give him the bulk of his fortune to distribute. Berkshire didn't immediately respond to the federal lawsuit that was filed Friday, and it wasn't mentioned during Saturday's meeting. Berkshire officials didn't even address any of the proposals during the meeting — instead they relied on their statements of opposition that were filed in the official meeting proxy. Buffett stayed silent during the business meeting after spending all day Saturday answering shareholder questions at the main part of the shareholder meeting. He let his eventual successor Vice Chairman Greg Abel take the lead. He only reminded the presenters of all six proposals to keep their comments related to the proposals. Flaherty’s proposal was one of six rejected at Berkshire’s meeting this year. They were all opposed by the board, and Buffett still controls roughly one-third of the vote so anything he opposes is almost certain to fail. None of the proposals received more than 85,000 votes. Flaherty’s proposal only drew 6,150 votes while getting 443,544 votes against it. Some of the other proposals rejected Saturday included ones to require Berkshire to create reports on climate change risks and diversity and inclusion efforts at the massive conglomerate. Another proposal would have required Berkshire to create a board committee focused on railroad safety. The safety chief for the SMART-TD rail union that represents conductors and other rail workers, Jared Cassity, said that if BNSF wants to argue that safety is the railroad's top priority, Berkshire's board should focus on it and review staffing and operational practices to help prevent derailments like the disastrous one Norfolk Southern had last year in East Palestine, Ohio. “Railroad safety requires effective board oversight,” Cassity said. Berkshire argued that BNSF is already focused on improving safety and doesn't need more oversight. With regard to the other proposals, Berkshire officials argued that such reports would be cumbersome because of the decentralized way the company is run and unnecessary. Plus, some of its subsidiaries like its massive utility unit already produce reports on greenhouse gas emissions, Berkshire said. This year, Flaherty was allowed to make his case that Berkshire should produce a report on the risks of doing business in China, before the proposal was summarily rejected. “China poses unique risks for Berkshire Hathaway,” Flaherty said, arguing that the company's existing disclosures about subsidiaries like Fruit of the Loom that have factories in China are inadequate. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

    "content": "“It was 100% my decision,” the CEO said during the company’s annual meeting on Saturday As Paramount comes off a rocky week in which the company lost its CEO and its exclusive merger talks window with Skydance came to an end without a deal, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett says his company has now sold its entire stake in Paramount. Berkshire Hathaway had previously sold a third of its stock in Paramount during the fourth quarter of last year. “We sold it all, and we lost quite a bit of money, that happens in this business too,” Buffett said on Saturday at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. He added that he was “100% responsible” for the Paramount decision — both buying in and getting out. According to the company’s latest available filings, Berkshire owned 63.3 million shares of Paramount Global at the end of 2023. The company disclosed a $2.6 billion stake in Paramount in 2022 and picked up even more shares after that, but now they’re out. “Owning Paramount made me think even deeper, but I certainly looked harder about the whole question of what people do with their leisure time and what the governing principles are of running an entertainment business of any sort, whether it’s sports or movies or whatever it might be,” Buffett said at the meeting. “I think I’m smarter now than I was a couple years ago, but I also think I’m poorer because I acquired the knowledge in the matter I did.” On Friday, after a month of exclusive talks between Paramount and Skydance, their negotiation window expired without a deal, signaling one is unlikely to happen. David Ellison’s Skydance submitted a revised offer earlier this week in an effort to assuage concerns that the deal benefits non-executive chairwoman Shari Redstone over other investors. Notable investors have warned they could pursue litigation if the Skydance deal or any other bid does not adequately benefit shareholders. Ahead of the window closing and moments before the company reported its Q1 earnings, Paramount CEO Bob Bakish was ousted and replaced with a trio of executives to form an “Office of the CEO” — CBS CEO and president George Cheeks, Paramount Media Networks CEO and president Chris McCarthy and Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon CEO and president Brian Robbins. Sony Pictures Entertainment and Apollo Global Management have also submitted a non-binding, joint $26 billion all-cash offer for Paramount. That deal would see Sony take a majority stake and operational control, while Apollo would have a minority stake. But such a deal would likely face regulatory scrutiny due to limitations surrounding foreign ownership. For now, Paramount is going it alone.  Your email address will not be published.

Buffett disclosed the news during Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday.\n\n \n\t“We sold it all, and we lost quite a bit of money, that happens in this business too,” Buffett told the crowd, adding that he was the one who decided to buy into the company in the first place (there had been speculation that one of Buffett’s deputies may have initiated the trade). “I did it all by myself, folks.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParamount Expected to Part Ways With CEO Bob Bakish Amid Deal Talks\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'The Smurfs Movie' Sets Starry Cast to Join Rihanna; Dave Bautista, Eric Nam Board 'Airbender' Franchise\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tBerkshire surprised Wall Street when it disclosed a $2.6 billion stake in Paramount in May 2022. Later that year, it added even more shares, ultimately becoming the largest shareholder in the company (or at least its non-voting shares, with Shari Redstone and the Redstone family’s National Amusements controlling a majority of its voting shares). \n\tSince then, of course, Paramount has been on a stock downswing, as the exorbitant costs to compete in the streaming wars and a seemingly tepid M&A market, have put the company in a difficult financial position. Paramount also slashed its dividend last year so that it could invest in streaming.\n\n \n\tIn recent months the company has been embroiled in sale talks, with an exclusive negotiating window with a consortium led by David Ellison’s Skydance having just ended, and a new proposal from Apollo and Sony on the table. While the stock price had picked up slightly given the talks, it has been wobbly given the uncertainty over whether a deal would get done, and what would happen if it doesn’t. \n\tThe company also parted ways with its CEO, Bob Bakish, last week, replacing him with a trio of executives forming an “office of the CEO.” \n\tAt Berkshire’s shareholder meeting last year in Omaha, Buffett quipped that “it’s not good news when any company cuts its dividend dramatically,” and added comments that seemed skeptical of the streaming business. \n\t“You’ve got a bunch of companies that don’t want to quit. Who knows what pricing does under that?” Buffett said. \n\tAt Saturday’s meeting, Buffett said that the experience taught him, at 93 years old, a lesson. \n\t“Actually, owning Paramount made me think even deeper, but I certainly looked harder about the whole question of what people do with their leisure time and what the governing principles are of running an entertainment business of any sort, whether it’s sports or movies or whatever it might be,” Buffett said. “I think I’m smarter now than I was a couple years ago, but I also think I’m poorer because I acquired the knowledge in the manner I did.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tBerkshire disclosed in February that it began selling its stake in Paramount at the end of last year.

    "published_at": "2024-05-04T21:22:59Z",
    "content": " Related Stories Every year, tens of thousands of investors flock to Omaha — and many more tune in around the world – to watch Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett field questions from shareholders at his company's annual meeting. This year, as ever, Buffett shared his insights not only on the financial fundamentals behind Berkshire's many subsidiaries and portfolio companies, but also the path to a successful life. This year's entire 4-plus-hour affair is worth a watch, listen or read. But without getting into the nitty-gritty, here's two key pieces of advice Buffett shared on Saturday — one about money, and one about life. One shareholder asked Buffett about one of the most fundamental decisions any investor can make: when to buy or sell an investment. The description of the process he and longtime partner Charlie Munger employed offers tremendous insight to his investment philosophy. \"Charlie and I made decisions extremely fast, but in effect after years of thinking about the parameters that would enable us to make the quick decision when it presented itself,\" he said. He didn't make his sizable investment in Apple, he said, until he felt he had a full grasp of consumer behavior, an understanding he came to after owning several other consumer businesses, both successful and unsuccessful. After years of gathering intelligence on a particular subject, he said, \"there is something that comes along and ticks a whole bunch of observations that you've made and knowledge you have, and then crystallizes your thinking into action, big action in the case of Apple.\" The point for investors: Buffett doesn't buy any investment based on vibes or impulse. Only after he determined that the iPhone was \"maybe the greatest product of all time,\" did he buy. Meanwhile, he never worries about missing out on an investment if it involves a product or company that he hasn't devoted exhaustive research to. \"Charlie and I missed a lot of things … we never worried about missing something that we didn't understand,\" Buffett said. Shareholders frequently ask Buffett for his musings on a life well lived, but rarely are they quite as straightforward as one question asker this year: \"What advice would you like to share today that you believe everyone needs to hear?\" she asked. Buffett echoed guidance from Munger: Think about how you would like your obituary to read, and begin building a life that will get you there. Buffett noted that those living in present day America have as good a chance at accomplishing this as anyone in world history. \"You're entering the best world that's ever existed. And you want to find the people to share it with and the activities to participate in that fit you,\" he said. \"And if you get lucky like Charlie and I did you'll find things that interest you young. But if you don't find them right away you keep looking.\" That may require some trial and error, Buffett acknowledged. \"I always tell students, find a job that you would like to have if you didn't need a job. Sometimes you can find that very early, and sometimes you go through various experiences,\" he said. \"But don't forget what you're actually trying to do.\" Regardless of what tribulations you go through, keeping in mind how you'd like to eventually be remembered is the best way to help you achieve it, Buffett said. \"Expect some difficulties along the way, but if you're thinking that way, you're more likely to get there.\" Want to make extra money outside of your day job? Sign up for CNBC's new online course How to Earn Passive Income Online to learn about common passive income streams, tips to get started and real-life success stories.

Buffett opined that trimming the company's stake in Apple was in part due to tax reasons after the stock roared in 2023. \"It doesn't bother me in the least to write that check and I would really hope with all that America's done for all of you, it shouldn't bother you that we do it,\" Buffett said. \"And if I'm doing it at 21% this year and we're doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year.\" Buffett also noted he unloaded Berkshire's entire position in Paramount Global — and took full responsibility for the loss. \"It was 100% my decision, and we've sold it all and we lost quite a bit of money,\" Buffett said. The firm owned 63.3 million shares of Paramount at the end of 2023 after slashing the position by roughly one-third in the fourth quarter of last year. Here are some of the best quotes from Buffett on some of Berkshire's top holdings.  Buffett said Apple and Coca-Cola will remain premier holdings in Berkshire's portfolio. \"That's the story of why we own American Express, which is a wonderful business. We own Coca-Cola, which is a wonderful business,\" Buffett said. \"And we own Apple, which is an even better business, and we will own, unless something really extraordinary happens, we will own Apple and American Express and Coca-Cola.\" The \"Oracle of Omaha\" highlighted credit card firm American Express as another favorite, noting the company's growing position in the consumer credit sector. \"I can't really think of a company like American Express that has a position and a credit card that is extremely strong,\" Buffett said. \"It has strengthened dramatically over the last 20 years for a lot of reasons.\" Buffett credited longtime partner Charlie Munger, who died in November, for his call to buy both Chinese manufacturing company BYD and wholesale retailer Costco — but wished he took a larger stake in Costco. Berkshire no longer owns a position in Costco. \"Charlie, twice, pounded the table with me and said 'buy, buy, buy' and BYD was one of them and Costco was the other. We bought a certain amount of Costco and bought quite a bit of BYD, but looking back, he already wasn't as aggressive, but I should have been more aggressive in Costco,\" Buffett said. \"It wasn't fatal that we weren't but [Munger] was right big-time in both companies.\" Buffett told Berkshire investors on Saturday that the company's cash stake hoard could climb to $200 billion by the end of the current quarter. \"I don't mind at all under current conditions building the cash position. When I look at what's available in equity markets and the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive,\" the investor said. \"Our cash and Treasury bills were $182 billion at the quarter end, and I think it's a fair assumption that they'll probably be at about $200 billion at the end of this quarter.\" Got a confidential news tip?

    "content": "В первом квартале 2024 года Berkshire Hathaway Уоррена Баффета снова сократила инвестиции в Apple. Рыночная стоимость акций бигтеха в портфеле упала до $135,4 млрд, следует из формы 10-Q, содержащей данные за первый квартал 2024 года. По подсчетам CNBC, это соответствует примерно 790 млн акций, тогда как на конец четвертого квартала 2023 года их было 905,56 млн. Иными словами, пакет Apple, которым владеет конгломерат, в первом квартале сократился почти на 13%. Berkshire Hathaway избавляется от акций Apple второй квартал подряд. В четвертом квартале конгломерат продал чуть более 10 млн акций Apple, или около 1% пакета. С одной стороны, есть мнение, что таким образом Баффет фиксирует прибыль. По итогам 2023 года котировки Apple выросли почти на 50%, эмитент стал одним из лидеров роста в технологическом секторе. С другой стороны, в этом году настроения в отношении Apple не столь оптимистичные — котировки компании с начала января упали на 4,75%. Несколько недель назад просадка была еще больше, но потери сократились после недавнего отчета за первый квартал и решения Apple провести обратный выкуп на $110 млрд — самый крупный за всю историю рынка США. Тем не менее по итогам первого квартала бигтех зафиксировал снижение выручки и прибыли, притом что форвардное значение мультипликатора P/E превышает 27х. Всего на конец первого квартала около 75% инвестиционного портфеля Berkshire Hathaway занимали акции пяти компаний: Bank of America — $39,2 млрд; American Express — $34,5 млрд; Coca-Cola — $24,5 млрд; Chevron — $19,4 млрд. Важным маркером состояния Berkshire Hathaway является операционная прибыль, поскольку помимо портфеля финансовых инвестиций конгломерат управляет производственными предприятиями, а также компаниями в сфере страхования, коммунальных услуг, энергетики и железнодорожных перевозок. По итогам первого квартала 2024 года этот показатель вырос год к году на 39%, до $11,22 млрд. Это абсолютный рекорд в истории Berkshire, предыдущий был поставлен в третьем квартале 2023 года ($10,76 млрд). Основную часть прироста этого показателя принесли компании, связанные со страхованием. Прибыль данного сегмента подскочила почти в три раза — с $911 млн до $2,6 млрд. Как отмечает Bloomberg, это произошло благодаря улучшению результатов автостраховщика Geico, меньшему количеству катастроф и росту дохода от инвестиций в страхование. Также агентство обратило внимание на предупреждение Баффета, сделанное им год назад, о том, что прибыль большей части подразделений Berkshire упадет в 2023 году из-за того, что «невероятный период» для экономики США подходит к концу. Эти слова были сказаны на годовом собрании акционеров Berkshire Hathaway. Баффет тогда спрогнозировал замедление темпов роста своих компаний на фоне потрясений в банковском секторе США, а также ускорения инфляции и повышения ставок в экономике. Чистая прибыль, которая складывается из операционной прибыли и прибыли по сделкам на фондовом рынке, в первом квартале составила $12,7 млрд против $35,5 млрд годом ранее (-64,2% год к году). Впрочем, Баффет не раз заявлял, что «анализ прибылей или убытков, полученных от инвестиционной деятельности в отдельно взятом квартале, обычно не имеет смысла». Стандарты финансовой отчетности обязывают раскрывать в том числе нереализованные убытки или прибыли от таких сделок. В первом квартале Berkshire Hathaway обновила еще один рекорд — размер денежной подушки на балансе. На конец квартала объем свободного кеша достиг $189 млрд. Предыдущий рекорд был установлен в четвертом квартале 2023 года на уровне $167,64 млрд. В феврале этого года Баффет посетовал на отсутствие значимых сделок, которые позволили бы Berkshire Hathaway добиться «ошеломительных результатов», отмечает Bloomberg. В связи с этим Berkshire Hathway активно проводит обратный выкуп своих акций. В первом квартале текущего года конгломерат потратил на эти цели $2,6 млрд. В субботу, 4 мая, также пройдет годовое общее собрание акционеров Berkshire Hathaway в Омахе. Главная интрига заключается в том, раскроет ли Баффет название загадочного бизнеса, в который Berkshire Hathway инвестировала в прошлом году. В третьем и четвертом кварталах Berkshire Hathaway попросила у Комиссии по ценным бумагам и биржам США (SEC) разрешение не раскрывать информацию об одном или нескольких активах в своем портфеле в целях конфиденциальности. Пока неизвестно, какая конкретно компания заинтересовала Баффета, но аналитики предполагают, что «оракул из Омахи» сделал крупную ставку на финансовый сектор. Конгломерат относительно редко обращается в регулятору с просьбой не раскрывать свои инвестиции. В предыдущий раз так было с Chevron и Verizon, акции которых Berkshire тайно скупала в 2020 году. Среди других ожидаемых тем — вопрос управления и преемственности. «Откровенно говоря, вопрос преемственности является главным вопросом для большинства инвесторов. И это своего рода слон в комнате, учитывая возраст Уоррена Баффета и смерть Чарли Мангера», — отметила старший вице-президент CFRA Research Кэти Зайферт. Не считая пандемии коронавируса, это будет первое собрание Berkshire Hathaway, которое пройдет без Чарли Мангера. Многолетний соратник Уоррена Баффета скончался в ноябре 2023 года в возрасте 99 лет. Мангер и Баффет познакомились в 1959 году, к Berkshire Hathaway будущий вице-председатель компании присоединился в 1978-м."

O evento aconteceu neste sábado (4) em Omaha, Nebraska – terra natal e sede da empresa do bilionário. Ao final da conferência, Buffett se despediu dos participantes em tom bem humorado. Ele disse esperar estar presente na conferência do próximo ano – arrancando risadas do público e aplausos de investidores e acionistas. O InfoMoney fez a cobertura em tempo real com a presença do enviado especial Henrique Esteter, coordenador multiplataforma, com transmissão de live sobre os pontos altos do encontro que reuniu investidores do mundo todo, incluindo um grupo de brasileiros. Assista à live das 18h sobre os pontos altos do encontro. Continua depois da publicidade Veja a seguir algumas das frases proferidas pelo “Oráculo de Omaha” que marcaram sua participação no evento: “Veremos como a próxima gestão jogará o jogo na Berkshire, [mas] felizmente você não terá que esperar muito por isso. Me sinto bem, mas conheço um pouco de tábua atuarial”. “Qualquer pessoa que queira se aposentar aos 65 anos seria desqualificada como potencial CEO da Berkshire” Continua depois da publicidade “Charlie chegou a 99,9 anos. Se eu tivesse mais um dia com Charlie, provavelmente faria a mesma coisa de sempre”. “Quando você pensa sobre o potencial de enganar as pessoas, se você puder reproduzir imagens que nem consigo dizer, que dizem, ‘Preciso de dinheiro’, ‘Acabei de sofrer um acidente de carro, preciso de US$ 50 mil’. Quero dizer, fraudes sempre fizeram parte do cenário americano, mas se eu estivesse interessado em investir em fraudes, fosse a indústria em crescimento de todos os tempos”, afirmou. “Não me incomoda nem um pouco preencher esse cheque – e eu realmente espero que, com tudo o que a América fez por todos vocês, não deveria incomodá-los que façamos isso [sobre o pagamento de mais impostos para as contas públicas dos EUA] – e se eu estiver fazendo isso a 21% este ano e a uma porcentagem um pouco maior mais tarde, não acho que você realmente se importará com o fato de termos vendido um pouco da Apple este ano”. Continua depois da publicidade “Somos donos da Coca-Cola, que é um negócio maravilhoso. E somos donos da Apple, que é um negócio ainda melhor, e seremos donos, a menos que algo realmente extraordinário aconteça, seremos donos da Apple, da American Express e da Coca-Cola.” “A atual estratégia de alocação de capital permanecerá intacta durante os próximos anos: comprar empresas maravilhosas a um preço justo”. “Às vezes, fizemos coisas que foram grandes erros”, disse ele. “Mas nunca chegamos perto de erros fatais.” Continua depois da publicidade “Nosso caixa e títulos do Tesouro eram de US$ 182 bilhões no final do trimestre, e acho que é razoável supor que provavelmente estarão em cerca de US$ 200 bilhões no final deste trimestre”. “A decisão foi 100% minha. Vendemos tudo e perdemos bastante dinheiro”. “Como investidor você deve ir onde a concorrência é fraca. A concorrência é mais fraca nas empresas menores”.

    "published_at": "2024-05-04T20:06:24Z",
    "content": "Warren Buffett, the billionaire co-founder and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, offered some insights Saturday at the company's annual meeting into the decision to reduce its stake in tech giant Apple, which was and remains its largest stock holding. Berkshire's stake in Apple fell by 22% to $135.4 billion as of March 31 from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023, even as the iPhone maker's share price fell just 11%. The conglomerate appears to have sold about 115 million shares, or 13% of its holdings in the quarter. The sale resulted in Berkshire realizing an $11.2 billion after-tax gain in the quarter from its sale of Apple stock and contributed to the rise in the company's cash holdings to a record of $189 billion. Despite Berkshire reducing its holdings in Apple, Buffett said he expects it to remain the company's largest stock investment. \"We have sold shares and I would say that at the end of the year I would think it extremely likely that Apple is the largest common stock holding we have,\" Buffett said. He went on to explain how he and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, viewed their stock investments in companies like Apple. BUFFETT RETAKES THE STAGE AS BERKSHIRE PREPARES TO PASS THE BATON \"One interesting thing is that Charlie and I looked at common stocks or marketable equities or the things that people love to look at as being businesses, and so when we own a Dairy Queen, or we own whatever it may be, we look at it as a business. When we own Coca-Cola or American Express or Apple, we look at that as a business,\" Buffett explained. READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP \"Now, we can buy really wonderful companies in the market as businesses — we can't buy all of their shares, we can't buy 90% or 80% or anything like that,\" he added. Buffett went on to say those companies and Apple are \"wonderful\" businesses and that Berkshire's assessment of those firms is such that they'll remain major holdings unless something dramatic occurs. WARREN BUFFETT PAYS TRIBUTE TO FRIEND, CHARLIE MUNGER AS 'ARCHITECT' OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY \"We will own — unless something really extraordinary happens — we will own Apple and American Express and Coca-Cola when Greg takes over this place,\" Buffett said. Later in the question-and-answer session, Buffett cited Apple CEO Tim Cook's leadership as a reason for his confidence in the tech giant and said he has been a great successor to the late Steve Jobs. Buffett also touched on the tax consequences of selling Apple stock at this time when the capital gains tax rate is lower than it has been historically and said that it may be higher again in the future as the government looks to narrow the budget deficit. He also said that given alternatives in the market and uncertainty around the world, holding a larger cash stake is preferable. WARREN BUFFET BLASTS GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN ANNUAL LETTER \"I don't mind at all under current conditions building the cash position. I think when I look at the alternative of what's available in the equity markets and I look at the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive,\" Buffett said. \"Almost everybody I know pays a lot more attention to not paying taxes than I think they should. We don't mind paying taxes at Berkshire, and we are paying a 21% federal rate on the gains we're taking in Apple and that rate was 35% not too long ago, and it's been 52% in the past when I've been operating,\" Buffett said. \"It doesn't bother me in the least to write that check and I would really hope that with all that America has done for all of you, it shouldn't bother you that we do it and if I'm doing it at 21%, and we're doing it at a lot higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind that we sold a little Apple this year,\" he explained.

    "title": "4 lessons for success from Berkshire shareholders' best Buffett and Munger stories",
    "description": "Everyone at the Berkshire Hathaway meeting has a story about Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger. These four provide useful tips for success.",

    "content": " Related Stories On Friday afternoon, on the floor of the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, I ran into my seatmate from the flight from Washington, D.C. to Omaha — a lovely woman working the Geico booth. \"Bill Murray is here,\" she told me. I told her I'd keep my eyes peeled. Of course, to the tens of thousands of shareholders who flock each year to Nebraska, Murray, or any other celebrity, is second fiddle to the real star of the show, Warren Buffett, and in years past his right-hand man Charlie Munger, who died in 2023. Around these parts, the honchos at Berkshire do have one key thing in common with Murray: everyone who's met them seems to have a story. Earlier on Friday, I attended VALUEx BRK one of the many gatherings of investors that crop up around Omaha as sort of satellite Berkshire meetings. Run by Guy Spier, manager of the Zurich-based Aquamarine Fund, the event featured talks from a wide array of value investing enthusiasts, from investment managers to academics to authors to Munger's longtime assistant Doerthe Obert. Just about everyone who had encountered one of the Berkshire luminaries shared some of the wisdom they imparted. Here's what you can learn from their stories. Monsoon Pabrai, managing partner and portfolio manager of Drew Investment Research, recalled a lunch where she and her sister — both young girls at the time — sat on either side of Buffett. She took careful note of the three-and-a-half-hour conversation, but tends to return to one piece of advice. \"The one that always stuck with me was that he looked me and my sister in the eye, because we're women, or young girls, and said, 'The most important decision you make is who you marry,'\" she said. \"I think that goes for both partners in a marriage. It's really important who you pick to be your life partner.\" Indeed, it's advice that Buffett echoed at the shareholder meeting on Saturday. In response to a question about advice everyone needs to hear, Buffett urged shareholders to think about the way they'd like their obituaries to read and to pursue life accordingly. \"Certainly in my day it would have been marrying the person who could help you do that,\" he said. William Green, author of \"The Great Minds of Investing\" spoke alongside photographer Michael O'Brien about the experience of profiling and photographing Munger. An encounter with his friend, Berkshire board member Chris Davis, reminded him of a key piece of advice from Munger: surround yourself with images of your idols. \"Charlie told him very early on, put photos of people you admire in your office, because they're people you don't want to disappoint.\" Munger famously owned a bust of his hero, Benjamin Franklin, Green noted. Green, in turn, has a bust of Munger. \"I think this idea of structuring your physical environment to have pictures of people you admire is a really good hack. It's tilting the odds of you behaving decently,\" Green said. Gillian Segal, author of \"Getting There: A Book of Mentors\" spoke about her persistence in nailing down an interview with Buffett. After failing to get through to him remotely, she pinned him down at a charity event, where he agreed to lend her a few minutes of his time. When it came time to schedule their meeting, Segal was in for a surprise. \"Once I had gotten in past [Buffett's assistant], she was telling me all of the available times, and it was like, 'OK, this week he's available Monday,' and it was a huge block of time. Tuesday, huge block of time, Wednesday, he has this. Thursday, huge block of time,\" she says. \"And I just realized he is who he is because he guards his time. And he has time to do the important things. He's not overscheduled.\" Chances are, you don't have nearly as many people as Buffett does asking for your time – or an assistant who is an expert at guarding it. But it's an example that's useful for anyone: To be successful in your career, you'll need time to give it your undivided attention. Munger's longtime assistant Doerthe Obert told a litany of charming, personal stories about Munger, from his focus on his work to his attempts at dieting. Her recollections of her working relationship with Munger are instructive for anyone who has employees. \"We had such a good working relationship, and he just trusted me completely,\" she said. \"You'll handle it – whatever it was. You'll get it done.\" Trusting his assistant to do her work let Munger do his. And when it came to the working relationship, Munger was happy to stay in his lane, too. When I asked her what, if anything her boss taught her about investing, Obert demurred. \"He never talked to anybody about investing once,\" she told me. Never? Not even in passing? \"No. Because if he gave some advice and it [might not] work out,\" she said. \"If he loses some money, it's not so bad. But if I would lose a lot? He didn't want that responsibility.\" Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the correct spelling of William Green.  Want to make extra money outside of your day job? Sign up for CNBC's new online course How to Earn Passive Income Online to learn about common passive income streams, tips to get started and real-life success stories.

    "title": "Berkshire Hathaway’s profits plunge 64 per cent as thousands gather to soak up Warren Buffett’s wisdom",
    "description": "Buffett chaired the first annual meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-04T19:56:56Z",
    "content": "Share this article Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reported a steep drop in earnings on Saturday as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. Nevertheless, tens of thousands of shareholders looked forward to hearing from Buffett directly, buoyed by a jump in performance of the many companies Berkshire operates directly. Berkshire reported a US$12.7 billion profit, or US$8.825 per Class A share, in the first quarter, down 64% from US$35.5 billion, or US$24,377 per A share a year ago. Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate’s operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. Operating earnings jumped 39% to US$11.222 billion, or US$7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies’ strong performance. By that measure, Berkshire beat expectations of the three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research, who had predicted operating earnings of US$6,701.87 per Class A share. As part of Buffett’s stock sales, he trimmed about 13% of Berkshire’s massive Apple stake. Holdings in the iPhone maker are still Berkshire’s biggest stake, making up US$135.4 billion of the company’s US$364 billion portfolio. Buffett said he expects Apple to remain the biggest investment for years, even when his successor Greg Abel eventually takes over. As for Berkshire’s core insurance businesses, the conglomerate reported a US$2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from US$911 million a year ago. BNSF railroad’s profits dropped 8% to US$1.143 billion, but most of Bershire’s many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profit at the utility unit that added US$717 million to earnings. Cash on hand rose to a record US$188.993 billion in the quarter. “We’d love to spend it but we won’t spend it unless we’re doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,” Buffett said. Tens of thousands filled the arena eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting ‘Woodstock for Capitalists.’ But a key ingredient is missing this year: It’s the first meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died. The meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best-known quotes, including classic lines like “If people weren’t so often wrong, we wouldn’t be so rich.” The video also featured classic skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a “Desperate Housewives” spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him. As the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honouring Munger, whom Buffett called “the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.” Buffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, attending dinner parties, meetings and regular Zoom calls. “Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,” Buffett said. For decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger’s witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as “turds.” Together, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies. Munger often summed up the key Berkshire’s success as “trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.” He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well. “Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,” said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting. Munger’s absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire’s companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett’s successor. Abel and Jain shared the main stage with Buffett for the first time this year. The first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said “Charlie?” Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators’ reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit. Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about. “Greg’s a rock star,” said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. “The bench is deep. He won’t have the same humour at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.” As always, Buffett addressed a variety of topics on Saturday, though he never talks politics or reveals what he is buying. The stock he has been buying over the past year will remain a secret until he’s required to disclose it in filings. He described a recent uneasy experience with artificial intelligence, saying he saw a fake image of himself delivering a message in his voice about something he said he would never say. He predicted the technology will be a boon for scammers, and he’s not sure if it will do more good than harm. The fake video was so convincing Buffett said he might have sent money to himself overseas. “It has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don’t know how that plays out,” he said. On climate change, Jain said it’s creating larger losses for insurance companies and driving up prices. It’s hard to know if prices are increasing enough to handle the risk, but at least insurers have the opportunity to recalibrate their premiums each year, Jain said. “We get a lot of letters from people concerned about climate change — and I don’t think they’re wrong,” Buffett said. “But they don’t understand the insurance business.” Overall, Buffett said Berkshire’s system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. The 93-year-old says he hardly gets any calls from managers any more because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain. “This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,” Buffett said.

But the Oracle of Omaha still sees Apple as a critical part of Berkshire’s portfolio. Berkshire’s holdings in Apple were valued at $135.4 billion for first quarter of 2024, a 22% drop from $174.3 billion as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to its first-quarter earnings report released Saturday. It was the second consecutive quarter that the conglomerate has reduced its holdings of the iPhone maker. Apple’s share price fell 11% in the quarter, as the tech giant endured a rough start to 2024. Given those figures, Berkshire sold roughly 13% of its  holdings in the company last quarter, leaving it with about 790 million Apple shares. But Buffett said during the morning question-and-answer session at Berkshire’s annual shareholder conference on Saturday that it’s “extremely likely” that Apple remains Berkshire’s largest common stock holding — and that it will stay that way unless something dramatic happens. “Unless something really extraordinary happens, we will own Apple, and American Express, and Coca-Cola when Greg takes over this place,” the 93-year-old Buffett said, referring to Greg Abel, his handpicked successor. Berkshire reported that its American Express stake was worth $34.5 billion last quarter, and its Coca-Cola holdings were worth $24.5 billion. Chevron and Bank of America were also in the company’s top five holdings, with stakes valued at $19.4 billion and $39.2 billion, respectively. Read more: Warren Buffett on Berkshire Hathaway selling Apple stock, AI, and life after Charlie Munger Apple CEO Tim Cook was in the auditorium during Saturday’s Q&A session. He suggested that the sale may have been to avoid higher taxes, if the federal government decides to increase tax rates. “It doesn’t bother me in the least to write that check, and I would really hope with all that America’s done for all of you, it shouldn’t bother you that we do it,” Buffett said. “And if I’m doing it at 21% this year, and we’re doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don’t think you’ll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year.” Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire added $21 billion in cash and Treasuries to its pile, bringing it to a record $189 billion last quarter — a 13% increase in just three months. In the same quarter, Berkshire offloaded a net $17 billion worth of stocks and bought back $2.6 billion worth of its own stock, up from $2.2 billion in the prior quarter.

    "content": "Fund next-gen business journalism with $10 a month Search Free Newsletters Warren Buffett admittedly isn’t an expert on artificial intelligence — but what he does know makes him nervous. Speaking at a question-and-answer session at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders conference Saturday, Buffett  likened the advent of AI to his views on nuclear weapons. The Berkshire CEO referenced his remarks from the previous year’s conference, recalling that he had described the atomic bomb as a genie let out of the bottom that “has been doing some terrible things” and “scares the hell out of” him. “AI is somewhat similar, it’s part  way out of the bottle, and it’s enormously important and it’s gonna be done by somebody,” Buffet said Saturday. “We may wish we’d never seen that genie, or it may do wonderful things.” While he said he’s not very familiar with the technology, he had one experience that made him “a little nervous” about AI: He stumbled across a video using his likeness generated by AI, “delivering a message that in no way” came from him. He worried that that could open the floodgates for potential scams, calling it “the growth industry of all time.” “I do think, as someone who doesn’t understand a damn thing about about it, that it has enormous potential for good, and enormous potential for harm,” he said. “And I just don’t know how that plays out.” Read more: Warren Buffett on Berkshire Hathaway selling Apple stock, AI, and life after Charlie Munger The highly anticipated and closely watch annual conference, dubbed “Woodstock for Capitalists” by its fans, kicked off Friday in Buffett’s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska.

E Buffett allenta la presa su Apple. La battaglia dell'intelligenza artificiale Ascolta ora: \"ChatGpt pronta a lanciare l’anti-Google\" ChatGpt pronta a lanciare l’anti-Google Probabilmente nel quartier generale di Google non tira una buona aria in attesa del 9 maggio. Già perchè quel giorno, secondo indiscrezioni sempre più insistenti, verrà svelato il nuovo motore di ricerca di OpenAI, la società guidata da Sam Altman che ha sviluppato il celebre ChatGpt. Se così fosse, per Alphabet (la capogruppo di Google) si affaccerebbe all’orizzonte un competitor potenzialmente capace di mettere in discussione il suo trentennale strapotere in un campo dove occupa una quota di mercato del 90 per cento. In verità nell’ambiente tech se ne parla da tempo. Il tam tam ha preso nuovo vigore dopo che un utente su Reddit ha segnalato l’esistenza del dominio «https://search.chatgpt.com», ma al momento digitandolo ci si scontra sulla scritta «not found» ovvero non trovato. Per distinguere se si tratta di verità o leggenda, in ogni caso, basterà aspettare pochi giorni. Certo è che Altman da tempo ha annunciato la sua volontà di far lavorare insieme i cosiddetti generatori di testi basati sull’intelligenza artificiale (vedi ChatGpt) e la ricerca sul web, una fusione che dovrebbe dare vita a un prodotto molto più potente e in grado di dare risposte più precise e dettagliate ai navigatori di Internet. Le aspettative sono alte, anche perché si scrive OpenAI, ma si legge Microsoft. Il big guidato da Satya Nadella ha investito oltre 13 miliardi di dollari nella società di Altman e ne sta raccogliendo i frutti. Tant’è che gli ultimi conti trimestrali vedono un aumento degli utili del 20% proprio grazie all’intelligenza artificiale e la stessa Microsoft ha iniziato a potenziare il suo motore di ricerca Bing proprio con l’IA. Altrettanto vero è che il gruppo guidato dal ceo Sundar Pichai non è fermo: ha investito tanto per sviluppare Gemini (il suo ChatGpt) e si dice sia pronto a presentare la sua contro-mossa a stretto giro, quando alla conferenza degli sviluppatori del 14 maggio probabilmente verranno annunciati progressi sul fronte dell’IA e una risposta a OpenAI. Ma se l’accoppiata ChatGpt-Microsoft è al momento la più pericolosa per Google, anche i ritardatari dell’intelligenza artificiale stanno premendo per recuperare il terreno perduto. Il capo di Apple, Tim Cook, sta vedendo scricchiolii nel suo impero: le vendite fiacche di iPhone (-10% rispetto al primo trimestre 2023) e l’assenza di innovazioni ne potrebbero segnare il declino. Non a caso un vecchio lupo degli investimenti, Warren Buffett, con la sua Berkshire Hathaway (che nei primi tre mesi ha avuto un utile operativo monstre di 11,2 miliardi) ha aggiornato nell’ultimo trimestre il valore della sua quota in Apple: -22% a 135,4 miliardi a fronte del -11% registrato a Wall Street. In questo contesto si legge la trovata di Cook di annunciare un maxi buyback da 110 miliardi di dollari per sostenere il titolo, il più grande riacquisto di azioni della storia di Cupertino. Si lavora anche sul fronte AI, negli ultimi anni la Mela ha investito per sottrarre specialisti a Google a cui avrebbe portato via 36 tra i migliori dal 2018 a oggi. Secondo il Financial Times avrebbe realizzato un laboratorio segreto in Europa, a Zurigo, nell’intento di sviluppare nuovi prodotti che sfruttino l’intelligenza artificiale. Si prepara a puntare forte sull’IA anche Meta (la casa di Facebook e Instagram), finora a metà del guado sul suo progetto Metaverso. Il ceo Mark Zuckerberg, infatti, durante la presentazione degli ultimi conti ha indicato un target di costi fino a 10 miliardi superiore per lo sviluppo dell’IA nel 2024.\n\n\n\n\n Un annuncio che ha fatto crollare il titolo (-15%), ma che potrebbe pagare sul lungo termine.  \r\n\t\t\tSpiacenti, devi abilitare javascript per poter procedere.\r\n\t\t"

    "content": "Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway offloaded around 13% of its Apple holdings in Q1 2024, the conglomerate revealed this weekend. Despite selling around 115 million shares, however, Buffett reaffirmed his commitment to AAPL going forward.  Meanwhile, Tim Cook, who made the trip to Omaha for Berkshire’s annual meeting on Saturday, praised Buffett for his belief in Apple.  As reported by CNBC, Berkshire’s Q1 2024 earnings report revealed that its stake in Apple is now worth $135.4 billion – indicating that it holds around 790 million shares. Based on Apple’s stock price, this would mean Berkshire sold about 115 million shares, CNBC says.  Still, Apple is Berkshire’s largest holding by a wide margin. Likewise, Berkshire is Apple’s largest shareholder outside of ETF providers.  During Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting on Saturday, Buffett praised Apple and said it’s an “an even better business” than two of the conglomerate’s other major holdings, American Express and Coca-Cola. Buffett also assured investors: “Unless something dramatic happens that really changes capital allocation, we will have Apple as our largest investment.”  Buffett didn’t offer specific details on why Berkshire sold 13% of its Apple holdings in the quarter. He did, however, imply that it was to increase its cash stake for tax purposes:  “It doesn’t bother me in the least to write that check and I would really hope with all that America’s done for all of you, it shouldn’t bother you that we do it and if I’m doing it at 21% this year and we’re doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don’t think you’ll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year.” Apple CEO Tim Cook was in the audience of Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on Saturday. With regard to Berkshire’s decision to offload some of its Apple holdings, Cook told CNBC that “it’s a privilege to have them as a shareholder.” When Berkshire sold 10 million shares of AAPL in 2020, Buffett later admitted that the decision “was probably a mistake.” In Q4 2023, Berkshire offloaded around 1% of its AAPL holdings (10 million shares), so this marks the second consecutive quarter that the conglomerate reduced its stake in Apple.

A afirmação foi feita durante a reunião anual de acionistas da companhia em Omaha, Nebraska, neste sábado (4). Buffett declarou que pretende deixar a alocação de capital sob os cuidados de Greg, que respondeu a perguntas dos acionistas a seu lado. “E ele entende muito bem de negócios”, disse aos acionistas. “As somas cresceram tanto na Berkshire e não queremos tentar ter duas pessoas por perto que gerem bilhões cada. Simplesmente não funciona”, acrescentou, descartando uma possível divisão do cargo. “Veremos como a próxima gestão jogará o jogo na Berkshire, [mas] felizmente você não terá que esperar muito por isso. Me sinto bem, mas conheço um pouco de tábua atuarial”, disse, brincando sobre as estimativas de expectativa de vida em seu país. Continua depois da publicidade Ainda sobre sucessão no conglomerado, o “Oráculo de Omaha” declarou que “qualquer pessoa que queira se aposentar aos 65 anos seria desqualificada como potencial CEO da Berkshire”, afastando qualquer especulação de que seu substituto duraria pouco tempo no cargo. Baixe um ebook gratuito que revela o método Warren Buffett de investir em ações Abel, de 61 anos, é canadense e ocupa desde 2018 uma das vice-presidências da Berkshire Hathaway. Seu nome ganhou destaque a partir de 2021, quando o “Oráculo de Omaha”, como Buffett é conhecido, confirmou que Abel será seu sucessor na presidência da holding. Ainda não há uma data definida para essa transição ocorrer. Continua depois da publicidade A ausência do “braço direito” de Buffett, Charlie Munger – falecido em outubro de 2023 –, foi sentida durante o evento. Ao finalizar um comentário sobre investimentos em energia, o lendário investidor disse: “Naturalmente, Charlie”, como fazia à espera de seu comentário. A menção levou a aplausos. Buffett queria, na verdade, passar a palavra para Abel, seu sucessor. O InfoMoney faz uma cobertura especial da conferência anual de acionistas da Berkshire Hathaway. Henrique Esteter, coordenador multiplataforma, acompanha o evento como enviado especial a Omaha, no estado americano de Nebraska. Às 18h, acompanhe a live sobre os pontos altos do encontro. A reunião da Berkshire é diferente da maioria dos encontros com acionistas promovidos por outras empresas. De um lado, o dia é uma vitrine para as muitas companhias nas quais Buffett tem participação – elas montam estandes na CHI Health Center Arena, em Omaha, no estado de Nebraska, onde ocorre o evento.

    "content": "Berkshire Hathaway says its first quarter profit plummeted on the paper value of its investments OMAHA, Neb. -- Berkshire Hathaway's first quarter profits plummeted along with the paper value of its investments, but the company said Saturday that most of the businesses it owns outright performed well. The company reported reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That’s roughly one-third of last year's $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share. The figures were heavily influenced by a large drop in the paper value of Berkshire’s investments. Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate’s operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. Operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year’s $8.065 billion as its insurance companies showed strong results. On a per share basis, this year's first quarter operating figure amounts to $7,796.47 per Class A share, beating three analysts' estimates by FactSet Research, who predicted $6,701.87 per Class A share. Buffett was a net seller of $17 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13% of Berkshire’s massive Apple stake. At $135.4 billion, the iPhone maker still accounts for the biggest share of Berkshire's $364 billion portfolio. Buffett said he expects it to remain so even up to when his successor Greg Abel takes over. The estimated value of Berkshire’s Apple stake suggests Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. In the past, Buffett has said he invested in Apple’s stock because of how devoted consumers are to the company's products, similar to consumer brands he loves like Berkshire's own See's Candy. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder, and he knew about the sales before Berkshire disclosed them Saturday. Berkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago, as Geico in particular continued to improve its results. However, BNSF railroad’s profits dropped 8% to $1.143 billion. Most of Berkshire's many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit, adding $717 million to Berkshire’s total. Revenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion. With no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire’s cash pile climbed to a record $188.993 billion even after it spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year. Holdings including Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash. “We’d love to spend it but we won’t spend it unless we’re doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,” Buffett said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

But “Woodstock for capitalists” took place without Charlie Munger, Buffett’s longtime business partner who passed away in November. The meeting featured a video tribute to Munger, who served as vice chairman, and praise from Buffett, who said Munger was the best person to talk to about managing money, according to remarks broadcast on CNBC. “I trust my children and my wife totally, but that doesn’t mean I ask them what stocks to buy,” he said. Artificial intelligence risks Buffett also recalled seeing an AI-generated image of himself and warned on the technology’s potential for scamming people. “Scamming has always been part of the American scene,” he told shareholders. “But this would make me—if I was interested in investing in scamming—it’s going to be the growth industry of all time.” He then likened AI to nuclear weapons, saying “I don’t know any way to get the genie back in the bottle, and AI is somewhat similar,” according to CNBC. Succession outlook Buffett, 93, had already indicated three years ago that Vice Chairman of Non-Insurance Operations Greg Abel would take over for him.  But he dropped a hint on Saturday about when new management would actually come into office, saying “you don’t have too long to wait on that.” While he said he feels fine, he quipped that he shouldn’t sign any four-year employment contracts. Buffett also confirmed that Abel will be in charge of investing decisions, saying that responsibility “ought to be entirely” with the next CEO. Questions had arisen about Berkshire’s closely followed portfolio as Buffett has acknowledged he delegated some calls and that certain stock picks were made by others. Canada investment? Buffett has lamented the lack of attractive investment opportunities in recent years, allowing Berkshire’s massive stockpile of cash and cash equivalents to reach fresh record highs.  Indeed, it surged to $189 billion at the end of the first quarter from $167.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. On Saturday, Buffett reiterated that when it comes to investments, “we only swing at pitches we like.” But he also teased, “We do not feel uncomfortable in any way shape or form putting our money into Canada. In fact, we’re actually looking at one thing now.” Those comments came after he touched on his investment in Japanese trading houses, saying it’s “unlikely we will make any large commitments in other countries.”  © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

He is also a co-founder and a commissioning editor at Hypatia Press, a publisher that specializes in philosophical works that challenge religion or spirituality.  \n\tDonald Trump's first criminal trial has been filled with salacious testimony, but a well-known financial reporter who has been covering the former president for years said on Saturday that one thing in particular simply didn't add up.\n \n\tNew York Times reporter Susanne Craig, who is known for following the finances of Trump and his business empire, appeared on MSNBC over the weekend to talk about Trump and his current trial. In that case in Manhattan, the ex-president is accused with more than 30 felonies in connection with an alleged scheme to impact the 2016 election by covering up hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. \n\tThe host asked Craig about testimony that could potentially \"humanize\" Trump, including an anecdote that Trump's longtime aide, Hope Hicks, shared on Friday. She said under oath that Trump asked that the newspaper not be delivered after news broke of his alleged affairs, potentially bolstering Trump's defense that he wasn't trying to affect the election with the purported payments meant to silence Daniels.\n ALSO READ: Trump vs. history: Former presidents typically implode on their comeback tours \n\t\"I am curious how Donald Trump handled himself in court listening to this formerly close aide, someone described as being like a daughter to him. Did she manage to humanize him to the jury, particularly when she said the part like, he did not want the newspapers to be delivered to the home, to the residence for fear that Melania would see them and get upset. \"\n \n\tCraig said that comment was \"interesting because you imagine Melania in this tower with no other information, so we won't drop off the newspapers.\"\n \n\t\"That did not add up to me,\" she said of the comment, which could be seen as one of the few hints Trump was thinking about Melania's reaction as opposed to the general election.\n \n\tOn Trump's behavior while Hicks made her comments, Craig said that, for the most part, \"he's sitting there and he has his eyes closed.\" She said he didn't even react much when Hicks burst into tears on the stand. \n\t\"He is trying not to have any reaction to what is going on in the courtroom,\" she explained. \"Occasionally he will pay attention and be watching a witness. For the most part, we are not seeing that. I'm interested in how that is playing with the jury. They are watching him and seeing that. I can't imagine that is helping him.\"\n Watch below or click the link here.

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File) Berkshire’s cash pile: After Berkshire’s earning report showed the conglomerate’s cash pile had risen to a record $189 billion, Buffett said it’s a “fair assumption” that its cash and treasuries would exceed $200 billion at the end of this quarter, adding the company would “love to spend it” but wouldn’t unless it was on “something that has very little risk and could make us a lot of money.” Apple: Buffett said Berkshire’s opinion on the virtue of Apple stock had not changed despite Saturday’s news Berkshire sold a reported 13% of its stock in the tech giant this quarter, saying it was “extremely likely” Apple would remain Berkshire’s biggest investment by the end of the year “unless something really dramatic happens.” Taxes: He suggested selling Apple stock now could help Berkshire pay larger tax rates in the future, as he believes the federal government will soon increase corporate taxes, which he would not oppose, saying ”It doesn’t bother me in the least to write that check,” adding that “with all America has done for all of you, it shouldn’t bother you that we do it.” Artificial intelligence: Buffett sounded the alarm on advancements in artificial intelligence, recalling how he was startled by an AI-generated video of himself created by a scammer, saying artificial intelligence could make scamming the “growth industry of all time” and that while acknowledging it’s “enormously important,” he compared its potential to do harm to nuclear weapons, arguing: “we may wish we’d never seen that genie or it may do wonderful things.” Foreign investments: Buffett said that he doesn’t anticipate Berkshire making many significant investments outside the U.S., except the conglomerate was willing to invest in Canada, and was in the midst of “looking at one thing now.” Succession: Buffett, 93, teased his eventual succession, quipping that investors “don’t have too long to wait,” adding “I feel fine, but I know a little bit about actuarial tables” (he has already named Greg Abel, Berkshire’s vice chairman of non-insurance operations, as his eventual successor).

Berkshire on Saturday reported profits of $12.7 billion—a fraction of the $35.5 billion it reported in the first quarter of last year—but this drop was driven almost exclusively by a sharp drop in the value of Berkshire’s stock portfolio. The conglomerate’s operating earnings, or the profits generated directly by the businesses that it owns, rose 39%, from $8.065 billion in the first quarter of 2023 to $11.2 billion this year. Buffett has long argued operating profits are a more valuable metric than net profits. Berkshire benefited from a strong performance from its insurance businesses, which include Geico, and its operating earnings from insurance underwriting rose to $2.6 billion from $911 million last year. Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholders meeting in Omaha is a hotly anticipated financial event each year, with investors eagerly awaiting to hear Buffett’s advice and predictions on finances and the economy. It’s often referred to as “Woodstock for capitalists.” But this year’s event took on a different tenor, as it was the first time Buffett took the stage to speak with shareholders without Charlie Munger, his longtime friend and business partner who died last year.  This year’s event was filled with tributes to Munger, including a video featuring Munger’s and Buffett’s many interviews and pop culture appearances—like on the sitcom “the Office.” While answering questions from investors, Buffett turned to Abel and mistakenly called him “Charlie,” drawing laughter and cheer from the crowd. “I’d actually checked myself a couple times already,” Buffett said. “I’ll slip again.”  One Community.

Abel has been overseeing a major portion of Berkshire's sprawling empire, including energy, railroad and retail. Buffett offered the clearest insight into his succession plan to date after years of speculation about the exact roles of Berkshire's top executives after the eventual transition. The investing icon, who's turning 94 in August, said his decision is influenced by how much Berkshire's assets have grown. \"I used to think differently about how that would be handled, but I think that responsibility should be that of the CEO and whatever that CEO decides may be helpful,\" Buffett said. \"The sums have grown so large at Berkshire, and we do not want to try and have 200 people around that are managing a billion each. It just doesn't work.\" Berkshire's cash pile ballooned to nearly $189 billion at the end of March, while its gigantic equity portfolio has stocks worth a whopping $362 billion based on current market prices. \"I think what you're handling the sums that we will have, you've got to think very strategically about how to do very big things,\" Buffett added. \"I think the responsibility ought to be entirely with Greg.\" While Buffett has made clear that Abel would be taking over the CEO job, there were still questions about who would control the Berkshire public stock portfolio, where Buffett has garnered a huge following by racking up huge returns through investments in the likes of Coca-Cola and Apple. Berkshire investing managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, both former hedge fund managers, have helped Buffett manage a small portion of the stock  portfolio (about 10%) for about the last decade. There was speculation that they may take over that portion of the Berkshire CEO role when he is no longer able. But it seems, based on Buffett's latest comments, that Abel will have final decisions on all capital allocation — including stock picks. \"I think the chief executive should be somebody that can weigh buying businesses, buying stocks, doing all kinds of things that might come up at a time when nobody else is willing to move,\" Buffett said. Abel is known for his strong expertise in the energy industry. Berkshire acquired MidAmerican Energy in 1999 and Abel became CEO of the company in 2008, six years before it was renamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy in 2014. Correction: Berkshire's equity portfolio is worth $362 billion. A previous version misstated the figure. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Ele comparou a tecnologia a armas nucleares, quanto a seu potencial para grandes mudanças. Baixe um ebook gratuito que revela o método Warren Buffett de investir em ações Ao falar sobre o assunto para uma plateia de cerca de 30 mil pessoas, o “Oráculo de Omaha” afirmou que não “sabe nada” sobre IA, mas relatou ter visto recentemente uma imagem sua gerada por ferramentas de iteligência artificial e que isso o deixou nervoso com a tecnologia. Continua depois da publicidade “Quando você pensa sobre o potencial de enganar as pessoas, se você puder reproduzir imagens que nem consigo dizer, que dizem, ‘Preciso de dinheiro’, ‘Acabei de sofrer um acidente de carro, preciso de US$ 50 mil’.

Buffett acrescentou que o ser humano deixou “o gênio sair da garrafa” quando desenvolveu armas nucleares. “Esse gênio tem feito coisas terríveis ultimamente, e o poder desse gênio é o que, você sabe, me assusta muito”, acrescentou. “E não conheço nenhuma maneira de colocar o gênio de volta na garrafa, e a IA é um tanto semelhante.” O InfoMoney faz uma cobertura especial da conferência anual de acionistas da Berkshire Hathaway.

    "content": "Share this article Berkshire Hathaway shareholders pose with the mascot for one of its companies, Oriental Trading, while the more famous spokeslizard for Geico insurance looms over their shoulder. Photo / Josh Funk, AP Warren Buffett cautioned the tens of thousands of shareholders who packed an arena for his annual meeting that artificial intelligence scams could become “the growth industry of all time.” Doubling down on his cautionary words from last year, Buffett told the throngs he recently came face-to-face with the downside of AI. And it looked and sounded just like him. Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that the so-called Oracle of Omaha himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas. The billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the technology, and may do more harm with it than society can wring good. “As someone who doesn’t understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don’t know how that plays out,” he said. The day started early Saturday with Berkshire Hathaway announcing a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. The company reported a $12.7 billion profit (NZ$21.1b), or $8,825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64 per cent from $35.5b, or $24,377 per A share a year ago. But Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate’s operating earnings from the companies it actually owns. Those jumped 39 per cent to $11.222b, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies’ performance. None of it that got in the way of the fun. Throngs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallows of Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who died last fall. The event attracts investors from all over the world and is unlike any other company meeting. Those attending for the first time are driven by an urgency to get here while the 93-year-old Buffett is still alive. “This is one of the best events in the world to learn about investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,” said Akshay Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days travelling from India to Omaha. Devotees come from all over the world to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting “Woodstock for Capitalists”. But a key ingredient was missing this year: It was the first meeting since Munger died. The meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like “If people weren’t so often wrong, we wouldn’t be so rich.” The video also featured skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a Desperate Housewives spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jamie Lee Curtis swooned over him. As the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honouring Munger, whom Buffett called “the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.” Buffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and holding regular Zoom calls. “Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,” Buffett said. For decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger’s witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as “turds.” Together, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies. Munger often summed up the key to Berkshire’s success as “trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.” He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well. “Warren always did at least 80 per cent of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,” said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting. Munger’s absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire’s companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units; and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett’s successor. The two shared the main stage with Buffett this year. The first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said “Charlie?” Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators’ reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit. Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he believes Abel spoke up more Saturday and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about. Abel offered a twist on Munger’s classic “I have nothing to add” line by often starting his answers Saturday by saying “The only thing I would add.” “Greg’s a rock star,” said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. “The bench is deep. He won’t have the same humour at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.” A look to the future Buffett has made clear that Abel will be Berkshire’s next CEO, but he said Saturday that he had changed his opinion on how the company’s investment portfolio should be handled.  He had previously said it would fall to two investment managers who handle small chunks of the portfolio now. On Saturday, Buffett endorsed Abel for the gig, as well as overseeing the operating businesses and any acquisitions. “He understands businesses extremely well and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks,” Buffett said. Ultimately, it will be up to the board to decide, but the billionaire said he might come back and haunt them if they try to do it differently. Overall, Buffett said Berkshire’s system of having all the non-insurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. He himself hardly gets any calls from managers anymore because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain. “This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,” Buffett said. Nevertheless, the best applause line of the day was Buffett’s closing remark: “I not only hope that you come next year but I hope that I come next year.” -Josh Funk covers railroads & Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway for The Associated Press Share this article Deputy Prime Minister eyeing tax and investment strategies used by other small nations."

    "content": "This year’s Berkshire Hathaway meeting gave shareholders their best chance yet to hear from the man who will one day take over as CEO when Warren Buffett is gone, but Buffett said for the first time Saturday that Greg Abel should also take responsibility for the company’s investments after he takes over, raising new questions about the succession plan. Abel put his encyclopedic knowledge of the utility business that he led directly for years on display and delved into railroad operations and potential acquisitions that Berkshire pursued while sharing the stage with Buffett all day. For his part, the 93-year-old billionaire showed investors he is still sharp. Abel pointed out that it required a major culture shift to get workers at PacifiCorp and the other utilities, who have long focused all their energy on keeping the lights on, to think about shutting the power down at times when the risk that their power lines could spark wildfires is too great. He also said BNSF railroad is working on getting “our cost structure right” after delivering disappointing results. Succession was clearly top of mind for many of the thousands of people who filled an Omaha arena to listen to the two men after last fall’s death of Vice Chairman Charlie Munger. Buffett, Abel and Ajit Jain, Berkshire’s other top executive who oversees the company’s insurers, reassured investors that Berkshire’s board spends plenty of time focused on “what would happen to the operation if I get hit by a truck,” as Jain put it. Finding the right replacement for any of the three of them will be important. Previously, Buffett had said that when Abel becomes CEO, investment managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, who’s also taken on the responsibility of being Geico’s CEO, would handle Berkshire’s massive portfolio. But Buffett said Saturday that his thinking has evolved, and that “I would probably, knowing Greg, I would leave the capital allocation to Greg.” And Buffett said because Abel understands businesses so well, he also understands stocks. But Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said a good business doesn’t always make a good stock unless you get the timing and position size right, and there is an art to that. “I think stock picking is hard. I don’t think it’s something you can just start doing and be good at it,” Shanahan said. Abel does have a history of making multibillion-dollar deals when he was the head of Berkshire’s utility unit for a decade, including the acquisitions of NV Energy and AltaLink, but he’s never been a stock picker. Weschler and Combs might be able to help Abel get the timing right and find opportunities in the stock market, but Buffett didn’t say that Saturday. Abel just reassured shareholders that “the capital allocation principles that we use today will be maintained.” “Does that give you more or less confidence post-Buffett? I would say it’s got to give you less — not because it’s a worse circumstance — but because it hasn’t been very transparent and communicated that clearly. You’ve got to start asking, well, what else is going to change?” said Cole Smead with Smead Capital Management. Abel definitely has the confidence of the CEOs at all of Berkshire’s many varied noninsurance businesses who report to him and ask his advice on any challenges they are facing. “Greg sees so much more than I do on a daily basis. So his perspective is valued, and his wisdom is something that is such a luxury for all of us to be able to tap into,” said Dan Sheridan, who just became CEO of Brooks Running this year after his predecessor retired. He said Abel is always humble and curious about the business, even while asking challenging questions. See’s Candies CEO Pat Egan added that Abel reflects all of Berkshire’s core values, with the company’s emphasis on integrity, taking care of customers and strengthening brands, while still giving Berkshire’s subsidiaries the freedom to operate independently. “He really expects us to know our business, understand the parameters, and to run our business on a day to day basis,” said Tim Baucom, CEO of flooring giant Shaw Industries. “So I feel like I have all the freedom of the world, but with freedom comes responsibility.” The shareholders who attended the meeting and spent hours shopping and talking with executives at the booths Berkshire subsidiaries set up when they weren’t listening to Buffett and Abel remain confident. Some of them even got the chance to take selfies with Abel, though Buffett no longer tours the exhibit hall in public. “I think they’ll be fine,” said Michael Grizzard, who made the trip to Omaha from Richmond, Virginia, for the second time. “They’re in good hands, and I think they have a good culture.” Smead said even Buffett, who is easily one of the greatest investors the world has ever seen, has been having a hard time lately finding good investments big enough to make a difference at Berkshire except for the $135 billion Apple stake that remains its largest investment even after some trimming this year. So no matter how good an investor Abel is, he will have a hard time finding deals big enough to provide a meaningful boost to Berkshire’s earnings that approached $13 billion in a down first quarter. That challenge is a big part of why Buffett has warned investors not to expect any of the “eye-popping performance” of Berkshire’s past. But for now, Buffett showed that Abel may not need to take over anytime soon because he looked good and he has long said he has no plans to retire, even if he acknowledged Saturday that he doesn’t have the same energy he used to. CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert came away impressed with his stamina. “There wasn’t anything in that performance that I found worrisome or troubling,” Seifert said. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

    "content": "Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett speaks during an interview with Liz Claman on Fox Business Network's Countdown to the Closing Bell, on May 7, 2018, in Omaha, Neb.Nati Harnik/The Associated Press Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK-A-N has set its sights on making a major new investment in Canada. The U.S. conglomerate holding company, whose top shareholder is the 93-year-old billionaire, held its annual meeting on Saturday, live-streamed from a packed arena in Omaha, Neb. Greg Abel, who is vice-chair of Hathaway’s non-insurance operations, is a Canadian who is widely seen to be Mr. Buffett’s successor in the executive suite and eventually become the company’s chair. Members of Berkshire’s leadership team are now mulling options for a new foray into Canada. “When we see anything that’s suggesting an idea that’s of a size with interest here and meets other requirements, they don’t have any hesitancy about putting big money in Canada,” Mr. Buffett said during the meeting. “There are things we actually can do fairly well, where Canada could benefit from Berkshire’s participation.” The Oracle of Omaha heaped praise on Canada. “We do not feel uncomfortable in any way, shape or form, putting our money into Canada,” Mr. Buffett said. “We don’t have any mental blocks about that country. And of course, there’s a lot of countries we don’t understand at all. So Canada, it’s terrific when you’ve got a major economy – not the size of the U.S., but a major economy that you absolutely, you feel confident about operating there.” Mr. Abel also serves as chair of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which includes existing Canadian assets. Assets north of the border include Calgary-based Berkshire Hathaway Energy Canada, which operates 13,000 kilometres of transmission lines and 300 substations in Alberta through AltaLink. “It goes across many of our operating entities and then, as Warren touched on, all the businesses that we have a piece of that we’re invested in are up in Canada. So the presence is significant,” Mr. Abel said during the meeting. “We’re always looking at making incremental investments there because it’s an environment we’re very comfortable with.” Mr. Abel recently received the Canadian Business Leader Award in Edmonton from the University of Alberta, where he graduated with a bachelor of commerce in 1984. At the university, he had plans to major in finance but later switched to accounting. While it has been four decades since he graduated from the Edmonton university, he still visits friends and family regularly in Alberta, and he continues to monitor the Canadian economy. “I would say the economy moves very closely to the U.S. So the results we’re seeing out of our various businesses that report both the U.S. and Canadian operations aren’t drastically different,” Mr. Abel said. “On the energy side, for example, we make very substantial investments up there in Alberta. But again, it’s very consistent with how that economy is growing.” He is the nephew of the late Sid Abel, a hockey Hall of Famer who played for the Detroit Red Wings.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 176.59 points, or 0.46%, to close at 38,852.27. It was the fourth consecutive winning session for the 30-stock index. The S&P 500 advanced 1.03% to end at 5,180.74, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.19% to reach 16,349.25. An announcement from Hamas on Monday that it accepted an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal to end the war with Israel gave stocks a boost in early afternoon trading. Wall Street is coming off a winning session after fresh nonfarm payrolls data on Friday showed fewer-than-expected jobs were added in April along with an increase in unemployment, easing fears of an overheating economy. \"It's good that we're getting some sort of a continuation, because it seems as if the market is saying that the pullback is over and we'll just work our way back up,\" CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall said, adding that Monday's momentum is a reaction to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's statement last week that ruled out a rate hike as the central bank's next move. That \"made investors breathe a sigh of relief,\" Stovall said. While the peak of the first-quarter earnings season has passed, investors are still watching key companies set to report this week, including Dow member Disney on Tuesday and Uber on Wednesday. On Saturday, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a nearly 40% surge in year-over-year operating earnings for the first quarter. Berkshire also held its annual shareholders meeting. Micron gained 4.7% after Baird upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral and said it sees \"meaningful opportunities ahead\" for the chipmaker. American Airlines and Super Micro Computer were also among the top-performing S&P 500 stocks, gaining about 5.8% and 6.1%, respectively.   Correction: A previous version misstated when Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke. More than three-quarters of the way through earnings season, and it is another strong showing for the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Of the six that have already reported, only Tesla has missed estimates. According to earnings data provider LSEG, aggregate earnings for the Magnificent Seven are expected to soar 49% year over year. In contrast, the other 493 S&P 500 stocks are on pace to see just flat earnings growth this season, up 0.4%. The Magnificent Seven's strong growth has been fueled by particularly robust performance from Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Amazon over the past couple of weeks. But no stock will have more of an effect than Nvidia, which reports results on May 22. The chipmaker's earnings are expected to surge more than five times last year's levels. Nvidia alone is expected to make up more than one-third of the 7% earnings growth the entire S&P 500 is now seeing this season. — Robert Hum Here is how the major indexes closed on Monday: — Pia Singh Citadel CEO Ken Griffin told CNBC's Sarah Eisen that developments in artificial intelligence could help improve the everyday lives of Americans and the economy. \"AI has really transformed the mindset of corporate America towards using technology again to really try to jumpstart productivity. And corporate America is rising to that moment,\" Ken Griffin said on \"Power Lunch.\" — Jesse Pound Some investors may have sniffed out a buy-the-dip opportunity in precious metals, according to Deutsche Bank. Analyst Michael Hsueh said in a note to clients Monday that platinum funds have seen a recent uptick in inflows after platinum prices have drifted well below that of gold. \"Platinum is one step closer to gold compared with palladium from an investment standpoint. One piece of the argument may depend on a relative value rationale versus gold; XPTXAU reached a new record low in April,\" Hsueh said. The Abrdn Physical Platinum Shares ETF (PPLT) has seen about $34 million in flows over the past month, according to FactSet. Its price has fallen 3.9% this year, compared to a gain of 11.4% for SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). — Jesse Pound Strategas' sentiment toward the China market has made a marked pivot from \"no way\" last year, to \"this may be more of a strategic turn,\" according to Strategas' head of macro research and technical strategy Chris Verrone. \"Time will reveal all, but the big momentum in the China indices is not to be ignored and is spilling to the EEM which has been among the first of the bellwether global indices to break out (along with the U.K. FTSE 100),\" Verrone said in a Monday note. An upturn in China could further strengthen the bull case for industrial metals, particularly copper, Verrone added. The benchmark Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index is up around 1.5% in May. — Hakyung Kim Small-cap names saw outsized gains on Monday. The small-cap focused Russell 2000 rose around 1.3% in afternoon trading. By comparison, the broad S&P 500 added less than 1%. That offers a bright spot amid a rough patch for the index. The Russell 2000 has fallen nearly 3% in the second quarter, bringing its 2024 gain to under 2%. The S&P 500 has slipped less than 2% in the quarter, and is still up more than 8% on the year. — Alex Harring Earnings growth will drive upside for the S&P 500 this year, one strategist said. \"Clearly last year was the story of valuation expansion,\" Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"We think this year if S&P returns positive, it will be because earnings growth is positive.\" The strategist expects earnings growth to expand to about 10% this year, compared to 0% to 1% last year. Importantly, she expects earnings growth will be driven by the broader market in the back half of 2024, as opposed to the few megacap tech stocks that defined the first part of the year. \"First quarter, if you take out the Mag Seven, the S&P 493, not very impressive, probably flattish earnings growth, but in the back half of the year 5050,\" Mahajan said. \"So even if you take out the Mag Seven, we're still looking at a nice 5% to 7% earnings growth for the rest of the market. And we think that's really the story.\" The strategist expects that could unlock value in cyclical parts of the market, and finds midcaps especially attractive. — Sarah Min Walt Disney is expected to report earnings before the bell Tuesday. Analysts polled by LSEG expect the theme park operator to post earnings of $1.10 per share and revenues totaling roughly $22.11 billion for its fiscal second quarter. Read more on the other key metrics analysts are watching here. — Samantha Subin These are the companies making the biggest moves in midday trading: For more, see our full list here. — Tanaya Macheel Warren Buffett's commentary during the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting should indicate that he does not see much opportunity in the current market, according to Bill Smead, investing chief at Smead Capital Management. \"If you look at what he's doing, he is as bearish as he ever gets,\" Smead told CNBC's \"The Exchange.\" With record levels of cash and a trimmed Apple position, Smead said it is clear that Buffett is \"nibbling on something below the surface\" that has yet to be announced. But he also said it appears that Berkshire, at its current state, does not see many areas to put money to work. \"Basically, he is waiting until the next 40% decline in the stock market to apply massive amounts of capital at bargain prices to things that are large enough to be meaningful to this company at the size it is now,\" he said. — Alex Harring Crude oil futures were steady as the market tried to understand the status of a Gaza cease-fire proposal. Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas' political bureau, said in a statement the militant group informed Egypt and Qatar of its \"approval of their proposal regarding a cease-fire agreement.\" Israel has not yet released an official statement on the matter. But an Israeli official told Reuters that Hamas had approved a softened Egyptian proposal that is not acceptable to Israel. The West Texas Intermediate contract for June was up 16 cents, or 0.2%, at $78.27 a barrel. Brent futures for July were 18 cents, or 0.22%, higher at $83.14 a barrel. — Spencer Kimball Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin on Monday said policymakers can afford to be patient as they look for inflation to come down. Citing recent economic data, Barkin acknowledged that inflation has not made much progress this year but noted that growth remains strong and the labor market also is holding in. \"The recent data whiplash has only confirmed the value of the Fed being deliberate,\" the central bank official said during a speech in Columbia, South Carolina. \"The economy is moving toward better balance, but no one wants inflation to reemerge. We have said we want to gain greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent target. And given a strong labor market, we have time to gain that confidence.\" — Jeff Cox Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz no longer has a role at the coffee chain, but he has plenty of thoughts about the company's disappointing quarterly report. Schultz wrote in a LinkedIn post Sunday that the company needs to improve its mobile order experience and reevaluate how it creates new products. He also said company management should spend more time with people who work in its stores. \"The company's fix needs to begin at home: U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company's fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience, through the eyes of a merchant. The answer does not lie in data, but in the stores,\" Schultz said. Shares of Starbucks were up less than 1% on Monday. — Jesse Pound High interest in Saturday's Kentucky Derby could translate into a better-than-expected quarter for Churchill Downs, according to Deutsche Bank. \"In a weekend packed with significant sporting events, including the Miami Grand Prix and Real Madrid winning La Liga, Churchill Downs reported a strong performance at the 150th Kentucky Derby. CHDN reported that wagering from all sources on the Kentucky Derby Day program increased to $320.5 million (+11% versus $288.7 million in 2023), with all-sources wagering on the Kentucky Derby race coming at $210.7 million (+11.7% versus $188.7 million in 2023),\" analyst Ricardo Chinchilla said in a note to clients Sunday. The television audience for the Kentucky Derby was the largest since 1989, according to NBC Sports. NBC and CNBC are both part of NBC Universal. Shares of Churchill Downs were up 1.5% Monday. — Jesse Pound Two exchange-traded funds tied to silver jumped in Monday morning trading. The iShares Silver Trust (SLV) and the Global X Silver Miners ETF (SIL) each climbed more than 3%. At those levels, both are on track to see their best days since early April. The iShares fund track's the metal's price, which touched its highest level in more than a week on Monday. The Global X ETF was led higher by Endeavour Silver, Coeur Mining and First Majestic Silver, which all popped at least 5%. — Alex Harring, Gina Francolla Stocks kicked the week off on a positive note. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 173 points, or 0.5%. The S&P 500 added 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.3%. — Pia Singh Here are some of the stocks making notable moves before the bell: See the full list here. — Alex Harring Shares of iPhone manufacturer Foxconn spiked as much as 6.73% after the company reported a 19.03% year-on-year rise in April revenue. Foxconn, which trades as Hon Hai Precision Industry in Taiwan, recorded 510.9 billion New Taiwan dollars, or $15.83 billion, in revenue in April, compared to the NT$447.54 billion recorded in March. The company said its component business, as well as its cloud and networking products, \"delivered strong growth,\" while its smart consumer electronics and computing products segment \"showed significant year on year growth in revenue.\" — Lim Hui Jie The Japanese yen will face upside resistance against the U.S. dollar at the 150 level despite two rounds of suspected intervention by Japanese authorities last week, says SMBC economist Ryota Abe. The yen abruptly strengthened on April 29 and May 2, leading analysts to believe that Japan's finance ministry bought yen to stem the currency's slide. Abe also noted that Japan's authorities are unlikely to intervene unless the yen weakens again. But he also said the rate differential between the U.S. and Japan will remain as such if both central banks keep their monetary policies unchanged. The yen was trading at 153.64 at 11:18 a.m. Tokyo time. — Lim Hui Jie A private survey showed the expansion in China's services activity slowed slightly in April from March. The Caixin/S&P Global services purchasing managers' index came in at 52.5 in April, ticking down from 52.7 in March. \"Although slightly softer, growth was again solid and has now been sustained for 16 consecutive months,\" the survey read. A PMI reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity, while a reading below that level points to a contraction. — Shreyashi Sanyal Business activity in Hong Kong's private sector expanded at a slower pace in April, according to S&P Global. The purchasing managers' index for the city slipped to 50.6 from March's 50.9. Jingyi Pan, Economics Associate Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the reading signaled another improvement in business conditions at the start of the second quarter. However, Pan said the growth appears to be on \"shaky ground,\" highlighting that forward-looking indicators, such as the decline in new business orders in April, hinted at softening conditions. — Lim Hui Jie Warren Buffett revealed that he dumped Berkshire Hathaway's entire Paramount stake at a loss. \"I was 100% responsible for the Paramount decision,\" Buffett said at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting on Saturday. \"We've sold it all and we lost quite a bit of money.\" The Omaha-based conglomerate first bought a nonvoting stake in Paramount's class B shares in the first quarter of 2022. Since then, the media company has had a tough ride, experiencing a dividend cut, earnings miss and a CEO exit. The stock is down nearly 24% in 2024.

    "content": "This year’s Berkshire Hathaway meeting gave shareholders their best chance yet to hear from the man who will one day take over as CEO when Warren Buffett is gone This year's Berkshire Hathaway meeting gave shareholders their best chance yet to hear from the man who will one day take over as CEO when Warren Buffett is gone, but Buffett said for the first time Saturday that Greg Abel should also take responsibility for the company's investments after he takes over, raising new questions about the succession plan. Abel put his encyclopedic knowledge of the utility business that he led directly for years on display and delved into railroad operations and potential acquisitions that Berkshire pursued while sharing the stage with Buffett all day. For his part, the 93-year-old billionaire showed investors he is still sharp. Abel pointed out that it required a major culture shift to get workers at PacifiCorp and the other utilities, who have long focused all their energy on keeping the lights on, to think about shutting the power down at times when the risk that their power lines could spark wildfires is too great. He also said BNSF railroad is working on getting “our cost structure right” after delivering disappointing results. Succession was clearly top of mind for many of the thousands of people who filled an Omaha arena to listen to the two men after last fall's death of Vice Chairman Charlie Munger. Buffett, Abel and Ajit Jain, Berkshire's other top executive who oversees the company's insurers, reassured investors that Berkshire's board spends plenty of time focused on “what would happen to the operation if I get hit by a truck,” as Jain put it. Finding the right replacement for any of the three of them will be important. Previously, Buffett had said that when Abel becomes CEO, investment managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, who's also taken on the responsibility of being Geico's CEO, would handle Berkshire's massive portfolio. But Buffett said Saturday that his thinking has evolved, and that “I would probably, knowing Greg, I would leave the capital allocation to Greg.\" And Buffett said because Abel understands businesses so well, he also understands stocks. But Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said a good business doesn't always make a good stock unless you get the timing and position size right, and there is an art to that. \"I think stock picking is hard. I don’t think it’s something you can just start doing and be good at it,\" Shanahan said. Abel does have a history of making multibillion-dollar deals when he was the head of Berkshire's utility unit for a decade, including the acquisitions of NV Energy and AltaLink, but he's never been a stock picker. Weschler and Combs might be able to help Abel get the timing right and find opportunities in the stock market, but Buffett didn't say that Saturday. Abel just reassured shareholders that \"the capital allocation principles that we use today will be maintained.” “Does that give you more or less confidence post-Buffett? I would say it’s got to give you less — not because it’s a worse circumstance — but because it hasn’t been very transparent and communicated that clearly. You’ve got to start asking, well, what else is going to change?” said Cole Smead with Smead Capital Management. Abel definitely has the confidence of the CEOs at all of Berkshire's many varied noninsurance businesses who report to him and ask his advice on any challenges they are facing. “Greg sees so much more than I do on a daily basis. So his perspective is valued, and his wisdom is something that is such a luxury for all of us to be able to tap into,” said Dan Sheridan, who just became CEO of Brooks Running this year after his predecessor retired. He said Abel is always humble and curious about the business, even while asking challenging questions. See's Candies CEO Pat Egan added that Abel reflects all of Berkshire's core values, with the company's emphasis on integrity, taking care of customers and strengthening brands, while still giving Berkshire's subsidiaries the freedom to operate independently. “He really expects us to know our business, understand the parameters, and to run our business on a day to day basis,” said Tim Baucom, CEO of flooring giant Shaw Industries. “So I feel like I have all the freedom of the world, but with freedom comes responsibility.” The shareholders who attended the meeting and spent hours shopping and talking with executives at the booths Berkshire subsidiaries set up when they weren't listening to Buffett and Abel remain confident.

    "content": "This year’s Berkshire Hathaway meeting gave shareholders their best chance yet to hear from the man who will one day take over as CEO when Warren Buffett is gone This year's Berkshire Hathaway meeting gave shareholders their best chance yet to hear from the man who will one day take over as CEO when Warren Buffett is gone, but Buffett said for the first time Saturday that Greg Abel should also take responsibility for the company's investments after he takes over, raising new questions about the succession plan. Abel put his encyclopedic knowledge of the utility business that he led directly for years on display and delved into railroad operations and potential acquisitions that Berkshire pursued while sharing the stage with Buffett all day. For his part, the 93-year-old billionaire showed investors he is still sharp. Abel pointed out that it required a major culture shift to get workers at PacifiCorp and the other utilities, who have long focused all their energy on keeping the lights on, to think about shutting the power down at times when the risk that their power lines could spark wildfires is too great. He also said BNSF railroad is working on getting “our cost structure right” after delivering disappointing results. Succession was clearly top of mind for many of the thousands of people who filled an Omaha arena to listen to the two men after last fall's death of Vice Chairman Charlie Munger. Buffett, Abel and Ajit Jain, Berkshire's other top executive who oversees the company's insurers, reassured investors that Berkshire's board spends plenty of time focused on “what would happen to the operation if I get hit by a truck,” as Jain put it. Finding the right replacement for any of the three of them will be important. Previously, Buffett had said that when Abel becomes CEO, investment managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, who's also taken on the responsibility of being Geico's CEO, would handle Berkshire's massive portfolio. But Buffett said Saturday that his thinking has evolved, and that “I would probably, knowing Greg, I would leave the capital allocation to Greg.\" And Buffett said because Abel understands businesses so well, he also understands stocks. But Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said a good business doesn't always make a good stock unless you get the timing and position size right, and there is an art to that. \"I think stock picking is hard. I don’t think it’s something you can just start doing and be good at it,\" Shanahan said. Abel does have a history of making multibillion-dollar deals when he was the head of Berkshire's utility unit for a decade, including the acquisitions of NV Energy and AltaLink, but he's never been a stock picker. Weschler and Combs might be able to help Abel get the timing right and find opportunities in the stock market, but Buffett didn't say that Saturday. Abel just reassured shareholders that \"the capital allocation principles that we use today will be maintained.” “Does that give you more or less confidence post-Buffett? I would say it’s got to give you less — not because it’s a worse circumstance — but because it hasn’t been very transparent and communicated that clearly. You’ve got to start asking, well, what else is going to change?” said Cole Smead with Smead Capital Management. Abel definitely has the confidence of the CEOs at all of Berkshire's many varied noninsurance businesses who report to him and ask his advice on any challenges they are facing. “Greg sees so much more than I do on a daily basis. So his perspective is valued, and his wisdom is something that is such a luxury for all of us to be able to tap into,” said Dan Sheridan, who just became CEO of Brooks Running this year after his predecessor retired. He said Abel is always humble and curious about the business, even while asking challenging questions. See's Candies CEO Pat Egan added that Abel reflects all of Berkshire's core values, with the company's emphasis on integrity, taking care of customers and strengthening brands, while still giving Berkshire's subsidiaries the freedom to operate independently. “He really expects us to know our business, understand the parameters, and to run our business on a day to day basis,” said Tim Baucom, CEO of flooring giant Shaw Industries. “So I feel like I have all the freedom of the world, but with freedom comes responsibility.” The shareholders who attended the meeting and spent hours shopping and talking with executives at the booths Berkshire subsidiaries set up when they weren't listening to Buffett and Abel remain confident. Some of them even got the chance to take selfies with Abel, though Buffett no longer tours the exhibit hall in public. “I think they'll be fine,” said Michael Grizzard, who made the trip to Omaha from Richmond, Virginia, for the second time. “They're in good hands, and I think they have a good culture.” Smead said even Buffett, who is easily one of the greatest investors the world has ever seen, has been having a hard time lately finding good investments big enough to make a difference at Berkshire except for the $135 billion Apple stake that remains its largest investment even after some trimming this year.

    "content": "Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has cut its stake in Apple, apparently for tax reasons. The conglomerate’s first quarter earnings report — released Saturday — showed the company’s investment in the tech giant at $135 billion.  A report by CNBC noted this would mark a drop of 13%, though Apple remains Berkshire Hathaway’s largest holding, and that this was the second quarter in a row that it has reduced its stake in the company. During a question-and-answer session at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Buffet seemed to suggest that the sale was for tax reasons following sizable gains, the CNBC report said, noting that the billionaire also implied the sale could be related to him wanting to escape a higher tax bill if rates go higher to cover a rising U.S. fiscal deficit. “It doesn’t bother me in the least to write that check and I would really hope with all that America’s done for all of you, it shouldn’t bother you that we do it and if I’m doing it at 21% this year and we’re doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don’t think you’ll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year,” Buffett said. The news came on the heels of Apple’s quarterly earnings call, one which — PYMNTS wrote — spurred “investors to breathe a sigh of relief,” as the company posted a 4% dip in sales that was better than what some observers had feared, and the tech giant showed progress in its artificial intelligence (AI) efforts. “We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in generative AI,” said CEO Tim Cook. “We are making significant investments, and we’re looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon.”  As PYMNTS wrote in a separate report, Apple is apparently in discussions with OpenAI over the potential integration of the startup’s GenAI capabilities into the iPhone. However, there have also been reports that Apple is in talks with Google to license its Gemini AI technology for new iPhone features.  “Apple is also working on its own AI systems. Company researchers have developed a new AI system to interpret ambiguous references and understand contextual cues. The system could also be used to improve voice recognition,” that report said. “A study by PYMNTS indicates consumer interest in voice technology, with 54% of respondents expressing a desire to use it more in the future due to its speed.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors."

    "content": "It was a packed house on Saturday for Berkshire Hathaway’s annual “Woodstock for Capitalists.” ... [+] (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) “I not only hope you come next year, I hope I come next year.” – Warren Buffett Berkshire Hathaway’s annual “Woodstock for Capitalists” was held on Saturday, May 4th. It was a packed house on Saturday, with additional attendees spurred on by the passing last year of Buffett’s long-time friend and Vice Chairman, Charlie Munger. Warren Buffett, CEO and Chairman, and Greg Abel, Vice Chairman of Non-insurance, answered questions from shareholders for over five hours. Ajit Jain, Vice Chairman of Insurance, joined in answering questions for the first part of the meeting. The traditional movie that opened the gathering focused on the memory of Charlie Munger, who died late last year at age 99. There is much more about the enduring legacy and wisdom of Charlie Munger here. As always, Buffett began by briefly reviewing first-quarter earnings. Operating earnings were a whopping 39% higher than last year’s same quarter, so it was a solid start to the year. Buffett reiterated that operating earnings are the “most descriptive” way to view Berkshire since it removes the short-term volatility of market fluctuations in the net earnings. He further predicted that higher yields and cash levels should lead to higher investment income in 2024. Still, investors should not automatically “multiply the insurance earnings by four” since storms and accompanying losses do occur. One of the biggest stories from the meeting was that Berkshire Hathaway sold some of its massive stake in Apple\nApple\n (AAPL) in the first quarter. Before this sale, Apple stock comprised over fifty percent of its publicly traded portfolio, but Berkshire remains Apple’s largest shareholder aside from index funds. Despite selling about thirteen percent of its stake, Buffett said it’s likely that Apple will remain the largest common stock holding at the end of the year. Buffett said that noted Berkshire holdings of American Express\nAmerican Express\n (AXP) and Coca-Cola\nCoca-Cola\n (KO) were “wonderful” businesses but said Apple is an even better one. Berkshire was a net seller of over $17 billion in publicly traded stocks. The Apple sale comprised most of the sales, but it does look like there was some trimming of the Chevron\nChevron\n (CVX) stake. There will be more details in the upcoming 13F filing, which may also shed light on some of the purchases and the mystery stock purchased over the last few quarters. Between the stock sales and robust earnings, Berkshire’s cash hoard has reached over $182 billion, which Buffett noted is likely to be at least $200 billion by the end of the second quarter. When asked why he hasn’t invested the cash, Buffett said, “I don’t think anyone sitting at this table has any idea how to use it effectively, and therefore we don’t use it.” Buffett added, “We only swing at pitches we like.” In the wake of Munger’s passing, there were several questions regarding succession when Buffett is no longer at the helm. While it was known that Greg Abel was in line to take over as chairman and CEO, Buffett indicated that it would be his preference for Abel to take over the ultimate responsibility for all capital allocation decisions, including stock picking. Buffett noted that this decision would ultimately be up to the board since he would be gone. Buffett provided a simple but crucial blueprint for the goal of Berkshire’s management. The first goal would be to “increase operating earnings.” Secondly, “decrease shares outstanding,” which would boost operating earnings per share at a faster rate. Lastly, “hope for an occasional big opportunity,” allowing for a sizable investment of cash at an attractive expected return. This blueprint can be a powerful lens through which to analyze how Berkshire will perform in the future, both in the coming quarters and after Buffett can no longer lead the company.

    "published_at": "2024-05-05T19:13:09Z",
    "content": "Muchos famosos han decidido convertirse en enemigos directos de Bitcoin - Imagen generada mediante Dall-E, de OpenAI. Cuando me preguntan qué música me gusta, frecuentemente suelo responder “la de los años ‘80”. No es lo único que me agrada o escucho, pero siendo sincero, no suelo identificarme con lo que escuchan la mayoría de las personas de mi edad.  Cada uno tiene su opinión y sus gustos. Ahora bien, mantener postura de ataque constante contra eso que no te gusta, podría estar manifestando que hay algo detrás.  Con Bitcoin sucede algo similar. Más aun hablando de un software de código abierto que pone en jaque al sistema financiero tradicional.  Hay dos motivos que explican este comportamiento por parte de un individuo:  No hay mucho más que eso.  Aprovecho para traerte seis personas famosas de diferentes carreras y rubros que han decidido darle la espalda a Bitcoin. Puede que desde siempre o que, a partir de algún momento específico, hayan cambiado su discurso, resultando esto último más llamativo aún.  Voy a anticiparme: como el listado total en mi mente es grande, veremos de continuar con una segunda parte de más nombres. Así que, si percibís que algunos detractores clásicos faltan, ¡será porque vendrán luego recargados!  Y ya que estamos con la música, te recomiendo continuar esta lectura escuchando la versión instrumental de Woke Up This Morning, la intro de la gran serie de Los Soprano. Le dará un toque mágico.  Economista estadounidense. Detractor de Internet a principios de los 2000, creyendo que tendría el mismo impacto que el fax. Premio Nobel de Economía desde octubre 2008, mes clave para todo bitcoiner. ¿Lo tenías? Bueno. Sigue dando sorpresas.  En infinidad de entrevistas, como redactor del New York Times, ha mencionado a Bitcoin despectivamente, incluso creando una nota con el nombre de Bitcoin Is Evil (traducido sería algo así como “Bitcoin es el mal” o “malvado”). Para él, no tiene fundamentales sólidos, es meramente especulativo como una burbuja y es utilizado únicamente para operaciones ilícitas.  En una entrevista en Business Insider, ha mencionado que “el dinero fiat tiene valor porque está respaldado por hombres con armas”, mientras que Bitcoin no, y por ello no tiene ningún valor.   Y aunque teníamos esperanza de que se apiadara un poco de la red descentralizada luego de que Venmo, el servicio de pagos estadounidense, lo pusiera en su lista negra en 2023, fue simplemente una falsa alarma.  ¿Será cierto que realmente se ha perdido de acumular, aunque sea, algo de BTC en todo este tiempo, habiéndolo conocido desde sus inicios?  Hombre de negocios. Multimillonario. Pocas veces se lo ve con vestimenta informal. Suele gritar mucho y más de una vez te habrá aparecido en redes sociales dando consejos financieros y de desarrollo personal extremos en extractos de conferencias que ha dado alrededor del mundo.  ¿Y qué ha dicho sobre Bitcoin? Depende del día. En ocasiones ha mencionado que “el mismísimo Vladimir Putin es su creador, a través de una conspiración para destruir la economía de los Estados Unidos en el mundo”. Otras veces se ha mostrado misterioso diciendo que “cuando salga a la luz el verdadero creador, bitcoin se irá a cero, ¡en un microsegundo!”.  Además, ha mencionado que “anunció con exactitud” la caída de BTC a luego del ATH de 2017 y “nadie lo escuchó”. Al parecer, no pudo predecir el ATH de 2021 ni el de este 2024.  “Veneno para ratas”. Así es como ha definido en múltiples ocasiones a Bitcoin el referente de Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett, quien supo mantenerse en el top ten de las personas más ricas del mundo por décadas, según el ranking de la revista Forbes.  Recientemente, ha perdido a su mano derecha, Charlie Munger, a poco de cumplir cien años que, por cierto, se había pronunciado de forma similar sobre Bitcoin.  Alega que bitcoin (con minúscula) no es una acción de empresa, no es un título de deuda, no es un commodity ni ningún otro tipo de título valor, por lo que no representa nada más que especulación.  Por ahí se dice que el Oráculo de Omaha nunca invierte en cosas que no entiende, y este podría ser el caso. ¡Para qué arriesgarse ahora a sus 93 años!  Actual secretaria del Tesoro de EE. UU., habiendo sido presidente y vicepresidente del Sistema de la Reserva Federal del mismo país.  Fue partícipe indirecta de uno de los grandes memes de Bitcoin derivados del cartel de “Buy Bitcoin” a sus espaldas, cuando se oponía a auditar la FED en el Capitolio de EE. UU. durante 2017. Recientemente, el cartel se subastó en más de 1 millón de dólares en BTC.  Regalándonos algunos hits como el de “Beenance” (cuando quiso nombrar a Binance, en la causa en la que CZ se alejó del cargo de CEO del exchange), Yellen ha buscado múltiples oportunidades para denigrar a Bitcoin y al mercado de las criptomonedas en sus discursos, tildándolos de altamente peligrosos y especulativos.  Pero parece que hay luz al final del camino: ha reconocido que Bitcoin “podría representar una mejora en ciertos aspectos del sistema financiero”. ¡Quién sabe!  Este es uno de los casos más llamativos, del grupo de esos que hablaban bien de Bitcoin y de pronto dejaron de hacerlo. Mejor dicho: más que “dejaron de hacerlo”, empezaron a hablar mal. Pero muy mal.  Les presento a Nassim Taleb, investigador libanés, autor del exitoso libro El Cisne Negro en 2007, con el cual se dice que predijo la crisis mundial del 2008.  Su relación con Bitcoin ha sido conflictiva, ya que pasó de escribir el prólogo de “El Patrón Bitcoin” (bestseller de Saifedean Ammous) a emitir comentarios tales como: “El bitcoin es un tumor financiero que desaparecerá”.  Su cambio de postura fue radical y ha resultado de gran sorpresa y motivo de crítica por parte de la comunidad bitcoiner.  Aquí un post de 2021 mostrando su “nueva” opinión sobre el tema:  La actual presidente del Banco Central Europeo y ex titular del Fondo Monetario Internacional, Christine Lagarde, no puede faltar en esta lista.  Conocida por ocupar cargos de gran relevancia en organismos internacionales, por impulsar fuertemente el desarrollo de la CBDC de la Unión Europea (euro digital) y por tener un hijo que “supuestamente” perdió todo su dinero apostando a shitcoins en el mercado de las criptomonedas, Lagarde es un claro ícono del statu quo y del sistema financiero tradicional.  En ocasiones, ha hablado pestes sobre Bitcoin y las criptomonedas en general, haciendo hincapié en que no valen nada, que no tienen ningún tipo de sustento, que son activos altamente volátiles y su mercado debería ser fuertemente regulado para “evitar decepciones” como la que tuvo su hijo.  Sin dudas defiende su postura “pro-fiat”, intentando mejorar la reputación de un Banco Central que ya restringe operaciones en efectivo de determinados montos con el fin de eliminar el cash a largo plazo, aun cuando la autoridad monetaria lo desmiente.  Descargo de responsabilidad: Los puntos de vista y opiniones expresadas en este artículo pertenecen a su autor y no necesariamente reflejan aquellas de CriptoNoticias.

    "published_at": "2024-05-05T18:08:45Z",
    "content": "股神華倫．巴菲特（Warren Buffett）過去從不吝讚美蘋果，認為這是地球上最棒的事業，外界也公認蘋果是他所做過最成功的投資之一。然而，現在波克夏．海瑟威（Berkshire Hathaway，後稱波克夏 ）持有的大量蘋果股份，卻可能成為燙手山芋。 目前波克夏持有蘋果5.9%股份，整體約有1,570億美元，整整占了公司投資組合近42％，並估計藉由投資蘋果獲利多達1,350億美元。且根據投資公司Cheviot Value Management計算，波克夏從蘋果獲得的年化報酬率超過26％，遠超過同時間標普500指數的12.9％漲幅。 《華爾街日報》指出，這可能是投資者或機構從單一股票賺到的最高紀錄，即使巴菲特長年在股市打滾，也沒有任何投資能夠與蘋果帶來的回報比擬。甚至巴菲特本人多次盛讚蘋果比任何投資都要來得好，後悔曾經賣出蘋果股票，並稱若要在蘋果跟汽車股之間取捨，那一定放棄汽車。   但現在蘋果遇到瓶頸了。隨著股市回暖，那斯達克、S&P 500等各個指數在今年都呈現上漲走勢，然而蘋果今年卻一度下滑約10％。 眾多問題影響到蘋果增長，好比說歐美對蘋果反壟斷審查越演越烈，要求放鬆對生態系的掌控；中國市場出現衰退，最新財報中大中華區（包含中港台）營收下滑8.1％至164億美元；還有在AI熱潮下動作相對緩慢這點，投資者也頗有微詞。 現在巴菲特已經高齡93歲，何時交棒、誰是接班人等問題成為外界關注焦點，繼任者該如何處理龐大的蘋果股份會是個難題。波克夏股東達倫．波拉克（Darren Pollock）認為，因為蘋果的市值較高，容易被監管單位盯上，加上成長速度也趨緩，現在持有蘋果股份風險變得更大，「至少投資者對蘋果的期望應該與前幾年不同，這可能影響波克夏的業績。」 過去巴菲特其實對蘋果並不感興趣，適合傳出過他有意做空蘋果的說法。另外2013年前副手查理．蒙格（Charlie Munger）也曾對外表示，很難想像有比蘋果更不適合波克夏的公司。巴菲特與蒙格一向偏好更穩健的投資選擇，加上曾在IBM身上吃過苦頭，因而對科技股敬而遠之。 不過在一次與同行的討論過程中，巴菲特得知了蘋果潛藏的巨大潛力，iPhone高達95％的用戶留存率更是讓他印象深刻。巴菲特也多次讚揚過iPhone驚人的用戶忠誠度，「我看到這個生態系有多強大，到了非比尋常的程度……（iPhone）是一款非常有黏著度的產品。」、「如果消費者必須在買第二輛車和iPhone擇其一時，他們會放棄買車。」   2016年，波克夏開始買入蘋果股票，雖然過程中也曾經賣出，但整體而言持股仍在持續增長，最近一次是在2023年第一季，一舉買入超過2,000萬股。蒙格曾說，他們對自己買得太慢有些懊惱，「我們應該買入更多蘋果股份。」 投資基金Pabrai Investment Fund創辦人帕布萊（Mohnish Pabrai）自認師承巴菲特，他對蘋果長期表現有些擔憂，認為佔據主導的科技公司很難一直維持龍頭地位，10到15年後。蘋果未必能像今天一樣具有優勢。 《華爾街日報》指出，巴菲特至今沒有大舉出售蘋果，一部分原因或許在於波克夏很難為這筆現金找到更好的用途。尤其波克夏目前手中並不缺現金，今年2月公佈的財報中，現金達到歷史新高的1,676億美元，還聲稱「找不到價格有吸引力的交易。」 資料來源：華爾街日報、benzinga、Barron's 延伸閱讀：巴菲特認錯、法拉利點出台灣經濟實力！全球4大CEO股東信，透露什麼投資訊息？ 責任編輯：李先泰 更多報導蘋果宣布史上最大庫藏股計畫，這代表什麼？Q2財報一次看：Mac、服務事業成大亮點股神傳奇副手蒙格論「波克夏系統」：以忠誠換忠誠，是怎麼創造雙贏的？ 看更多相關新聞稅收考量 巴菲特大砍13％蘋果持股巴菲特：AI詐騙恐成高成長產業股神巴菲特罕見投資失利 認賠影視巨頭派拉蒙巴菲特股東會談話重點一次看！暗示接班人選是他、淡化減持蘋果憂慮 [Newtalk新聞] 中國前首富、萬達集團創辦人王健林已脫手 15 座萬達廣場變現。上個月，萬達旗下又有一家公司轉讓，顯示王健林已出售位於北京的萬達總部。近日，社群媒體上傳出王健林「骨瘦如柴」的近照，以及兒子王思聰出境日本的照片，外界紛紛猜測王健林是否已經結清債務。 綜合媒體 4 月報導，萬達集團持續甩賣資產，甚至連集團總部所在大樓都不放過。4 月 9 日，北京萬達廣場實業有限公司發生股權變更，原全資股東大連萬達商業管理集團股份有限公司退出，新增股東坤華（天津）股權投資合夥企業，持股99.99%，為控股股東；坤元辰興（廈門）投資管理諮詢有限公司持股0.01%。 接手的坤華合夥人為新華人壽保險股份有限公司和中金資本運營有限公司，出資額人民幣 100 億元（約新台幣446億元），其中新華保險持股 99.9%，中金資本持股 0.1%。 Ｘ（前推特）網友@MonsterguySusu評論道：「王健林骨瘦如柴，全憑一口氣在硬撐，萬達始終在暴雷的邊緣，即便是他把萬達控制權轉讓，把核心資產賤賣，也沒有完全解除萬達的債務風險。但是，他兒子的風險解除了。五一節前把長安街的萬達廣場賣給中金資本後，王思聰 [NOWnews今日新聞]台北股市今（9）日早盤走勢相對震盪，不過午盤過後在權值股走低之下，終場收在最低點，下跌139.74點或0.68%，收在20560.77點，日K終結連3紅，成交量為4180.1... 台股8日黑翻紅，尾盤更靠台積電（2330）、聯發科（2454）奮力一拉，站上20,700關卡，向上挑戰歷史新高意圖濃烈，5月以來行情高檔震盪向上，市場看空也悄悄集結，統計至5月7日借券賣出餘額達到1,237萬張，創下歷史新高水位。法人表示，借券賣出餘額增加多、股價卻逆勢上漲的個股，有中信金（2891）、興富發（2542）、大同（2371）等16檔，遭軋空並有機會認錯回補及進一步推升行情。 台積電（2330）今（10）日舉行臨時董事會，會中通過配發2024年第一季現金股利每股4元，較上季的3.5元再調高，配息基準日訂為2024年9月18日，除息交易日則為2024年9月12日。 中國大陸51長假後復工潮啟動，上海運價指數下午可望上漲，貨櫃三雄包括萬海（2615）、陽明（2609）及近日有ETF換股利空的長榮（2603）今（10）早一度亮燈漲停，截至11點左右，3檔合爆逾50萬張巨量，中櫃（2613）及台驊（2635）也都亮燈，帶動航運指數飆漲6%，成台股第一強。專家曝原因，看航運漲勢「還在現在進行式」，資金往電子往航運走。 外資又落跑，今（9）日從台股提款207.82億元，衝擊台股，終場跌139點，觀察外資砍最多的標的，第一名是上市第一天的群益科技高息成長ETF（00946），00946、00944成分股也入榜。 [NOWnews今日新聞]台北股市今（9）日收在最低點，下跌139.74點或0.68%，收在20560.77點，日K終結連3紅，成交量為4180.13億元；三大法人合計賣超175.99億元。觀察三大法... 水泥雙雄 4 月營收月減 1 成 台泥併購效益挹注創同期高。 [FTNN新聞網]記者馮茵／台北報導在AI手機、AI伺服器、AIPC助燃下，電子權值股台積電（2330）、聯發科（2454）8日股價直衝，帶動大盤站回20,700.51點，法人分...

    "description": "On May 4, the company’s CEO Warren Buffett announced — while heaping praise on Apple after a weak Q2 report — a giant unloading of the iPhone maker’s shares.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-05T18:08:15Z",
    "content": "CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA - JUNE 05: Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks before the start of the Apple Worldwide ... [+] Developers Conference at its headquarters on June 05, 2023 in Cupertino, California. Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the annual WWDC23 developer conference. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Berkshire Hathaway owns a big position in Apple stock. On May 4, CEO Warren Buffett announced — while heaping praise on Apple after a weak Q2 report — a giant unloading of the iPhone maker’s shares, reported CNBC. Is Buffett praising the company to keep the price as high as possible as he unloads more of Apple? It’s hard to tell what he is thinking. However, with Apple revenues declining and the absence of concrete growth catalysts, the company’s declining free cash flow and limited balance sheet cash raise questions about whether it will issue more debt to help pay for the $110 billion stock buyback. I requested a comment from Apple and will update this post if I receive a reply. Meanwhile, after pumping Apple stock during Berkshire Hathaway’s May 4 shareholder meeting, Buffett would be wise to grab the opportunity created by Apple’s stock buyback to sell more of his stake. Berkshire Hathaway’s biggest individual stock holding has contracted in size during the last two quarters. After selling 10 million Apple shares in Q4 2023, Berkshire Hathaway’s first-quarter 2024 earnings report released on May 4 revealed a 13% drop in the investment company’s Apple stake — to a value of $135.4 billion — “implying around 790 million shares,” CNBC wrote. At the shareholder meeting, Buffett praised the iPhone designer — saying it is \"extremely likely\" Apple will stay Berkshire’s largest holding by year’s end, according to CNBC. If he is so fond of Apple, why did Buffett sell about 116 million shares in the first quarter? In response to shareholder questions, he suggested he was selling to avoid a higher tax bill in the future if tax rates increase to fund the U.S. fiscal deficit. Buffett told shareholders he was paying a 21% tax rate in 2024 and could pay “a little higher percentage later on,” reported CNBC. If Buffett was trying to maximize Berkshire’s after-tax proceeds from the company’s Apple stake, the tax rate would not be the only consideration. The direction of the iPhone designer’s stock — which rose 48% in 2023 and has fallen in 2024, CNBC wrote — would be another critical variable for Buffett to consider. This leaves the Oracle of Omaha to answer a simple question: Is Apple stock going higher? Apple stock seems poised to rise if the company’s quarterly performance and guidance exceed expectations. Apple shares lost 10% of their value in the first four months of the year, which reflects the company’s failure to beat and raise, as I wrote in an April 29 Forbes post. Nevertheless, I did expect Apple stock to rise — despite reporting disappointing results and guidance — due to a deus ex machina. That is what happened May 2 as Apple revenue fell by 4% and CEO Tim Cook changed the subject by announcing a big stock buyback and 4% dividend increase. On May 3, Apple’s $110 billion stock buyback announcement — the largest in the company’s history and 22% more than the year before, noted CNBC — helped send the iPhone-maker’s stock up 7.5%. Here are the key numbers:   Apple struck an optimistic note about the current quarter. The company expects double-digit, year-over-year percentage growth in iPad sales and continued high growth in Apple’s Services division, CFO Luca Maestri said in a May 2 earnings call, noted CNBC. Apple was excited about the potential for its Vision Pro virtual reality headset. “We’re only scratching the surface there so we couldn’t be more excited about our opportunity there,” Cook told investors. Sadly for investors, “the $3,500 device is expected to sell in low quantities,” wrote CNBC. Apple also pumped up expectations for the company’s artificial intelligence prospects. “We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era,” Cook told analysts in an earnings call. Since Apple stock could have fallen in the absence of a stock buyback, perhaps the company will need to continue to raise its buybacks in future quarters to offset declining revenue. In the latest quarter, Apple’s free cash flow fell 45% to $20.7 billion while the iPhone maker ended the quarter with $67.2 billion in cash and short-term investments, according to the Wall Street Journal. Since Apple’s $110 billion stock buyback exceeds its balance sheet cash, how will the iPhone maker pay for the share buyback? One possible way to do this is to do what Apple did before — issue bonds to pay for the buybacks and repay the bonds with profits stored in countries with 0% corporate tax rates. “In the case of Apple, the profits are kept offshore in 0% tax countries like Ireland. Then Apple issues bonds in the U.S. to finance these buybacks and when the bonds mature they use the offshore cash to repay them saving the 30% tax rate owed to uncle Sam,” noted a thread on Reddit. This idea is not completely far-fetched. In 2013, Apple avoided $9 billion in taxes by using the proceeds of a $17 billion bond issuance to pay shareholders rather than bringing back $100 billion in overseas cash where the effective tax rate was 2%, reported the Financial Times. Apple’s 2013 borrowing cost the company about $310 million annually but would yield an offsetting $100 million in annual tax credits. “There is a huge tax saving for Apple in borrowing the money rather than bringing it back to the U.S.,” Kevin Phillips, international tax partner at Baker Tilly, told the Financial Times. Whether Apple is still using this tactic to save on taxes is unclear. However, Apple’s latest effective tax rate was 15.8% — a significant savings over the 21% standard federal tax rate — “primarily due to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings,” according to Apple’s second quarter 10-Q filing. While Apple has not reported new bond issuance, the iPhone designer has sold bonds in the past to finance buybacks and dividends. For example, last May, Apple issued $5.25 billion in bonds after a $5.5 billion bond offering in August 2022, reported TheStreet. One financial expert is comfortable with Apple’s ability to finance stock buybacks. Apple “produces roughly $100 billion per year in free cash flow, and stock buybacks are usually over a longer period of time so as to not cause disruptions in the short-term price,” Babson College finance professor and colleague Mark Potter emailed me on May 5. There is no reason for Apple not to use its free cash flow for this purpose. “What else are they gonna spend their money on? If they put aside just 1/3 of the FCF for buybacks they can fund it out of operations,” Potter added. In short, Apple has used a combination of bonds and cash to pay for the stock buybacks and dividends. The company will probably continue with this strategy. Sadly, Apple’s declining revenue and failure to create world-changing new products suggest the company has lost its ability to invest for growth. Steve Jobs likely would be rolling in his grave if he could see how far Apple has deviated from his strategy of innovating the company’s way to success.  One Community.

    "content": "OMAHA, Neb. — Warren E. Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, presided over the company’s annual meeting on Saturday. At the meeting, Buffett offered insights into Berkshire’s recent reduction of its substantial stake in Apple. Speaking before thousands of shareholders in attendance, Buffett emphasized that the decision to sell was not a signal of lost confidence in the tech giant but rather a strategic move in the face of broader economic and tax considerations. During the first quarter of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway sold 115 million shares of Apple, its largest holding. Buffett, however, reassured investors that despite the sale, Apple would remain Berkshire’s largest common stock investment. “We have sold shares, and I would think it extremely likely that at the end of the year, Apple is still our largest common stock holding,” Buffett stated. Sherman Lamb, a 27-year-old Class B shareholder from Malaysia, noted that Buffett had excluded Apple from the list of Berkshire’s long-duration ownership positions, which included Coca-Cola and American Express. In response, Buffett reiterated Berkshire’s confidence in Apple, emphasizing that it remains a core business for the conglomerate. “We look at Coca-Cola, American Express, and Apple as businesses,” Buffett explained. “There’s a difference in tax factors, managerial responsibility, and other aspects, but we always look at every stock as a business.” He added that unless extraordinary circumstances arise, Berkshire will continue to hold substantial positions in Apple, American Express, and Coca-Cola for the foreseeable future. The decision to reduce Berkshire’s Apple stake aligns with Buffett’s broader strategy of building cash reserves amid economic uncertainties. The legendary investor highlighted that holding cash is advantageous when considering alternatives in the equity markets and the current global economic landscape. “When I look at the alternatives available in the equity markets and the global situation, we find holding cash quite attractive,” Buffett said. He noted that Berkshire doesn’t attempt to predict market movements or follow technical indicators, but instead focuses on assessing stocks as businesses and deploying capital accordingly. Buffett also delved into the sale’s tax implications. Berkshire Hathaway paid a 21% federal tax rate on the gains from its Apple stake reduction, a significant decrease from the 35% rate of past years. Buffett remains optimistic about Berkshire’s future tax contributions despite paying substantial taxes. “We don’t mind paying taxes at Berkshire, and we’re paying a 21% federal rate on the gains we’re taking in Apple,” Buffett noted. “It doesn’t bother me to write that check.” Buffett also acknowledged the potential for higher taxes given current fiscal policies. “Something has to give, and I think higher taxes are quite likely,” he said. “The government owns a part of the earnings of our businesses. They don’t own the assets but a percentage of the earnings.” While Berkshire reduced its Apple holdings, Buffett emphasized that the tech giant remains a valuable business. He noted that Apple’s services and ecosystem make it an exceptional company with a strong competitive edge. “Apple is a wonderful business, and we will own Apple, Coca-Cola, and American Express when Greg [Abel] takes over this place,” Buffett said, referring to Berkshire Hathaway’s vice-chairman. Despite selling a portion of Berkshire’s Apple holdings, Buffett maintained that Berkshire’s cash position and diversified portfolio ensure the company’s stability and continued growth. He stressed that the sale was driven more by prudent portfolio management than concerns about Apple’s prospects. “We think it’s appropriate that a country that has been as generous to our owners deserves that we pay substantial federal income taxes,” Buffett said, noting that Berkshire sent over $5 billion to the U.S. federal government last year. Reflecting on Berkshire’s overall investment approach, Buffett highlighted the importance of viewing stocks as businesses and avoiding market speculation. “Most things, if you keep working harder, you learn a little more math or physics,” Buffett said. “But with investments, you don’t have to do that.” He credited Benjamin Graham’s The Intelligent Investor for helping shape his investment philosophy. “If you look at stocks as businesses and treat the market as something that’s there to serve you rather than instruct you, you’ll do much better over time.” Despite reducing Berkshire’s Apple stake, Buffett remains confident in the company’s long-term strategy and core holdings. “We will end up, unless something dramatic happens, with Apple as our largest investment.” In his customary candid and measured style, Buffett reassured Berkshire shareholders that their investments are in good hands, even amid the uncertain economic climate.

    "content": "波克夏海瑟威（Berkshire Hathaway）於4日舉辦年度股東大會，「股神」巴菲特（Warren Buffett）針對集團的動向談到，未來將由副董事長亞伯（Greg Abel）完全接管投資決策，表明亞伯不只會監督併購行動，也會掌握股票投資組合。 波克夏4日在其總部所在地奧馬哈（Omaha）舉行股東會，為副董事長查理‧孟格（Charles T. Munger）去年離世後的首次股東會，活動中，波克夏用影片追悼孟格，巴菲特也向這位老戰友致敬。 有鑑於巴菲特今年已高齡93歲，外界關注其接班人選，他在會上表示，他清楚知道大家關注此事，但他自己感覺還能勝任這份工作。不過，巴菲特仍對於波克夏的未來透露了蛛絲馬跡。 巴菲特指出，他雖覺得自己狀況不錯，但對於預期壽命的精算表還是有一定程度的了解，投資人不需等待太久，便可以見證新一代管理階層將如何運作波克夏。 過往的股東會總是由孟格坐在巴菲特身旁，而今年則由兩位副董事長擔任此角色，分別是掌理波克夏非保險事業的亞伯，以及掌管波克夏保險事業的詹恩（Ajit Jain）。 其中，亞伯自2021年來便已受到巴菲特欽定。巴菲特當年5月向媒體透露，「如果今夜我出了什麼事，明天一早會由葛瑞格（亞伯）接手」，今年2月公布的致股東信中，巴菲特也曾提到，無論自哪方面看，亞伯都已做好明天就執掌波克夏的準備，使外界認定亞伯為巴菲特欽定的接班人。 巴菲特4日在回答股東提問時也直接闡明，當他不再執掌波克夏時，亞伯將對集團的投資決策擁有最終決定權，亦即未來股票投資組合相關的決策，都將由亞伯負責。亞伯於1992年進入波克夏，透過公司的公用事業業務晉升，因此對公司業務有充分了解，2018年時，他與詹恩一同升任副董事長，巴特此前曾透露，他在資本配置方面與亞伯有著相似的觀點。 巴菲特在股東會上表示，波克夏的資本配置應完全由亞伯來負責，他不希望有200個人每人管理10億美元，並強調「如果我是董事會成員，要做出決定，我可能會根據亞伯的決策」，「他（亞伯）非常了解企業。如果你了解企業，你就了解普通股」。 巴菲特補充談到，在他去世後，波克夏董事將會做出最終決定，並也幽默表示，「如果他們有不同的做法，我可能會回來纏著他們」。 J Stern ＆ Co的投資長羅斯巴赫（Christopher Rossbach）認為，巴菲特在本次股東會上的言論非常重要，因為其代表波克夏前進道路的一部分，並也未大家帶出了新的問題，包含亞伯將如何管理股票投資組合。 亞伯在波克夏過往的收購中曾扮演重要決策，包含2006年收購PacifiCorp以及2020年收購Dominion Energy公司旗下的液化天然氣業務等。 目前尚不清楚亞伯未來會自己管理普通股投資組合，或是讓投資經理進行交易並向他匯報。過去10年來，波克夏的兩位投資經理康布斯（Todd Combs）以及魏斯勒（Ted Weschler）一直協助巴菲特管理一部分的投資組合，有人猜測兩人未來也將接手巴菲特的部分工作。 亞伯4日在股東會上表示，在經歷任何轉型時，波克夏今天所遵循的資本配置原則都將繼續存在。

Most Read from Bloomberg Truce Talks Drag as Hamas Hits Israel Crossing in Deadly Attack France’s Macron Calls for Reset of Economic Ties With China Buffett Praises Apple After Trimming It, Drops Paramount Stake Treasury Rally Risks Running Into a $125 Billion Brick Wall Xi Begins Europe Tour in Paris as Macron Seeks to Reset Ties Berkshire reported a $135.4 billion holding in the iPhone maker at the end of the first quarter, down from $174.3 billion at the year end. The move quickly became one of the biggest topics as the meeting unfolded, even though Berkshire had sold some shares in Apple during the quarter before. Despite the sale, Apple is “even better” than American Express and Coca-Cola, which are “wonderful” businesses Berkshire also owns, Buffett told the crowd of thousands in Omaha. Unless something changes dramatically, Apple will remain its largest investment, he said, hinting that tax implications had motivated the sale. The iPhone may be one of the greatest products of all time, Buffett added. Apple has faced a slew of headwinds — a $2 billion antitrust fine, slumping sales in China and the scrapping of a decade-long car project among them. Shares in the company are down about 5% this year. The sale bolstered Berkshire’s cash pile, which climbed to a record $189 billion at the end of March. Given current market conditions — where rate cuts are uncertain, inflation remains elevated and geopolitical risks abound — Buffett said he didn’t mind amassing the cash and said it could reach $200 billion by the end of the quarter. The cash hoard also benefited from higher interest rates, earning $1.9 billion of interest income compared to $1.1 billion during the same quarter a year prior. Berkshire’s cash pile has grown amid a dearth of sizable deals. Buffett said on Saturday he’s been unable to find recent acquisitions that would “move the needle” for the firm. Investors took it as a sign of his view on the stock market, too. “Buffett is hoarding cash and therefore is bearish on the stock market,” said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management. “He is unlikely to apply those funds unless he has a chance to buy an entire company or there is a major market sell off of 30% or more.” Here are some other key takeaways from Berkshire’s annual meeting and earnings: Earnings Gain In a sign the US economy remained robust at the beginning of the year, the conglomerate’s collection of businesses - which include manufacturers, home builders, insurance companies and retailers — generated $11.2 billion of operating earnings, a 39% jump on the prior year. Improved results at its insurance businesses helped the increase, earning $2.6 billion versus $911 million in the same period last year. At its auto-insurer Geico, pre-tax profits more than doubled to $1.93 billion, reflecting higher average policy premiums and lower claims, Berkshire said in its earnings statement. The business swung to profitability last year following several quarters of consecutive losses. “There’s still work to be done, but in the meantime, we are not going to shrink,” Buffett said of Geico. Berkshire’s railroad unit BNSF reported an 8.3% decline in earnings from the prior period, which Berkshire said was down to “unfavorable changes in business mix” as well as lower fuel surcharge revenues. Climate, Wildfires Berkshire’s PacifiCorp recorded $2.4 billion of estimated pre-tax probable losses from wildfires that spread across Oregon and California. About $1.7 billion of that remains unpaid, Berkshire said in its earnings report. PacifiCorp faces liability claims from the blazes, and damages sought by plaintiffs in Oregon and California totaled approximately $7 billion at the end of the first quarter, Berkshire said. At its annual meeting, Greg Abel — Buffett’s appointed successor and vice chairman of Berkshire’s non-insurance operations — pointed to an additional claim for $30 billion that was filed last week, though he described it as “an incremental claim” to an existing lawsuit. The absence of Charlie Munger, Buffett’s long-time business partner who died in November age 99, cast a pall over the meeting, which kicked off with a tribute film featuring a highlight reel of Munger’s famously acerbic one-liners. Buffett said the two had a “lot of fun doing anything” — he referenced golf and tennis — but they had even more fun “with things that failed, because then we really had to work, and work our way out of them.” At one point, Buffett mistakenly called Abel “Charlie” when he turned to him, and answered a question from a young attendee about what he’d do if he had another day with to spend with Munger. Buffett answered that he would have spent it the same way as other days. “He went everywhere with his mind, and therefore he was not only interested in the world at 99, but the world was interested in him,” Buffett said of Munger. Succession Buffett referenced his own mortality throughout the day, as the question of succession arose repeatedly. The billionaire investor assured Berkshire’s shareholders that the company’s future was in good hands. Abel — who understands businesses “extremely well”— should take over Buffett’s capital allocation when he is no longer around, he said. “When you’ve got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me?” Buffett said, referring also to Ajit Jain, Berkshire’s vice chair of insurance operations. “It has worked out extremely well.” Buffett also kept invoking leadership changes at Apple, noting the strong leadership of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who took over for Steve Jobs. “Buffett made it very clear that the structure of the firm is in place,” said J. Dennis Jean-Jacques, founder and chief investment officer at Ocean Park Investments who first attended the meeting in 2000. “It’s going to become more important for shareholders to ensure the board of directors and managers keep the structure in tact — they are smart people and are not afraid to write to the CEO to let them know things are going wayward.” Paramount Global Berkshire also sold its position in Paramount Global at a loss, Buffett said, adding that he was responsible for the investment. The company has faced challenges as viewers shifted from traditional TV to online offerings and is currently the subject of takeover talks. “I did it all by myself, folks,” Buffett said.

    "content": "An der Generalversammlung von Berkshire Hathaway spricht Buffett über seine Nachfolger, die Endlichkeit des Lebens und die Gründe dafür, dass ihm seine hohen Bargeldreserven keine Sorgen bereiten. Dieses Mal ist alles anders. Die Generalversammlung von Berkshire Hathaway beginnt mit einem 30-minütigen Film über Charlie Munger. Es geht um seine Geburt, seinen Werdegang, seine Einschätzungen zur Weltgeschichte. Und es geht um die tiefe Freundschaft zu Warren Buffett. Der Film zeigt Batman und Robin, Dick und Doof, Ernie und Bert, unterlegt von trauriger Musik. Die Bilder sind eindeutig: Für Munger und Buffett war es eine kaum zu überhöhende Freundschaft, die nun vergangen ist. Im November vergangenen Jahres ist Munger 99-jährig verstorben. Sein Freund und Geschäftspartner Warren Buffett hat sich jetzt zum ersten Mal seit 46 Jahren ohne ihn den Fragen der Aktionäre stellen müssen.  Einer der Anwesenden ist Andrew, ein Bub, der Buffett fragt, was dieser denn tun würde, hätte er noch einen Tag mit Munger. Buffett lacht auf, dann schwelgt er in Erinnerungen. Dem kleinen Andrew sagt er: Man solle nicht bis zum letzten Tag warten, um seine Freunde zu sehen. Besser sei es, so viel Zeit wie möglich mit ihnen zu verbringen.  Buffett und Munger sind zwei Ausnahme-Investoren, welche die Investmentgesellschaft Berkshire Hathaway zu einem der grössten Unternehmen der USA machten. Buffett als CEO, Munger als stellvertretender Vorsitzender. Buffett betonte jedoch stets, dass der Erfolg seines Unternehmens massgeblich auf seinem Freund beruhe.  Die Generalversammlung von Berkshire Hathaway in Omaha, Nebraska, ist mit ihnen zum Kult geworden. Buffett und Munger sassen stets gemeinsam auf der Bühne, tranken Cola, assen Süssigkeiten und beantworteten die Fragen der Aktionäre. Sie gaben Investment-Tipps, Lebensratschläge und erzählten Witze. Irgendwann wurden Fan-Artikel verkauft, der Event bekam den Beinamen «Woodstock für Kapitalisten». An der Generalversammlung nahmen dieses Jahr 40 000 Aktionäre teil. Buffett vermisst seinen verstorbenen Freund. Immer wieder sagt er Phrasen wie «Charlie und ich» oder «Charlie sagte immer», dann führt er seine Gedanken aus, von denen er sicher ist, dass Charlie Munger sie gedacht hätte.  An der Generalversammlung blickt Buffett, selbst 93-jährig, in die Zukunft, auf eine Zeit, in der auch er gegangen sein wird. Auf der Bühne sitzen mit ihm seine designierten Nachfolger Ajit Jain und Greg Abel. Jain ist 72 Jahre alt und leitet die Versicherungssparte, die einen wichtigen Teil in Buffetts Unternehmenskonglomerat einnimmt. Abel ist 61 Jahre alt und ist stellvertretender Vorsitzender des übrigen Geschäfts. Schon 2021 hatte Buffett Abel als Nachfolger für seinen Chefposten vorgestellt. Buffett ist Geschäftsführer, Investmentchef und Verwaltungsratspräsident in einem. In Zukunft sollen diese Funktionen auf mehrere Personen aufgeteilt werden. Die Investmentmanager Todd Combs und Ted Weschler sollen die Aktiensparte verwalten, sein Sohn Howard Buffett als Verwaltungsratsvorsitzender die Firmenkultur erhalten. Buffett äussert den Wunsch, dass Abel in Zukunft das letzte Wort bei Investment-Entscheidungen hat. Letztlich werde aber der Verwaltungsrat von Berkshire über die Nachfolgeregelung entscheiden, sagt er. Darüber, ob sein Nachfolger so viel Entscheidungsmacht haben wird wie er. Buffett ist unter Investoren für seinen Eigensinn bekannt, mit dem er aber sehr erfolgreich ist. Mit seinen Investment-Entscheidungen hat er in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten die allgemeine Marktentwicklung deutlich übertroffen. Er versteht sich als Value-Investor, er investiert in Unternehmen, denen er eine solide wirtschaftliche Kraft zuspricht und deren Aktien er zu einem akzeptablen Preis kaufen kann. Doch davon findet Buffett anscheinend immer weniger. Die Bargeldreserven von Berkshire Hathaway sind auf ein Rekordhoch von 189 Milliarden Dollar gestiegen, Ende 2023 waren es noch 167 Milliarden Dollar gewesen, bis Juni könnten sie 200 Milliarden übersteigen, schätzt er am Samstag. Buffett kommentiert trocken: «Das stört mich nicht.» Er betont die zahlreichen Krisen auf der Welt. Einen Grossteil des Geldes hat er in US-Staatsanleihen mit kurzen Laufzeiten angelegt, für ein sehr geringes Risiko bekommt er dafür gegenwärtig über fünf Prozent Rendite. Mit diesem Vorgehen steigerte Buffett den operativen Gewinn (Ebit) des Unternehmens im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres im Vergleich zum Vorjahr um 39 Prozent auf 11,2 Milliarden Dollar. Der Umsatz wuchs um fünf Prozent auf 90 Milliarden Dollar. Für den Anstieg ist auch das Energiegeschäft von Berkshire Hathaway verantwortlich, das um 72 Prozent gewachsen ist.  Die am Samstag veröffentlichten Quartalszahlen zeigen ebenso, dass Buffett etwa 13 Prozent seiner Apple-Aktien verkauft hat, Ende März betrug der Wert aller Anteile noch 135 Milliarden Dollar.  Unter den anwesenden Gästen war am Samstag auch Apple-Chef Tim Cook. Er sei von Buffett einen Tag zuvor über die Verkäufe informiert worden, sagte Cook dem US-Fernsehsender CNBC. Apple kämpft gerade mit sinkenden Verkaufszahlen. Buffett begründet seine Entscheidung am Samstag nicht, er betont jedoch, weiterhin auf Apple zu setzen: «Wenn nichts wirklich Aussergewöhnliches passiert, wird Apple unser grösstes Investment bleiben.» Buffett ist ein grosser Fan von Apple, noch im Februar machte der iPhone-Hersteller mehr als 50 Prozent des gesamten Aktien-Portfolios von Berkshire Hathaway aus. Dann folgten die Bank of America (rund 10 Prozent), American Express (rund 8 Prozent) und Coca-Cola (rund 7 Prozent). Im Laufe des Samstags präsentiert sich Buffett auch als Philanthrop. Er sagt: «Unternehmen konzentrieren sich zu sehr darauf, keine Steuern zu bezahlen.» Diese seien jedoch wichtig für das Funktionieren des Gemeinwesens, Buffett spricht sich deshalb für höhere Steuern aus. Amerika stehe vor fiskalpolitischen Herausforderungen, doch es sei ein Land, das stets grosszügig zu seinen Bürgern gewesen sei. Würden grosse Unternehmen mehr zahlen, könnte das die Mittelschicht entlasten. Unternehmer sollten das gerne tun, denn: «Amerika ist das Land, in dem ich glücklich war. Berkshire hatte Glück, hier zu sein.» Schon in der Vergangenheit sorgte Buffett mit seinem Einsatz fürs Gemeinwohl für Aufmerksamkeit, mehr als 99 Prozent seines Vermögens sollen nach seinem Tod für caritative Zwecke verwendet werden. Seit 2006 spendete er fast 40 Milliarden Dollar an die «Bill und Melinda Gates»-Stiftung sowie fast 13 Milliarden Dollar an Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen.  Auf der Generalversammlung fragt ihn eine junge Frau, welchen Ratschlag er für das Leben habe. Einen Ratschlag, der so wichtig sei, dass ihn jeder hören sollte. Buffett denkt 20 Sekunden nach, seine Stimme stockt, dann sagt er: «Ich denke jetzt an Charlies Ratschläge.» Buffett erzählt: Wir sollten einen Job haben, den wir auch lieben würden, wenn wir ihn gar nicht brauchten. Wir sollten eine Person finden, mit der wir unser Leben teilen möchten. Wir sollten herausfinden, worauf wir in unserem Leben einmal zurückschauen möchten. Sobald wir uns darüber im Klaren seien, sollten wir sofort damit beginnen, uns auf den Weg zu machen.  Am Ende der fünfstündigen Generalversammlung wird Buffett sagen: «Ich hoffe nicht nur, dass Sie nächstes Jahr wiederkommen, ich hoffe auch, dass ich nächstes Jahr da sein werde.» Buffett ist sich seiner Endlichkeit bewusst. Von den Aktionären erhält er Standing Ovations. Der Applaus gilt ihm, er gilt aber auch Charlie Munger. "

    "content": "Auch Starinvestor Warren Buffett findet keine guten Aktien und hortet stattdessen Cash. Seine Anleger sorgt hingegen nur eines: Was kommt, wenn die Legende geht?  Routiniert, souverän aber doch sentimentaler als gewohnt hat die Investorenlegende Warren Buffett am Wochenende die Hauptversammlung des weltgrößten Konglomerats Berkshire Hathaway hinter sich gebracht. „Ich hoffe nicht nur, dass Sie nächstes Jahr wiederkommen, ich hoffe auch, dass ich nächstes Jahr wieder hier bin“, sagte der 93Jährige zu seinen 40.000  Anlegern, die zum traditionellen „Woodstock des Kapitalismus“ nach Omaha gepilgert waren. Es war das erste „Woodstock“ ohne seinen langjährigen Compagnon Charlie Munger, der im November knapp vor dessen hundertsten Geburtstag verstorben war. Gemeinsam haben die beiden Berkshire Hathaway von einer strauchelnden Textilfabrik zu einem welt- und industrieumspannenden Konzern gemacht, der in den ersten drei Monaten des Jahres 12,7 Milliarden Dollar Nettogewinn erwirtschaftet hat. Und so trieb die Investoren in Nebraska vor allem eine Frage um: Was passiert mit dieser Geldmaschine, wenn auch Warren Buffett nicht mehr ist?  "

Он прекрасно понимает, как работают разные виды бизнеса,— сообщил господин Баффетт на собрании акционеров Berkshire Hathaway.— А если вы понимаете, как работают разные виды бизнеса, вы поймете, что надо делать с акциями». Уоррен Баффетт начал поиски преемника еще в 2018 году. В числе потенциальных кандидатов СМИ, помимо Грега Абеля, называли и вице-президента по страховым операциям Аджита Джайна, которому в этом году исполняется 73 года. Кроме того, на посту вице-председателя правления оставался один из старейших компаньонов Баффетта — Чарли Мангер. В 2021 году стало известно, что преемником Баффетта, скорее всего, станет Грег Абель, а в прошлом году в возрасте 99 лет скончался Чарли Мангер.  «Я рассматривал разные варианты того, как управлять нашим бизнесом. И в конце концов пришел к тому, что основная ответственность должна лежать на одном человеке — генеральном директоре,— пояснил Баффетт.— Наши активы столь велики, что мы бы не хотели, чтобы 200 разных человек управляли каждый по одному миллиарду долларов». В настоящее время объем свободных денежных средств в распоряжении Berkshire Hathaway составляет $189 млрд, а объем активов под управлением — $347 млрд. «Я думаю, что для управления такими суммами надо обладать стратегическим видением того, как иметь дела с большими вещами,— добавил Уоррен Баффетт.— Я думаю, что эта ответственность должна быть на Греге».

    "title": "Джинн из бутылки, Apple и будущее Berkshire. Что сказал Баффет акционерам",
    "description": "В США прошло культовое событие для инвесторов — собрание акционеров Berkshire Hathaway. На этот раз фронтмен был только один — Уоррен Баффет, но из-за этого мероприятие не стало скучнее. Самое главное — в нашем материале.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-05T12:40:07Z",
    "content": "В ночь на 5 мая в американской Омахе, штат Небраска, прошло годовое собрание акционеров инвестиционного конгломерата Berkshire Hathaway, которое также называют «Вудстоком для капиталистов». Ежегодно оно привлекает тысячи инвесторов, которые хотят услышать мнение главы холдинга Уоррена Баффета и его многолетнего партнера, вице-председателя совета директоров Чарльза Мангера. Мангер скончался в возрасте 99 лет в ноябре 2023 года. На этом фоне более заметную роль в ходе собрания играл преемник Баффета на пост главы Berkshire Hathaway и CEO Berkshire Hathaway Energy Грег Абель. «РБК Инвестиции» отобрали лучше афоризмы. Перед началом сессии вопросов и ответов инвесторам показали небольшой фильм. Видео состояло из фрагментов появления Баффета в таких сериалах, как «Во все тяжкие», «Отчаянные домохозяйки» и «Офис», а также из ярких высказываний Мангера с предыдущих собраний. После этого шел видеоряд из знаменитых дуэтов — например, Джон Леннон и Пол Маккартни, Бэтмен и Роббин и даже Бивис и Батхед. В финале этой нарезки были размещены фотографии Уоррена Баффета и Чарли Мангера. А в зале присутствовали звездные гости из мира бизнеса, в частности основатель Microsoft Билл Гейтс и глава Apple Тим Кук. Один из главных трендов на американском фондовом рынке — искусственный интеллект. Ожидания развития этой технологии стали мощным драйвером роста для акций технологических компаний. Осенью 2023 года в венчурной компании Accel подсчитали, что за год только несколько IT-гигантов — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon и NVIDIA — увеличили свою совокупную рыночную стоимость на $2,4 трлн на фоне ажиотажа вокруг генеративного искусственного интеллекта. Уоррен Баффет признался, что ничего не понимает в этой сфере, но ИИ вызывает у него беспокойство. «В прошлом году я сказал, что мы выпустили джинна из бутылки, когда разработали ядерное оружие. […] Сила этого джинна чертовски меня пугает, и я не знаю, как вернуть этого джинна обратно в бутылку. А ИИ — это что-то похожее», — заявил Баффет. Он предупредил, что генеративный искусственный интеллект создает большие возможности для мошенничества. Баффет рассказал о случае, который заставил его немного понервничать. Инвестор недавно увидел видео с собой же, созданное с помощью искусственного интеллекта — он утверждает, что даже его дочь не cмогла бы найти отличия. Баффет пошутил, что уже готов был отправить деньги. «Очевидно, что у ИИ есть потенциал и для хороших дел, но… я думаю, как человек, который ни черта в этом не понимает, у него есть огромный потенциал добра и огромный потенциал вреда — и я просто не понимаю, чем это закончится», — заключил «оракул из Омахи». Уоррен Баффет прокомментировал также продажу акций Apple. В первом квартале Berkshire Hathaway сократила позицию примерно на 13%, продав более 100 млн акций. Кварталом ранее было продано еще чуть более 10 млн акций. Один из акционеров Berkshire Hathaway спросил, значит ли это, что Баффет пересмотрел свои взгляды на Apple. В ответе знаменитый инвестор указал, что с прибыли от инвестиций платится налог (сейчас 21%), но в будущем правительство США может пойти на его увеличение, чтобы профинансировать растущий дефицит бюджета. «И если в нынешнем году я буду делать это под 21%, а позже мы будем делать это под более высокий процент, не думаю, что вы будете возражать против того, что в этом году мы продали немного Apple», — сказал Баффет. В то же время он подтвердил свою приверженность Apple и заявил, что если не произойдет чего-то экстраординарного, компания, вероятно, останется крупнейшим холдингом в инвестиционном портфеле Berkshire Hathaway, когда последнюю возглавит Грег Абель. «Мы владеем акциями American Express, и это замечательный бизнес. Мы владеем акциями Coca-Cola, и это замечательный бизнес. И мы владеем акциями Apple, а это еще более замечательный бизнес», — заявил Баффет. По его мнению, многие люди, скорее, навсегда откажутся от возможности владеть вторым автомобилем, чем от iPhone. «Я знаю, что он значит для людей и как они его используют. И я думаю, что достаточно знаю о поведении покупателей. И это один из величайших продуктов — возможно, величайший продукт всех времен», — заявил Баффет. Генеральный директор Apple Тим Кук, который также присутствовал на собрании, рассказал CNBC, что знал о решении продать акции Apple и обсуждал этот вопрос с Баффетом. Тим Кук подчеркнул, что Berkshire Hathaway — это все еще крупнейший акционер Apple, а сама компания остается лидером по доле в портфеле конгломерата. По словам главы Apple, иметь в числе акционеров Berkshire Hathaway — это привилегия. Баффет сообщил, что Berkshire Hathaway окончательно продала акции Paramount. По его словам, инвестиции в эту компанию были полностью его идеей и на них Berkshire Hathaway потеряла «довольно много денег». Баффет начал сокращать позицию в Paramount еще в 2023 году, на конец года у Berkshire Hathaway был пакет акций стоимостью $936,5 млн. По данным WhaleWisdom, конгломерату на конец марта принадлежало почти 9,7% компании. По оценкам Barron's, Berkshire Hathaway покупала акции по цене более чем $30 за штуку, притом что на конец первого квартала бумаги стоили $11,77. В 2022 году котировки Paramount упали на 44%, а в этом году акции подешевели еще на 12,4%. Reuters среди негативных факторов для медиакомпании называет забастовку сценаристов в прошлом году, ситуацию на рекламном рынке и падение прибыли в сегменте кабельного телевидения. Баффет признался, что случай с Paramount заставил его сильнее задуматься о том, как люди проводят свободное время и какие есть основные принципы управления бизнесом в сфере развлечений, будь то спорт, кино или что-то еще. «Думаю, что я сейчас умнее, чем пару лет назад. Но также считаю, что я беднее, потому что приобрел знания в том виде, в котором приобрел», — сказал Баффет, подразумевая потери от покупки акций Paramount. В прежние годы Чарли Мангер много шутил, а их диалоги с Баффетом были изюминкой собрания. В этот раз в отсутствие Мангера ярких цитат было не так много, а тема Berkshire без Баффета стала одной из ключевых. О том, что Грег Абель, сейчас возглавляющий Berkshire Hathaway Energy, займет пост Баффета, было известно и ранее. Однако, как пишет CNBC, ходили спекуляции о том, кому будет принадлежать последнее слово при принятии инвестиционных решений. Баффет развеял все сомнения на этот счет, заявив, что передаст свои функции управления капиталом именно Абелю. При этом основным фактором при выборе преемника выступала величина портфеля Berkshire. По итогам первого квартала конгломерат накопил свободные средства в размере $189 млрд, а суммарная стоимость сделанных им финансовых инвестиций достигла $362 млрд (по текущим рыночным ценам). «Суммы в Berkshire выросли настолько, что мы не хотим иметь 200 человек, каждый из которых управлял бы активами на $1 млрд. Так это не работает», — отметил Баффет, добавив, что если человек разбирается в бизнесе, то разберется и в обыкновенных акциях. Абель известен своей экспертизой в энергетике, также он курирует в Berkshire такие направления, как железные дороги и розничная торговля. «Я кое-что понимаю в актуарных таблицах (используются в страховании для оценки наступления страхового случая, в том числе смерти. — “РБК Инвестиции”)», — пошутил глава холдинга, которому в августе исполнится 94 года. Также он подчеркнул, что с его самочувствием все в порядке. Сектор страхования занимает существенную долю в операционной прибыли Berkshire ($5,2 млрд из $11,22 млрд по состоянию на 31 марта 2024 года), а сам Баффет считает его «самым важным бизнесом Berkshire». В ходе собрания акционеры спросили о том, как найти другого Аджита Джейна — топ-менеджера, который привел это направление к успеху. Баффет ответил, что это невозможно, в то же время благодаря Джейну была создана такая операционная среда, которую невозможно скопировать. Абель добавил, что в компании действует корпоративная культура, в которой менеджеры обладают «мышлением собственников». По его мнению, это не изменится и продолжит привлекать талантливых управленцев в команду. Принципы инвестирования и в целом отношение к жизни — это отдельная тема на всех годовых собраниях Berkshire Hathaway. Например, год назад Баффет дал инвесторам несколько советов по управлению личными финансами: траты должны быть меньше, чем доход, свободные деньги обязательно нужно откладывать и инвестировать, не надо пользоваться заемными средствами, исключением может быть разве что ипотека. В этот раз он отметил, что за многие годы сделал немало ошибок, но в итоге пришел к понимаю того, насколько важен принцип, который красноречиво сформулирован в книге Бенджамина Грэма «Разумный инвестор»: «Если вы смотрите на акции как на бизнес и относитесь к рынку не как к чему-то, что дает вам инструкции, а служит вам, вы добьетесь большего успеха спустя какое-то время, чем если попытаетесь читать графики или слушать, что люди говорят про скользящие средние». По словам Баффета, принцип отношения к акции как к бизнесу лежал в основе таких инвестиций Berkshire, как Apple, Coca-Cola и American Express. Одним из эмоциональных моментов собрания стал вопрос мальчика 10−15 лет о том, что бы сделал Баффет, если бы у него была возможность провести еще один день с Чарли Мангером. Миллиардер ответил, что не надо ждать последнего дня, нужно чаще встречаться при жизни с человеком, который вам дорог. Партнеры познакомились в 1959 году и на долгие годы стали близкими друзьями. Баффет пустился в ностальгические размышления о том, что Мангер был гораздо более широким человеком в плане кругозора, а сам он — более узким. Инвестор отдельно подчеркнул, что понимание психологии — это очень важный фактор при принятии решений в Berkshire. Мангер умело анализировал бизнесы через призму человеческого поведения, напомнил Баффет. Также миллиардер отметил, что Мангер почти дожил до 100 лет, не беспокоясь о том, что он ест, и никогда не делая физических упражнений, кроме тех, что обязан был делать во время службы в армии. Однажды у Мангера спросили, с кем бы он хотел бы пообедать из интересных людей, живших на протяжении последних 2 тыс. лет, на что он ответил, что со всеми уже знаком. «Он встречался с самим Беном Франклином», — шутит Баффет и говорит, что его друг узнал обо всем из книг. Глава Berkshire считает важным для каждого выбирать правильных героев и друзей по жизни, а также жениться или выйти замуж таким образом, чтобы избранник стал надежным партнером. При этом более ранний тезис о следовании некрологу остается в силе: «вам нужно сначала написать свой некролог, а потом попытаться придумать, как соответствовать ему». Отвечая на вопрос о своих самых надежных советниках на сегодняшний день, Баффет сказал, что полностью доверяет детям и жене, «но это не значит, что я спрашиваю их, какие акции покупать». Баффет не стал раскрывать главную тайну Berkshire Hathaway последних месяцев. В 2023 году конгломерат два квартала подряд просил у SEC разрешения не сообщать информацию о покупке акций некоего бизнеса — вероятно, чтобы другие инвесторы не стали скупать бумаги вслед за Баффетом и не взвинтили тем самым котировки. Но нельзя исключать, что интрига разрешится уже совсем скоро — в середине мая Berkshire Hathaway должна раскрыть данные по сделкам в первом квартале. «РБК Инвестиции» будут изучать отчет."

    "content": "Charlie Munger के निधन के मद्देनजर Berkshire Hathaway की 2024 की वार्षिक बैठक एक मार्मिक श्रद्धांजलि के साथ शुरू हुई। इस दौरान एक शॉर्ट फिल्म दिखाई गई, जिसमें उनके जीवन का वर्णन किया गया था, जो छह दशकों से अधिक समय तक वॉरेन बफेट के दृढ़ मित्र और साथी रहे थे। यह केवल घटनाओं का स्मरण नहीं था, बल्कि मंगर की बुद्धि और ज्ञान का उत्सव था, जिसमें उनके वो कथन भी शामिल थे जो निवेश जगत में फेमस हो गए। जैसे ही दर्शकों ने उनकी प्रसिद्ध पंक्तियां जैसे \"अगर लोग इतनी बार गलत नहीं होते, तो हम इतने अमीर नहीं होते\" पर ठहाके लगाए, तो उस व्यक्ति के प्रति श्रद्धा की भावना स्पष्ट थी जिसने उनके जीवन पर एक अमिट छाप छोड़ी थी।  सामूहिक श्रद्धांजलि  जैसे ही फिल्म बंद हुई और लाइटें चालू की गईं, हजारों शेयरधारक अपने पैरों पर खड़े हो गए, जो लोगों के बीच एक दिग्गज को सामूहिक श्रद्धांजलि थी। वॉरेन बफे ने भावविभोर होकर एक बार फिर से बर्कशायर हैथवे के वास्तुकार के रूप में मंगर की सराहना की, जो इस बात का प्रमाण है कि उन्होंने मिलकर जिस समूह का निर्माण किया था, उस पर उनका कितना गहरा प्रभाव था।  प्रदर्शनी हॉल  एक मर्मस्पर्शी संकेत में, प्रदर्शनी हॉल के बुक स्टॉल पर केवल चार्ली की पुस्तक \"पुअर चार्लीज़ अलमनैक\" की कॉपी थीं। एक तख्ती पर लिखा था, \"मिस्टर बफे के अनुरोध पर और चार्ली के सम्मान में 2024 की वार्षिक बैठक में बेची गई एकमात्र पुस्तक पुअर चार्लीज अलमनैक: द विट एंड विजडम ऑफ चार्ल्स टी मुंगेर का नया वर्जन है।\"  वैल्यू इंवेस्टमेंट  लंबे समय से बर्कशायर के निवेशकों और दुनिया भर से वैल्यू इंवेस्टमेंट के प्रति उत्साही लोगों की भीड़ के बीच, वार्षिक बैठक में गमगीन लेकिन श्रद्धापूर्ण माहौल रहा। अधिकांश नियमित उपस्थित लोगों के लिए बर्कशायर वार्षिक बैठक सिर्फ एक वित्तीय कार्यक्रम से कहीं अधिक है; यह मूल्य निवेश के उन कालातीत सिद्धांतों के प्रति अपनी प्रतिबद्धता की पुष्टि करने की एक तीर्थयात्रा है जिसका बफे और मंगर ने अपने 60 वर्षों के शानदार करियर के दौरान समर्थन किया है।  कई बार उल्लेख किया  पूरी बैठक में मंगर की उपस्थिति बनी रही, दोनों के तौर-तरीकों का बार-बार उल्लेख किया गया और यहां तक कि बफ से भी गलती हुई, जिन्होंने ग्रेग एबेल को क्षण भर के लिए चार्ली के रूप में संबोधित किया। फिर भी, गलती होने से दूर, यह मंगर के स्थायी प्रभाव का एक मार्मिक अनुस्मारक था। हाबिल की दयालु प्रतिक्रिया, जिसमें गलती से उसे मंगर समझने का \"सम्मान\" स्वीकार किया गया, ने बर्कशायर परिवार के सांस भीतर उसके स्थान की पुष्टि करने का ही काम किया। डिस्क्लेमर: मनीकंट्रोल.कॉम पर दी गई राय एक्सपर्ट की निजी राय होती है। वेबसाइट या मैनेजमेंट इसके लिए जिम्मेदार नहीं है। यूजर्स को मनीकंट्रोल की सलाह है कि निवेश से जुड़ा कोई भी फैसला लेने से पहले सर्टिफाइड एक्सपर्ट की सलाह लें। Tags: #Charlie Munger #share markets First Published: May 05, 2024 5:40 PM हिंदी में शेयर बाजार,  स्टॉक मार्केट न्यूज़,  बिजनेस न्यूज़,  पर्सनल फाइनेंस और अन्य देश से जुड़ी खबरें सबसे पहले मनीकंट्रोल हिंदी पर पढ़ें. डेली मार्केट अपडेट के लिए Moneycontrol App  डाउनलोड करें। "

Lue lisää Uutistoimisto Reutersin mukaan 93-vuotias Warren Buffett ei ole toistaiseksi antanut viitteitä siitä, että olisi jäämässä sivuun yhtiön hallituksen johdosta. Warren Buffett saapui Berkshire Hathaway -sijoitusyhtiön yhtiökokoukseen perjantaina Omahassa.  Kuva: Scott Morgan / Reuters  Yhdysvaltalainen sijoittajalegenda, Berkshire Hathaway -sijoitusyhtiön hallituksen puheenjohtaja ja suuromistaja Warren Buffett vakuutteli viikonloppuna järjestetyssä yhtiökokouksessa, että hänen seuraajansa ovat valmiita luotsaamaan yhtiötä siinä vaiheessa kun hänen on aika siirtyä sivuun. Buffett totesi yhtiökokouksessa, että hallituksen nykyiset varapuheenjohtajat Greg Abel ja Ajit Jain ovat oikeita henkilöitä johtamaan yhtiötä, kertoo uutistoimisto Reuters. ”Miksi tyytyä minuun, kun vaihtoehtoina ovat myös Greg ja Ajit”, Buffett totesi. Toistaiseksi 93-vuotias Buffett ei uutistoimisto Reutersin mukaan antanut mitään viitteitä siitä, että olisi jäämässä sivuun yhtiön hallituksen johdosta. Päin vastoin hän vakuutti voivansa hyvin. Buffettin pitkäaikainen työpari ja Berkshire Hathawayn hallituksen varapuheenjohtaja Charlie Munger kuoli viime vuoden lopulla 99-vuotiaana. Matkapuhelimistaan tunnettu teknologiayhtiö Apple sai yhtiökokousviikonloppuna Buffettilta vuolaasti kehuja. Siitäkin huolimatta, että Berkshire Hathaway on keventänyt omistusosuuttaan Applesta huomattavasti viime vuodesta. Berkshire Hathaway ilmoitti myyneensä 13 prosenttia kaikista Applen osakkeistaan. Tämä tarkoittaa, että yhtiöllä on Applen osakkeissa kiinni noin 174 miljardin dollarin sijasta nyt noin 135 miljardia dollaria eli noin 125 miljardia euroa. Berkshire Hathaway sijoitti voimakkaasti Appleen vuonna 2016, vaikka perinteisesti Buffett on vierastanut teknologiayrityksiin sijoittamista. Applea Buffett kuitenkin piti ensisijaisesti kulutustavarayhtiönä, jolla on hyvä hinnoitteluvoima ja uskollinen asiakaskunta. Buffett vakuutti, että Apple tulee pysymään yhtiön suurimpana pörssisijoituksena siitä huolimatta, että osa sijoittajista on ollut huolissaan Applen suuresta painoarvosta Berkshire Hathawayn osakesalkussa. Osin Applen osakkeiden myynnin ansiosta Berkshire Hathawayn käteisvarat ovat ennätyssuuret ja saattavat Buffettin mukaan tällä vuosineljänneksellä ylittää jopa 200 miljardin dollarin rajapyykin. Buffettin mukaan yhtiö olisi valmis sijoittamaan varat, mikäli vastaan tulisi sopiva sijoituskohde. Osakemarkkinoiden korkeat hinnat ja geopoliittisten konfliktien aiheuttama epävarmuus rajoittavat kuitenkin tällä hetkellä Berkshire Hathawayn sijoitusintoa. ”Haluaisimme sijoittaa sen, mutta emme tee sitä ennen kuin löydämme kohteen, jossa on pienet riskit mutta josta voimme saada suuret tuotot”, Buffett totesi yhtiökokouksessa Reutersin mukaan."

    "description": "Dijo que la junta directiva de Berkshire tomaría en última instancia la decisión cuando él muera, aunque dijo que \"podría intentar volver y perseguirlos si lo hacen de manera diferente\".",

    "content": " Dolar: $925,30 | UF: $37.312,63 Indicadores Papel Digital Registro newsletter  papel digital Compartir Warren Buffett dijo que Greg Abel debería tener la decisión final sobre las inversiones en Berkshire Hathaway, dejando claro que su sucesor tendrá autoridad no sólo sobre las adquisiciones sino también sobre la gigantesca cartera de acciones del conglomerado en expansión. En la asamblea general anual de Berkshire en Omaha el sábado, Buffett dio su respuesta más directa hasta el momento sobre cómo se repartirán las responsabilidades entre el pequeño equipo ejecutivo que algún día liderará la compañía, entregando a Abel la responsabilidad de cómo se asignan cientos de miles de millones de dólares. \"Creo que la responsabilidad debería recaer enteramente en Greg\", dijo Buffett desde el escenario del Centro de Salud CHI en el centro de Omaha. \"Solía ​​pensar de manera diferente sobre cómo se manejaría eso, pero creo que la responsabilidad debería ser del director ejecutivo\". Dijo que la junta directiva de Berkshire tomaría en última instancia la decisión cuando él muera, aunque dijo que \"podría intentar volver y perseguirlos si lo hacen de manera diferente\".  Los inversionistas esperaban que Abel liderara las subsidiarias operativas de la compañía y fuera la persona que se encargara de la caza mayor de Berkshire, como se refiere Buffett a las adquisiciones multimillonarias con las que se ha hecho un nombre. Pero muchos habían anticipado que la cartera de acciones de Berkshire de US$ 336 mil millones  recaería en manos de los dos adjuntos de inversión de Buffett, Todd Combs y Ted Weschler, y que esos dos hombres podrían desempeñar un papel importante en cómo se utiliza el efectivo de US$ 189 mil millones de la compañía . \"Creo que el director ejecutivo debería ser alguien que pueda sopesar la compra de empresas, la compra de acciones y hacer todo tipo de cosas que puedan surgir en un momento en el que nadie más está dispuesto a moverse\", dijo. Abel ha desempeñado un papel importante en las adquisiciones de Berkshire, incluidas las adquisiciones de PacifiCorp en 2006 y el negocio de oleoductos de Dominion Energy en 2020. Buffett reveló durante la asamblea general anual que Abel también había desempeñado un papel en la oferta fallida de Berkshire por el distribuidor de tecnología Tech Data en 2019. No estaba claro si Abel querría administrar él mismo la cartera de acciones ordinarias o simplemente que los administradores de inversiones le reportaran, permitiéndoles realizar sus propias operaciones. El año pasado, Abel dijo a CNBC que Combs y Weschler administraban sus propias carteras \"y así será siempre, y las administrarán en consecuencia\". “Puedo preguntarles: 'Eso fue realmente interesante. ¿Qué desencadenó su interés?'”, dijo Abel sobre sus conversaciones con Combs y Weschler sobre sus inversiones en acciones. “Pero eso es todo. Y además de tener relaciones con ambos, que son importantes, ese es su portafolio”. En los últimos años, Buffett ha hablado de cómo comparte puntos de vista similares sobre la asignación de capital con Abel, quien ascendió en el negocio de servicios públicos de la compañía y ahora supervisa todas sus operaciones no relacionadas con seguros como vicepresidente. Añadió que su decisión estuvo influenciada por el gran tamaño de Berkshire. \"No queremos intentar tener 200 personas alrededor que gestionen mil millones de dólares cada una\". Christopher Rossbach, director de inversiones del accionista de Berkshire, J Stern & Co, dijo que el comentario de Buffett era \"muy significativo\" ya que mostraba \"parte del camino a seguir\". Añadió que esto generó nuevas preguntas, incluida cómo abordaría Abel la gestión de la cartera de acciones. \"Aún no hemos oído mucho de Greg sobre las inversiones públicas\", dijo Rossbach. \"Será parte de esta transición en curso, aprender más sobre cómo se estructurará ese negocio y luego también más sobre cómo piensa Greg Abel al respecto\". En comparación con años anteriores, Abel asumió un papel más importante en la reunión del sábado, la primera desde que el antiguo socio comercial de Buffett y vicepresidente de Berkshire, Charlie Munger, murió en noviembre. Buffett también entregó la parte oficial del día, cuando se votaron las propuestas de los accionistas, a Abel para que liderara, citando problemas con su propia voz y visión. Abel pasó el día sentado junto a Buffett en el escenario durante las sesiones de la mañana y de la tarde. El vicepresidente Ajit Jain , que dirige las operaciones de seguros, solo se unió durante la primera parte del día. Abel parecía relajado mientras hablaba sobre cómo se estaba desempeñando el ferrocarril BNSF, cómo Buffett había abordado su inversión en Occidental Petroleum, así como cómo estaba manejando los litigios sobre incendios forestales, incluido su impulso para que se aprobaran leyes estatales que limitarían sus responsabilidades en el futuro. catástrofes. “No queremos desperdiciar buen capital tras mal capital”, dijo Abel sobre el negocio de servicios públicos después de los incendios forestales, repitiendo un comentario que Buffett hizo en su carta anual en febrero. \"Allí seremos muy disciplinados\". Los inversionistas han visto a Abel como un fuerte operador de los negocios subyacentes de Berkshire, ayudando a mejorar los márgenes y la rentabilidad de la empresa, un punto que Buffett le atribuyó el sábado. \"Si tienes 20 hijos y eres muy rico, tendrás algunos que serán ambiciosos de todos modos y tendrás otros que no\", dijo Buffett. \"Somos una empresa muy, muy rica y no hemos tenido un historial de ser muy duros con las personas que se deslizaron\". \"Greg hará algo al respecto\", añadió. Al principio, Buffett se refirió erróneamente a Abel como \"Charlie\" cuando le hizo una pregunta. El estadio lleno, tan lleno que cientos de personas se sentaron detrás del escenario, incapaces de ver a Buffett en persona, estalló en un estruendoso aplauso. “Estoy tan acostumbrado a. . . ”, dijo, antes de reírse. “Ya me revisé un par de veces. Volveré a resbalar”. Cuando se le preguntó qué haría si tuviera un día más con Munger, Buffett respondió: “Nos divertimos mucho haciendo cualquier cosa. Jugábamos golf juntos. Jugábamos tenis juntos. Lo hicimos todo juntos . .. Nos divertimos tanto, tal vez incluso más hasta cierto punto, con cosas que fallaron porque entonces realmente tuvimos que trabajar”. La muerte de Munger enfatizó el hecho de que puede que no haya muchas más reuniones en las que participe Buffett. Dominic Evans, que viajó a Omaha desde Londres, hizo cola a las 4:45 am para poder conseguir un buen asiento. Dijo que quería venir a \"mostrar su apoyo\" a Buffett. “Sacad los pañuelos de papel para este año porque, ya sabéis, habéis perdido a alguien que es un gran maestro”, dijo. “Afortunadamente, gran parte de su material ya está disponible. . . pero, ya sabes, será irreemplazable”. Buffett reconoció su mortalidad varias veces el sábado. Les dijo a los accionistas: \"No sólo espero que vengan el año que viene, sino que espero venir el año que viene\".     Edificio Fundadores, Badajoz Nº 45,piso 10.

    "content": "      In the heart of America lies a modest, sleepy city called Omaha. It doesn't boast towering skyscrapers or bustling crowds like some of its metropolitan counterparts. But once a year, this unassuming city becomes a vibrant hub of activity, drawing people from all corners of the globe who get together here to attend the Berkshire Hathaway Annual General Meeting (AGM), hosted by one of the world’s best investor ever, Warren Buffett.    On Saturday, 4 May, I had the privilege of attending the AGM for the first time in my life, and it was an experience like no other. Sure, what attracted me the most to this year’s meeting was undeniably the chance to be in the same room as a legend like Buffett, and also to pay my tribute to Charlie Munger who passed away late last year. But what I did not expect was the sense of community that permeated every corner of the event.    Imagine being surrounded by friends and strangers alike, all brought together by a shared passion for learning and growth. As we waited in line to enter the venue under a light drizzle and chilly winds at 5 am, conversations sparked up effortlessly. People shared their experiences from past meetings, recounting memorable moments and the valuable lessons they had learned from Buffett and Munger. Some were attending the AGM for the first time, some for the 25th time.    And it wasn't just about the big names on stage. It was about the connections forged in the crowd, the camaraderie that made everyone feel like part of something bigger than themselves. In those moments, it didn't matter if you were a seasoned investor or a newcomer to the world of finance or investing. What mattered was the mutual respect and admiration for those who had paved the way before us.    As the day unfolded, I realized that the true charm of the Berkshire AGM lies not just in what Buffett or Munger have had to say on investing, business and life over the years, but in the connections made and the friendships formed. It's about coming together as a community, bound by a shared curiosity and a desire to grow.  Also Read: Wealth inequality: Give all Indians a stake in capitalism—literally     Jason Zweig,  noted American financial journalist and columnist for The Wall Street Journal, wrote this beautiful passage in an article in 2004 while sharing his experience of attending the Berkshire AGM: ﻿“Few things make humans feel worse than being alone. Buffett knows that no one wants to face the uncertainties of investing all by our lonesome. We want to be comforted and feel we’re part of a community. That’s the greatest gift he gives his investors: not massive wealth or brilliant insights but the deep-rooted solace of knowing that they belong, that they are in this together with others, that they are not alone.\"    It’s rare to find words that resonate deep within our souls. Yet, this profound passage from Jason, capturing the essence of Buffett and Munger’s impact on their followers, does just that. It speaks not merely of financial investments but delves deeper into the intrinsic human yearning for companionship and community.    Think of the countless individuals who arrive in Omaha in the first week of May every year, each from different walks of life, each carrying their own set of fears and aspirations. Yet, in that gathering, and in the wisdom of Buffett and Munger, they have found a common ground, a shared purpose. They have found stories of failures turned into lessons, and uncertainties turned into steadfast trust.  Also Read: How do noble proposals like an inheritance tax arise?     Even while this was my first time in Omaha, I have been a student of Buffett and Munger for years, and have come to understand that their ethos is not just about building wealth, but about building relationships and trust—or Munger’s “seamless web of deserved trust\"—and nurturing a community that thrives on mutual respect and shared growth. This ethos, when embraced, can diminish the pangs of loneliness and replace them with a comforting assurance that we are all in this together.    For me, like thousands of others who travelled thousands of miles to get a glimpse of Buffett speak at the ‘Woodstock of Capitalism,’ this was like a pilgrimage. And this pilgrimage was not about securing financial gain or getting ahead with insider tips. It was about the experience—being part of a community that values deep investing principles, long-term thinking, and the wisdom that comes from decades of experience.    In life, as in investing, it's not always about the immediate returns. Sometimes, the most valuable journeys are those taken for the joy they offer and the growth they foster. For me, attending the Berkshire AGM was about the sheer joy of being here, and the irreplaceable atmosphere of shared wisdom—a pilgrimage in the truest sense, to the mecca of wisdom, to an experience that proves that the while the world will always be full of smart and intelligent people, there would never be another Buffett, or another Munger.Vishal Khandelwal is the founder of SafalNiveshak.com \nMilestone Alert!\nLivemint tops charts as the fastest growing news website in the world 🌏 Click here  to know more.\n\n Unlock a world of Benefits!

    "content": "Der legendäre Investor lässt die Geldreserven von Berkshire Hathaway weiter wachsen – und legt Präferenzen für Nachfolgelösung offen. Sorgen macht dem 93-Jährigen das Betrugsrisiko bei Künstlicher Intelligenz.  Der legendäre US-Investor Warren Buffett findet keine attraktiven Anlageobjekte und lässt die Reserven seiner Holding auf Rekordwerte steigen. Mit Ende des vergangenen Quartals hatte Berkshire Hathaway rund 189 Milliarden Dollar (175,91 Mrd. Euro) an Bargeld und in kurzfristig angelegten Staatsanleihen zur Verfügung. Bei dem jährlichen Aktionärstreffen in Omaha am Samstag sagte Buffett, die Reserven dürften nach dem jetzigen Quartal auf über 200 Milliarden Dollar steigen. Buffett betonte, Berkshire würde das Geld gern angelegen, „aber wir werden es nur für etwas ausgeben, was geringes Risiko hat und uns eine Menge Geld bringen kann“. Berkshire Hathaway gehören unter anderem der Versicherer Geico, die Eisenbahngesellschaft BNSF und der Batteriehersteller Duracell. Das Versicherungsgeschäft war im vergangenen Quartal abermals ein Treiber für den Anstieg des operativen Gewinns auf 11,2 Milliarden Dollar von knapp 8,1 Milliarden Dollar im Vorjahresquartal. Der 93-jährige Buffett legte bei dem Treffen in einer prall gefüllten Sport- und Entertainmentarena auch seine Präferenzen für eine Nachfolgelösung offen. Wenn es nach ihm ginge, würde er das letzte Wort bei Investment-Entscheidungen seinem designierten Nachfolger, Greg Abel, überlassen, sagte Buffett. Letztlich werde aber der Verwaltungsrat von Berkshire über die Nachfolgeregelung entscheiden. Buffett hatte Abel, der aktuell das Energiegeschäft von Berkshire führt, bereits 2021 als seinen Nachfolger auf dem Chefposten vorgestellt. Offen ist jedoch, ob er genauso viel Entscheidungsmacht haben wird wie Buffett in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten. Buffett machte zugleich deutlich, dass er nicht an den Ruhestand denke. „Ich hoffe nicht nur, dass sie nächstes Jahr kommen, sondern ich hoffe, dass auch ich komme“, sagte er zum Abschied den Aktionären. Buffetts langjähriger Geschäftspartner Charlie Munger war im November im Alter von 99 Jahren gestorben - und am Samstag wurde mehrfach deutlich, wie sehr Buffett ihn vermisst. Im vergangenen Quartal stieß Berkshire die Beteiligung am Hollywood-Konzern Paramount komplett ab - mit Verlust, wie Buffett einräumte. Sowohl der Einstieg als auch Ausstieg seien seine Entscheidung gewesen, betonte er. Paramount ist aktuell in Turbulenzen wegen eines holprig laufenden Verkaufsversuchs, die Aktie fällt. Berkshire trennte sich auch von einem Teil der Apple-Beteiligung. Buffett machte aber klar, dass der Verkauf der Anteile Geld für Steuerzahlungen heben sollte und nicht mit einer Einschätzung der künftigen Kursentwicklung verbunden gewesen sei. Sorgen macht dem 93-Jährigen das Betrugsrisiko bei Künstlicher Intelligenz. Er verwies vor allem auf die Möglichkeit, täuschend echte künstliche Aufnahmen von Personen zu erstellen. „Künstliche Intelligenz hat enormes Potenzial, Gutes zu bringen - und auch enormes Potenzial, Schaden anzurichten“, sagte Buffett. Er wisse nicht, wie das ausgehen werde.  (APA/dpa)"

The death of Munger last year brought the question of succession to the forefront of many investors' minds at this year's shareholders meeting. At times, Buffett, who's about to turn 94 in August, seemed to mull over his own mortality, even as he said he was feeling fine to continue running the business. He spoke from the dais at Omaha, Nebraska's CHI Health Center, where the meeting was held, with his lieutenants Greg Abel, Berkshire Hathaway Energy chairman and Buffett's heir apparent, as well as Ajit Jain, vice chairman of insurance operations.  \"We'll see how the next management plays the game out at Berkshire, [but] fortunately you don't have too long to wait on that,\" Buffett said. \"I feel fine, but I know a little about actuarial tables.\"  \"I shouldn't be taking on any four-year employment contracts, like several people are doing in this world, at an age when you can't be quite that sure where you're going to be in four years,\" he added. The Oracle of Omaha provided more clarity than he'd had in the past on the leadership structure at Berkshire going forward, disclosing, for example, that Abel will have final say when it comes to the conglomerate's investing decisions.  \"I would leave the capital allocation to Greg and he understands businesses extremely well,\" Buffett said Saturday. \"If you understand businesses, you'll understand common stocks.\" Abel, in turn, reassured investors that the culture at Berkshire will remain the same, as well as attract new people going forward. \"I think we have a very special company at Berkshire,\" he said, adding, \"that's not going to change.\"  Munger's absence was felt deeply by many investors at this year's shareholder meeting. The business titan was known for his sharp wit and wisdom, and over the decades had drawn uproarious laughter from the crowd with his many humorous asides.  Some of those zingers and insights were highlighted in a video tribute at the start of this year's meeting. At the 2015 meeting, for example, he observed, \"Warren, if people weren't so often wrong we wouldn't be so rich.\" As the lights of the arena came on at the conclusion of the short movie, some tens of thousands of investors got to their feet for a standing ovation.  Buffett spoke often of Munger throughout the morning and afternoon sessions, referring to him as the \"architect\" of Berkshire's success. The two men shaped Berkshire into a $900 billion conglomerate from what had once been a textile mill. He also noted the characteristics he admired most in Munger, such as his honesty. \"When you get that in your life, you cherish those people and you sort of forget about the rest,\" he said.  At one point during the question-and-answer session, Buffett referred to Abel, who was sitting to his left, as the late Munger in a slip-up, prompting laughter from the crowd. \"I'm so used to that,\" admitted Buffett, who said he'd likely \"slip again\" during the meeting. Abel, who is Buffett's named successor, responded, \"It's a great honor.\"   Buffett also took some time to honor Carol Loomis, the financial journalist who had edited his shareholder letter from 1977, all the way to the most recent Berkshire report. \"Carol is the best business writer,\" Buffett said, adding, \"Nobody came close to her, and she started from scratch.\"  Despite the more solemn meeting, Buffett appeared intent to keep going for as long as he could at the helm. Addressing his shareholders at the conclusion of the 2024 shareholder meeting, the investor said: \"I not only hope you come next year. I hope I come next year.\"  — CNBC's Brian Evans, Alex Harring and Pia Singh contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Da sinistra: Warren Buffett e Greg Abel Si è tenuta nel pomeriggio di sabato 4 maggio l’assemblea generale di Berkshire Hathaway, la holding statunitense tra le più grandi del mondo. Anche stavolta il suo presidente e amministratore delegato, Warren Buffett (nonché ottavo uomo più ricco al mondo secondo la classifica dei miliardari di Forbes), ha riempito l’arena di Omaha, nello stato del Nebraska, con gli azionisti in attesa fin dalle 5 del mattino per assistere. Tra i tanti annunci, Buffet ha anche ribadito il ruolo di Greg Abel, confermandolo come suo successore nelle responsabilità non solo sugli acquisti ma anche nell’intero e davvero ampio portafoglio azionario (dal valore, secondo FT, di 336 miliardi di dollari). \n\n\n\n \n                    \n                    \n                di  Giuliana Ferraino, inviata a Davos \n\n Buffett è convinto. «Credo che la responsabilità spetti interamente a Greg», ha detto dal palco del Chi Health Center. «Sarà amministratore delegato». Ha poi affermato che se il consiglio di amministrazione della Berkshire prenderà una decisione diversa dopo la sua morte, «potrei cercare di tornare a perseguitarli». Greg Abel è un imprenditore originario del Canada. Dopo aver conseguito una laurea in contabilità presso l'università di Alberta nel 1984, ha iniziato il suo percorso professionale come commercialista presso l’ufficio di San Francisco di PricewaterhouseCoopers. Nel 1992 ha iniziato a lavorare per la società produttrice di energia elettrica, CalEnergy finché nel 2008 non è diventato ceo di MidAmerican Energy, una compagnia elettrica degli Stati Uniti medio occidentali. \n                    \n                    \n                di  Danilo Taino \n\n Abel è approvato nel gruppo Berkshire Hathaway circa dieci anni fa, nel 2014. In un primo momento ha lavorato per Berkshire Hathaway Energy (Bhe), una sussidiaria che genera e distribuisce elettricità prodotta anche da fonti naturali (comprese eolico e solare). Nel 2018 diventa un componente del consiglio d'amministrazione e vicepresidente con delega alle operazioni non assicurative. Nel 2021 Warren Buffett - che questo agosto compirà 94 anni - lo designa come suo successore e un anno dopo diventa amministratore delegato di Bhe (società valutata nel 2020 per una cifra oltre i 100 miliardi di dollari). Si stima che, per lavoro che svolge attualmente Berkshire Hathaway, il compenso annuale di Greg Abel ammonti a 19 milioni di dollari.   \n\n\n \nIscriviti alle newsletter di L'Economia\n \n\n\nLe idee di Ferruccio de Bortoli e Daniele Manca\nI fatti e le persone letti attraverso la lente dell'economia.\n \n\nWhatever it Takes di Federico Fubini\nLe sfide per l’economia e i mercati in un mondo instabile\n \n\nEurope Matters di Francesca Basso e Viviana Mazza\nL’Europa, gli Stati Uniti e l’Italia che contano, con le innovazioni e le decisioni importanti, ma anche le piccole storie di rilievo\n \n\nOne More Thing di Massimo Sideri\nDal mondo della scienza e dell’innovazione tecnologica le notizie che ci cambiano la vita (più di quanto crediamo)\n \nE non dimenticare le newsletter \n L'Economia Opinioni e L'Economia Ore 18\n\n 5 maggio 2024 ( modifica il 5 maggio 2024 | 12:36) \n            © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA\n         \n                            \n                                                            \n                                                    di  Redazione  Economia"

    "content": "\n\"L'intelligenza artificiale ha un enorme potenziale benefico, ma anche un enorme potenziale dannoso,\" ha affermato Warren Buffett\n Advertisement \na cura di\n\n\nAndrea Maiellano\n\n\n \nAuthor\n Warren Buffett, il celebre investitore e CEO di Berkshire Hathaway, ha recentemente espresso le sue preoccupazioni riguardo all'intelligenza artificiale, ammettendo di non essere un esperto del campo ma di essere comunque preoccupato per le implicazioni di questa tecnologia. Durante una sessione di domande e risposte alla conferenza annuale dei soci di Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett ha fatto un parallelo tra l'avvento dell'IA e quello delle armi nucleari. \n\nWarren Edward Buffett è un imprenditore, economista e filantropo statunitense, soprannominato «oracolo di Omaha» per la sua abilità di previsione negli investimenti.\n Ha ricordato un suo discorso precedente in cui aveva paragonato la bomba atomica al potere di possedere un genio della lampada, capace di fare \"alcune cose terribili con una semplicità disarmante\". Questo paragone suggerisce la sua preoccupazione per le potenziali conseguenze negative dell'IA, paragonabili alla devastazione causata dalle armi nucleari. Buffett ha evidenziato il fatto che l'IA è \"parzialmente fuori dalla lampada\" e che sarà inevitabilmente sfruttata da qualcuno in maniere dannose per il genere umano. Ha sottolineato l'importanza di comprendere le implicazioni etiche e sociali di questa tecnologia, evidenziando il suo potenziale sia positivo che negativo. Nonostante la sua ammissione di non essere molto familiare con l'IA, Buffett ha condiviso un'esperienza personale che lo ha reso nervoso riguardo a questa tecnologia. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ha raccontato di essere incappato in un video in cui la sua immagine era stata generata artificialmente e utilizzata per trasmettere un messaggio che non proveniva da lui. Questo episodio ha sollevato le sue preoccupazioni riguardo alla possibilità di utilizzo dell'IA per scopi fraudolenti. La conferenza annuale di Berkshire Hathaway, soprannominata \"Woodstock dei capitalisti\", è un evento molto atteso dai suoi soci, che aspettano tutto l'anno per avere la possibilità di ascoltare direttamente Buffett, conosciuto come l'Oracolo di Omaha. Durante l'evento, Buffett è stato affiancato dai vicepresidenti Ajit Jain e Greg Abel. Prima dell'inizio della conferenza, Berkshire Hathaway ha riportato risultati finanziari impressionanti, con una pila record di contanti e titoli di Stato pari a $189 miliardi e un aumento degli utili operativi del 39% su base annua a $11,22 miliardi. Questi dati indicano una solida posizione finanziaria dell'azienda e confermano il suo status di gigante nel settore degli investimenti. \n\nFonte dell'articolo: qz.com\n\n Non perdere gli\nultimi\naggiornamenti Advertisement \n \nTom's Hardware - Testata giornalistica associata all'USPI Unione Stampa Periodica\nItaliana,\nregistrata presso il Tribunale di Milano, nr. 285 del 9/9/2013 - Direttore: Andrea Ferrario\n\n3LABS S.R.L. • Via Dante 16 - Milano (MI) 20121\nCF/P.IVA: 04146420965 - REA: MI - 1729249 - Capitale Sociale: 10.000 euro\n\n© 2024 3Labs Srl.

Согласно квартальному отчету Berkshire Hathaway, в первые три месяца 2024 года конгломерат сократил долю в бигтехе почти на 13% — до 790 млн акций ($135,4 млрд). Об этом свидетельствует форма 10-Q, размещенная на сайте компании.\n Это уже второй квартал подряд, когда «оракул из Омахи» избавляется от бумаг Apple, отметило CNBC.\n Одна из причин — ухудшение финансовых показателей эмитента. По итогам первого квартала Apple зафиксировала снижение выручки и прибыли. Вместе с тем мультипликатор P/E превысил 27х — достаточно высокий уровень. Чтобы поддержать котировки, Apple объявила об обратном выкупе акций на рекордные $110 млрд.\n Сам Баффет ранее предупреждал о замедлении роста экономики США и своих компаний. Тем не менее операционная прибыль Berkshire в январе — марте взлетела на 39% в годовом выражении — до $11,22 млрд, что стало историческим максимумом.

    "content": "By Jonathan Stempel OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - The new chief executive of Brooks Running said the running shoe maker owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway views China and Europe as growth areas for a business that generates most revenue in the U.S. Dan Sheridan, who became chief executive on April 26, said in an interview at Berkshire's annual shareholder weekend that Brooks plans to open its first store in China this fall in Shanghai, with possibly more later. \"China is a top-10 market for running participation,\" he said on Friday. \"This is a 30- to 50-year strategy for Brooks. We're in this for the long haul.\" European markets are starting to revive after the Russia-Ukraine war and rising energy costs caused consumers to pull back, while retailers struggled with excess inventory and falling margins. Sheridan, 51, said the number of runners globally could double by 2031. He believes 110-year-old Brooks is well-positioned to capture sales with 300 million people running or walking as their main fitness activity. \"When you look at the opportunities for this brand, and trends that underpin those opportunities, it's easy to be excited in our growth and our future,\" he said.Sheridan succeeded Jim Weber, who led Brooks for 23 years and took the brand from near bankruptcy to $1.2 billion in revenue. Weber, 64, stepped back primarily for health reasons. The new CEO joined Brooks in 1998 and has spent his entire career there, becoming chief operating officer in 2019 and president in 2022. The Seattle-based company commands an industry-leading 21% U.S. market share in adult performance running shoes, according to Circana/Retail Tracking Service, with its Ghost and Adrenaline GTS the top sellers. NEW PRODUCTS Brooks, which derives 85% of revenue from the U.S., focuses on the top of the market. \"The right way for us to win the runner is through a science-based approach matched with great design,\" Sheridan said. Pandemic-fueled growth in running has helped support pricing, he said. The average retail price for performance running shoes rose 11% in a little over a year, to an average $87 in the U.S. Inflation pressures and supply chain problems are moderating as well, he said. Most Brooks' shoes are made in Vietnam, with a small percentage coming from Indonesia. Those supply chain snags disrupted the company's annual and semi-annual product launch cycles. \"That took almost $150 million out of our revenue annually. We're back to a full assortment of product and a full playbook,\" he said. The latest innovation: nitrogen-infused cushioning in the $160 Glycerin 21, which Sheridan says dampens impact but returns energy to the runner.

    "content": "Seoul—one of the safest cities for millennial travelers—at sunset. Searching for the safest places to travel? Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection (BHTP) recently unveiled its annual State of Travel Insurance Safest Destinations report, which ranks the world’s 15 safest cities to travel. This year, two U.S. cities made the list, with Honolulu named the safest city in the world. “BHTP’s State of Travel Insurance Safest Destinations report is unique in its ability to pair firsthand, survey respondent experiences with valuable third-party sources in order to identify its annual list of Safest Destinations,” Carol Mueller, vice president at BHTP told me in an interview. “Only travelers who have actually been to the cities are allowed to rank them on a variety of safety measures, using their first-hand knowledge as a yardstick.” In addition to surveying actual travelers who have visited the cities, BHTP analyzes several third-party data sources—including the U.S. State Department, The Economist and more—to evaluate safety concerns such as terrorism, weather emergencies, health measures and the safety of underrepresented groups. Over the past four years, the report has witnessed notable changes, reflecting the evolving travel landscape. While Scandinavian nations and Northern Europe traditionally dominated the list, this year’s report showcases a diverse lineup, with Asian and South American cities making their mark. Honolulu, which has been named the safest city in the world on a new report. For 2024, Honolulu claims the coveted first spot. Despite its vulnerability to natural disasters, Honolulu impresses travelers with its overall safety, making it an ideal travel destination. “Even Honolulu’s lowest marks are the highest of any destination in that category,” says Mueller. “Though the island’s volcanic origin and location in the Pacific make it an obvious target for a variety of natural disasters, from wildfires to typhoons, surveyed travelers perceive Honolulu as an incredibly safe destination for their tropical vacations.” Coming in second on the list is Montreal. The Canadian city is recognized—above all—for its transportation safety, where it gets the highest marks. One concern, according to BHTP: wildfires, since smoke from fires in northern Quebec can drift down to Montreal, impacting the air quality. A view of of Old Montreal, which comes in second on the list of safest cities. Reykjavik, Iceland comes in number three on the list of safest cities. According to BHTP, its high ranking is due to its excellent scores for women, people-of-color and LGBTQ+ safety, as well as safety from terrorism. Rounding out the top five is Sydney, Australia (which receives consistent safety marks from travelers) and Amsterdam in the Netherlands (which ranks highly for safety for women, LGBTQ+ travelers and people of color). The only other U.S. city on the list of world’s safest cities is Orlando, Florida, which comes in at number 15. Renowned for its theme parks and family-friendly attractions, Orlando gets high ratings for transportation safety and safety against terrorism. “While we’d caution travelers against chasing golf balls near Lake Jesup, which is home to about 10,000 alligators, Orlando has high ratings for transportation safety and safety against terrorism,” says Mueller. “This should come as no surprise—you rarely hear about disasters aboard the Walt Disney World Railroad.” The skyline of Orlando, Florida, which is on the list of the safest cities in the world in 2024. As travelers navigate the intricacies of safety, the report also offers insights into each city’s unique challenges and precautions. From concerns about wildfires in Honolulu to political demonstrations in Barcelona, travelers can make informed decisions to ensure their safety during their journeys. Beyond the overall rankings, the report also ranks cities according to the nuanced safety concerns of different traveler segments, from millennials to LGBTQ+ travelers prioritizing inclusive destinations. Read on for the lists of the world’s safest cities to travel, as well as lists from the perspective of various traveler segments. An aerial view of Honolulu and Diamond Head.   In addition to being ranked top safest city overall, Honolulu was also named the world’s safest city ... [+] for women, LGBTQ+ and BIPOC travelers.   Seoul is named the world's safest city for Millennial travelers. According to BHTP, Millennials (ages 25-44) tend to travel farther afield. “Hence, the high ratings for Singapore, Dubai and Seoul,” say the authors of the report.   Copenhagen is named the safest city for mature travelers. “Beijing’s presence here is a little surprising,” say the authors of the report. “But everything else is as expected.”   Seoul is named the top city for families. Pictured here: walking on the grouds of the Gyeongbokgung ...

LGBTQ+ Travelers “Puerto Rico’s top city doesn’t show up anywhere else but here,” say the authors of the report. “Also note that despite discriminatory laws towards LGBTQ+ travelers, they still consider Dubai to be an extremely safe destination.”    One Community.

Вартість частки Berkshire в Apple впала на 22% до 135,4 млрд дол станом на 31 березня з 174,3 млрд дол на кінець 2023 року, навіть попри те, що ціна акцій виробника iPhone впала лише на 11% за квартал. Виходячи зі змін у ціні акцій Apple, Berkshire, схоже, продав близько 115 мільйонів акцій, або 13% свого пакета, за квартал, який закінчився приблизно 790 мільйонами. На щорічних зборах Berkshire в суботу 4 травня Воррен Баффет запевнив акціонерів, що \"якщо не станеться чогось драматичного, що дійсно змінить розподіл капіталу, Apple буде нашою найбільшою інвестицією\". Він також сказав, що не проти збільшити частку готівки, зважаючи на альтернативи на фондових ринках і конфлікти в усьому світі, і сказав, що готівка може перевищити 200 мільярдів доларів до кінця червня.

Presiding over the company's annual meeting on Sunday, the nonagenarian investor said there are loads of opportunities in India. To a question on whether his company Berkshire was actively looking for opportunities in India, Buffett, without getting into specifics, said there are unexplored or unattended to opportunities and areas in India. \"Berkshire Hathaway's business and investment model is focused on acquiring and managing businesses across multiple industries \"In India, I am sure that there are loads of opportunities in a place like India, and the question is do we have any advantage, in either insights into those businesses or contacts that will make possible for some transactions that participants in India would particularly want us to participate,\" the nonagenarian investor said.\" I would say that's something that more energetic management at Berkshire could pursue because we do have a reputation now and is known around the world and our Japanese experience has been fascinating. In that respect, so there may be an unexplored or unattended to opportunities and area (in India),\" he added. Hinting at a foray in India, he said it would not take much time before it pursues opportunities in the country He added Berkshire's new management will decide on investments in India. \"We will see how the next management plays the game out at Berkshire and fortunately you don't have too long to wait on that generally,\" he said. Firm GDP growth forecasts, inflation at manageable levels, political stability at the central government level, and appreciable central bank monetary policy, have all contributed to painting a bright picture for the Indian economy in recent quarters. India's GDP grew at a massive 8.4 per cent during the October-December quarter of the current financial year 2023-24, and the country continued to remain the fastest-growing major economy and is poised to maintain its growth trajectory going ahead. India is set to remain the fastest-growing among major economies in 2024, according to latest International Monetary Fund's latest World Economic Outlook. IMF, in its latest outlook, raised India's growth projections for 2024 from 6.5 per cent to 6.8 per cent. India's economy grew 7.2 per cent in 2022-23 and 8.7 per cent in 2021-22, respectively.

Reportaj WSJ de la Adunarea Generală a Acţionarilor Berkshire: Warren Buffett laudă Apple după ce Berkshire Hathaway şi-a redus participaţia. Istoricul investitor îi aduce un omagiu şi regretatului său partener de afaceri Charlie Munger    Legendarul investitor a lăudat producătorul iPhone sâmbătă de pe scena întâlnirii sale anuale, chiar şi după ce a dezvăluit că Berkshire Hathaway şi-a redus participaţia în primul trimestru. El a   lăsat să se înţeleagă că această decizie are la bază considerente fiscale.     Buffett a declarat într-o arenă a acţionarilor Berkshire că Apple este „o afacere chiar mai bună” decât American Express şi Coca-Cola, alte două poziţii importante din masivul portofoliu de acţiuni   al companiei sale.  Vezi mai multe articole din categoria economic     Berkshire a vândut aproximativ 13% din uriaşa sa participaţie la Apple în primele luni ale anului 2024, rămânând cu 135,4 miliarde de dolari din acţiunile producătorului iPhone la sfârşitul lunii   martie, potrivit unui document de reglementare publicat sâmbătă dimineaţă.     Acţiunile Apple au scăzut cu 11% în primul trimestru, deoarece vânzările de iPhone s-au prăbuşit în China.     „Dacă nu se întâmplă ceva cu adevărat extraordinar, vom deţine Apple, American Express şi Coca-Cola când Greg va prelua acest loc”, a declarat Buffett.     Greg Abel, succesorul desemnat al lui Buffett în funcţia de director executiv al Berkshire, a stat alături de acesta pe scenă, în timp ce Tim Cook, directorul general al Apple, a privit din   mulţime.     Buffett, preşedintele şi directorul executiv al Berkshire, a declarat că este „extrem de probabil” ca Apple să rămână cea mai mare poziţie în acţiuni a companiei la sfârşitul anului.     În schimb, el a spus că Berkshire şi-a vândut poziţia la Paramount Global, care a fost subiectul unei drame în desfăşurare privind fuziunea. Acţiunile sale au scăzut cu 13% în acest an.     „Am vândut totul şi am pierdut destul de mulţi bani”, a declarat Buffett, care a respins orice speculaţie potrivit căreia unul dintre locotenenţii săi ar fi fost responsabil pentru această   investiţie. „Am făcut totul de unul singur”.     Investitori din întreaga lume s-au adunat la Omaha pentru a-l asculta pe Buffett, în vârstă de 93 de ani, vorbind despre investiţii, afaceri şi viaţă. Întâlnirea este semnificativă pentru mulţi ca   fiind prima fără regretatul partener de afaceri al lui Buffett, Charlie Munger, care a murit în noiembrie la vârsta de 99 de ani.     Buffett însuşi a căzut din nou în ritmul întâlnirilor Berkshire din trecut, când a spus din greşeală „Charlie” în loc de „Greg”, în timp ce se întorcea spre omul de lângă el. Mulţimea a izbucnit în   aplauze.     Întrebat despre cei mai de încredere consilieri ai săi în prezent, Buffett a spus că are încredere totală în copiii şi soţia sa, „dar asta nu înseamnă că îi întreb ce acţiuni să cumpere”.     „În ceea ce priveşte gestionarea banilor, nu a existat nimeni mai bun în lume cu care să vorbeşti timp de multe, multe decenii decât Charlie”, a spus Buffett.     Filmuleţul care a precedat sesiunea de întrebări şi răspunsuri a fost un omagiu adus lui Munger. Acesta a prezentat clipuri din apariţiile sale de-a lungul anilor în emisiuni TV precum „Breaking   Bad”, „Desperate Housewives” şi „The Office”, precum şi clipuri cu replicile memorabile ale lui Munger la întâlnirile anuale anterioare. S-a încheiat cu un montaj al unor duete celebre din viaţa   reală şi fictivă, care s-a încheiat cu Buffett şi Munger. Munger a fost apoi ovaţionat în picioare de către mulţime.     La evenimentele premergătoare reuniunii anuale, vizitatorii au vorbit frecvent despre Munger. Moartea sa le-a determinat pe acţionara Melissa Vainik şi pe mama sa, Rosalyn Slater, să călătorească   din nou la Omaha din West Bloomfield, Mich.     „Din cauza decesului său, am simţit nevoia să venim”, a spus Vainik. „Ce se întâmplă dacă i se întâmplă ceva lui Warren Buffett şi atunci este sfârşitul unei ere?”     Buffett a fost mult timp principalul selecţioner de acţiuni al Berkshire. Întrebat sâmbătă dacă Abel sau managerii de investiţii Todd Combs şi Ted Weschler vor prelua portofoliul de investiţii al   Berkshire în viitor, Buffett a spus că consiliul de administraţie al companiei va decide. Dar a spus că propria sa gândire în această privinţă a evoluat.     „Aş lăsa alocarea capitalului în seama lui Greg”, a spus Buffett. „El înţelege extrem de bine afacerile. Dacă înţelegi afacerile, înţelegi şi acţiunile comune. Dacă ştii cu adevărat cum   funcţionează afacerile, eşti un investitor.     Acţionarii s-au aliniat înainte de răsăritul soarelui pentru a-l asculta pe Buffett live într-o arenă de pe malul râului Missouri. Cei care au venit devreme şi au vrut să prindă un loc bun au avut   şansa să intre în parcările centrului de convenţii la ora locală 3:30, sâmbătă dimineaţa.     Hotelurile din apropiere s-au umplut devreme. În nopţile de vineri şi sâmbătă ale reuniunii anuale de anul trecut, 93% din camerele de hotel din judeţ erau ocupate, potrivit Visit Omaha.     În sala de expoziţii, acţionarii au trecut pe lângă un gecko gonflabil impunător de la Geico pentru a cumpăra jucării de pluş Squishmallows sub forma lui Buffett şi Munger de la subsidiara   Jazwares. Au stat la coadă pentru a vizita o machetă a unui avion privat NetJets în timp ce mâncau bunătăţi îngheţate de la Dairy Queen.     Evenimentele de sâmbătă au debutat cu publicarea rezultatelor Berkshire pentru primul trimestru. Veniturile operaţionale, care exclud unele rezultate din investiţii, au crescut la 11,2 miliarde de   dolari, de la 8,1 miliarde de dolari anul trecut.     Rezerva de numerar a Berkshire a crescut la un nivel record de 189 de miliarde de dolari, inclusiv echivalentele de numerar, de la 167,6 miliarde de dolari la sfârşitul anului trecut.     Cei care urmăresc compania au căutat indicii despre ce ar putea face Buffett cu tezaurul de numerar, de la achiziţionarea unei noi afaceri la cumpărarea de acţiuni şi intensificarea răscumpărărilor   de acţiuni. Berkshire nu plăteşte dividende.     Buffett a declarat sâmbătă că el şi adjuncţii săi nu ştiu cum să folosească eficient banii în numerar „şi, prin urmare, nu îi folosim”.     „Ne aruncăm doar pe terenurile care ne plac”, a adăugat el.              Pentru cele mai importante ştiri ale zilei, transmise în timp real şi prezentate echidistant, daţi LIKE paginii noastre de Facebook!

    "description": null,
    "published_at": "2024-05-05T05:50:44Z",
    "content": "US-Investmentlegende Warren Buffett findet offenbar aktuell keine attraktiven Anlageobjekte und lässt die Reserven seiner Holding Berkshire Hathaway auf Rekordwerte wachsen. Zum Ende des vergangenen Quartals hatte Berkshire Hathaway rund 189 Milliarden Dollar (etwa 175,5 Mrd. Euro) an Bargeld und in kurzfristig angelegten Staatsanleihen zur Verfügung. Bei dem jährlichen Aktionärstreffen in Omaha gestern sagte Buffett, es sei davon auszugehen, dass die Reserven nach dem laufenden Vierteljahr die Marke von 200 Milliarden Dollar übersteigen würden. Buffett betonte, Berkshire würde das Geld gern angelegen, „aber wir werden es nur für etwas ausgeben, was geringes Risiko hat und uns eine Menge Geld bringen kann“. Berkshire Hathaway gehören unter anderem der Versicherer Geico, die Eisenbahngesellschaft BNSF und der Batteriehersteller Duracell. Die Holding ist auch in der Versicherungsbranche aktiv. Der 93-jährige Buffett legte bei dem Treffen in einer prall gefüllten Sport- und Entertainmentarena auch seine Präferenzen für eine Nachfolgelösung offen. Wenn es nach ihm ginge, würde er das letzte Wort bei Investmententscheidungen seinem designierten Nachfolger, Greg Abel, überlassen, sagte Buffett. Letztlich werde aber der Verwaltungsrat von Berkshire über die Nachfolgeregelung entscheiden. Buffett hatte Abel, der aktuell das Energiegeschäft von Berkshire führt, bereits 2021 als seinen Nachfolger auf dem Chefposten vorgestellt. Aktuell denkt er allerdings noch nicht daran, sich zurückzuziehen. red, ORF.at/Agenturen"

    "title": "Starinvestor Warren Buffett - „Es ist besser, Dummheiten zu vermeiden, als genial sein zu wollen“",
    "description": "Obwohl sich Warren Buffett bei der diesjährigen Hauptversammlung seines Unternehmens Berkshire Hathaway erstmals seit fast fünf Jahrzehnten ohne seinen Ende 2023 verstorbenen Co-Vorsitzenden Charlie Munger auf der Bühne in Omaha den Fragen der Anleger stellte…",
    "published_at": "2024-05-05T05:35:02Z",
    "content": "Warren Buffett zeigte sich bei der diesjährigen Hauptversammlung seines Unternehmens Berkshire Hathaway gewohnt Angriffslustig. Auch das Thema Steuern spielte eine Rolle. Die wichtigste: Obwohl Berkshire Hathaway rund ein Zehntel seiner Apple-Aktien verkauft hat, glaubt Buffett weiter an die Zukunft des iPhone-Herstellers. „Apple bleibt unsere größte Investition, eines unserer profitabelsten Unternehmen und ein Unternehmen, das wir im Idealfall ewig halten wollen.“ Konkrete Gründe für den Verkauf nannte Buffett nicht. Er deutete aber steuerliche Überlegungen an, vor allem in Erwartung höherer Steuern auf Kapitalerträge: „Wenn Politiker irgendwann merken, dass sie nicht beliebig Schulden machen können, aber auch keine Leistungen kürzen wollen, bleibt ihnen nur, höhere Steuern zu erheben. Auch auf Kapitalerträge.“ Diese Erwartungen eingerechnet, lohnt es sich für Berkshire, einen Teil seiner immens im Preis gestiegenen Apple -Position zu verkaufen, bevor der Staat darauf höhere Abgaben verlangt. Buffett erinnerte an Zeiten, in denen US-Anleger über 50 Prozent ihrer Gewinne an das Finanzamt abführten. Buffett betonte allerdings, höhere Steuern gerne zu zahlen: „In einem Land, das so viel für seine Menschen getan hat, zahlen wir unsere vollen Steuern. Und keiner unserer Aktionäre sollte ein Problem damit haben. Würde das jedes Unternehmen so sehen, müsste keine Privatperson in den USA Steuern zahlen.“ Für deutsche Anleger interessant ist Buffetts Aussage, weil eine steigende Kapitalertragssteuer in den USA auch anderen Ländern als Signal dienen könnte, Kapitalerträge stärker zu besteuern. Auch die Bundesrepublik braucht Einnahmen. Buffetts wichtigste Aussagen zu den Themen der Hauptversammlung im Überblick: „Wir haben alles verkauft. Wir haben viel Geld dabei verloren. Und das habe ich ganz allein geschafft. Ich habe falsch eingeschätzt, wie Menschen ihre Freizeit verbringen und Filme und Serien konsumieren.“ (Zur Erklärung, warum Berkshire bei Paramount ausstieg, nachdem es im Dezember 2023 noch über 66 Millionen Aktien des Unterhaltungs-Riesen besessen hatte.) „Wir prüfen derzeit eine Anlageoption in Kanada.“ (Auf die Frage, ob er in Kanada investieren würde. Gerüchten zufolge kauft Berkshire derzeit Aktien eines Finanzunternehmens.) „Wir finden derzeit kaum gute Gelegenheiten. Also wächst unser Cash. Uns freut, dass wir darauf jetzt wieder 5,4 Prozent Zinsen bekommen. Aber es wäre bei einem Prozent nicht anders. Sagen Sie das nur nicht der Zentralbank!“ (Zum Rekordstand flüssiger Mittel von knapp 190 Milliarden US-Dollar.) „Die wichtigsten Lektionen beim Investieren lauten: Kaufe eine Aktie so sorgfältig, als würdest du das ganze Unternehmen kaufen, und sehe den Markt als deinen Diener, nicht als Informationsquelle oder Herrscher.“ „Die USA bleiben auf absehbare Zeit unser Schwerpunkt.“ (Auf die Frage, ob er gezielt Investitionen in China sucht.) „Ich sehe keine Alternative zum Dollar als Weltreservewährung.“ (Zu Sorgen, asiatische oder digitale Währungen könnten den US-Dollar als Weltreservewährung ablösen.) „Wir betreiben Kraftwerke und Energieunternehmen effizienter als der Staat. Davon profitieren alle Menschen.“ (Auf die Frage, ob Länder Energieunternehmen verstaatlichen sollten.) „Charlie war der geniale Architekt hinter Berkshire Hathaway. Ich war so etwas wie der Generalunternehmer. Oder der Dachdecker.“ „Charlie hat sich für alles interessiert und bis zuletzt alles erforscht. Deswegen hat sich nicht nur er für die Welt interessiert, sondern auch die Welt für ihn, einen 99-Jährigen.“ „Charlie hat mich nicht nur nie belogen, er hat die Wahrheit auch nie zu seinen Gunsten gebogen. Wenn man solche Menschen findet, hält man sie in seinem Leben. Den Rest kann man vergessen.“ „Wer kein Leben lebt, in dem er sich mit Leuten umgibt, denen er vertraut, und zwar nur mit ihnen, verpasst etwas.“ „Charlie hat alle Techniken gelernt, mit denen Menschen andere Menschen überlisten und ausnutzen, aber nur, um sich und andere davor zu schützen. Wer so denkt, ist ein besonderer Mensch.“ „KI wird unseren Wohlstand vergrößern, aber wir sollten bei genauen Vorhersagen vorsichtig bleiben. [Der bekannte Ökonom] John Maynard Keynes hat vor rund 100 Jahren das riesige Produktivitätswachstum des 20. Jahrhunderts recht genau vorhergesagt. Aber selbst Keynes lag falsch darin, wo und wie das passiert. Und wenn selbst Keynes falsch liegt, sollten wir daraus etwas lernen.“ (Zur Frage, welche Berufe und Unternehmen von KI profitieren und welche darunter leiden.) „Das macht Betrügereien zur Wachstumsindustrie. Neulich hätte ich mir beinahe selbst Geld in entferntes Land geschickt.“ (Zu Betrügern, die den Enkel-Trick mit täuschend echten KI-Kopien von Stimme und Aussehen echter Menschen durchführen. Buffett berichtete, unlängst eine solche KI-Kopie von sich selbst gesehen zu haben.) „KI ist wie die Kernspaltung. Lassen wir den Geist einmal aus der Flasche, bekommen wir ihn nicht mehr zurück. Dann kann er Großartiges leisten, aber uns auch wünschen lassen, ihn doch zurückzubekommen.“ „Sie können ein Kind nicht in einem Monat bekommen, indem Sie neun Frauen schwängern. Manche Dinge brauchen ihre Zeit.“ (Auf die Frage, warum Berkshire-Hathway trotz Klimawandel auch Gaskraftwerke baut. Diese ersetzen Kohlekraftwerke, um Erzeugungslücken bei den erneuerbaren Energien auszugleichen, erklärte das Berkshire-Management. Langfristig blieben erneuerbare Energien mit Batterien zum Schwankungsausgleich das Ziel ihrer Stromstrategie). „Solarenergie wird nie die einzige Energieform sein.“ „Wenn Sie nicht reich sind, seien Sie nett. Dann tragen Sie mehr zur Welt bei als die meisten reichen Menschen. Und wenn Sie zu den finanziell Glücklichen gehören: Machen Sie auch andere glücklich.“ „Überlege dir, wen du heiraten willst und warum diese Person dein Leben verbessert. Dann arbeite daran, jemand zu werden, mit dem diese Person wirklich zusammen sein will.“ „Überlege, wie du auf dein Leben zurückblicken willst. Dann lebe so, dass du das eines Tages tun kannst.“ „Es ist besser, Dummheiten zu vermeiden, als genial sein zu wollen. Das Ergebnis ist dasselbe, aber wenn man es so macht wie wir, erreicht man es leichter.“ “Charlie hatte viele Helden. Aber als ich ihn fragte, wen er vor seinem Tod am liebsten getroffen hätte, sagte er: ‚Ich habe sie schon getroffen. Ich habe ihre Bücher gelesen. Das empfehle ich Ihnen allen: Treffen Sie Ihre Helden. Treffen Sie sie oft. Und warten Sie nicht bis zum letzten Tag.” „Die Schaut-mich-an-Leute gehen lieber woanders hin.“ “Feiern sind ein wichtiges Werkzeug, damit eine Gruppe von Menschen gut zusammenarbeitet.“ “Ich mag das Gefühl von Vertrauen. Charlie ging es genauso. Deshalb machen wir das hier. Und deshalb machen wir es so, wie wir es machen.“ „Glücklicherweise erfahren Sie bald, wie sich das neue Management um Berkshire kümmert. Mir geht es gut, aber ich kenne die Sterbetafeln. Ich sollte keine Vierjahresverträge mehr unterschreiben. Obwohl das viele Leute tun, bei denen man nicht sicher sein kann, wo sie in vier Jahren sein werden.“ (Zur Frage, ob sein designierter Nachfolger Greg Abel das Unternehmen genauso gut führen werde wie er.) „Ich hoffe, sie kommen nächstes Jahr wieder zur Hauptversammlung. Vor allem hoffe ich, ich komme auch.“ \nBörse\nAlle Informationen zusammengefasst\n \nAktien\nDie Top-Aktien im Überblick\n \nRohstoffe\nDie wichtigsten Rohstoffe im Überblick\n \nAnleihen\nDie Top Anleihen für Ihre Bedürfnisse\n \nWährungen\nAlle Währungskurse im Überblick\n"

    "description": "The benchmark diesel price used for most fuel surcharges was down Monday for the fourth week in a row. The post Diesel benchmark down again as signs point to...",
    "published_at": "2024-05-06T22:19:11Z",
    "content": "Another decline in the benchmark retail price of diesel used for most fuel surcharges is the most outward sign of a market that is sagging in several places. The Department of Energy/Energy Information Administration average weekly retail price declined 5.3 cents a gallon Monday, falling to $3.894. It was the fourth consecutive decline and the biggest one-week drop since Dec. 18, and it puts the price at its lowest level since Jan. 29. Retail prices are generally the last place to see the impact of other price moves up the supply chain, and this week’s price is no different. Oil overall and diesel in particular have been on a downward trend for several weeks coming off a recent peak near the start of April when the international crude benchmark crossed the $90-a-barrel mark and talk of $100 a barrel began once again. But prices have fizzled since, as Middle East violence continues to have no impact on supplies of oil from the region. On Monday, that crude benchmark, Brent, closed at $83.33, a slight upturn from the $82.96-a-barrel price from Friday but a long way from a level that would raise fears about $100 prices.  Ultra low sulfur diesel on the CME exchange has followed suit. From a settlement April 5 of $2.773 a gallon, ULSD settled Monday at $2.4611, a slight increase from the recent low Thursday when ULSD settled at $2.4431 a gallon but still well off the early April high. Diesel markets have been elevated relative to crude for months now in part because inventories of diesel and other distillate products stubbornly would not build. Various indicators of the level of inventories, whether in the U.S. or globally, all pointed to tight stocks. But in the U.S. at least, that trend may be breaking. According to the weekly report from the EIA, U.S. inventories of ULSD have been stuck between 106 million and a little more than 108 million barrels since the start of March.  But the price of ULSD on the CME commodity contract has moved into contango in recent days after being in the opposite condition — backwardation — for months. In contango, the lowest price on the calendar is the spot month, which Monday would have been barrels for June delivery. July barrels are priced higher, and August is higher than July. Backwardation is the opposite structure, with the first traded month at the highest price. A contango market encourages the building of inventories. The fact that inventories have not built while the market has been in backwardation is not surprising. But if supplies begin to build up despite the backwardation, eventually the pressure of that supply will push the market into contango. And that’s what has happened. At the beginning of March, the backwardation between the first- and second-month ULSD contract on CME was about 10 cents a gallon, with the second month that much higher than the first. But in recent days, the market has moved into a contango of around 1.3 to 1.4 cents a gallon, a shift that will encourage inventory-building. The weekly email newsletter of The Tank Tiger, a firm that serves as a broker between storage facilities with space to lease and commercial interests looking to store hydrocarbons, commented on the change. “If you’re not burning distillate, then you have no choice but to store it,” company founder Ernie Barsamian wrote in his most recent newsletter. “Commensurate with that, [CME] ULSD futures are showing a seasonal contango, despite the fact that crude oil remains backwardated. Of course, The Tank Tiger was on the leading edge of all of this, as we saw a big spike in inquiries for distillate storage over the last couple of weeks.” Physical market spreads also are not increasing. Those spreads are the ones in key physical markets such as the Gulf Coast and are measured as a differential between physical barrels of ULSD on a barge or pipeline compared to the CME price. They are largely unchanged over the past few weeks and are not at levels that would suggest market tightness. Another sign of diesel markets loosening came in the earnings information from travel center operator Pilot in the quarterly earnings report of its parent corporation, Berkshire Hathaway. A significant drop in its earnings before income taxes between the first quarter of 2023 and 2024 suggests a sharp decline in the spread between retail and wholesale prices, a key profit driver for any retail outlet. Given the predominance of diesel sales at Pilot, the presumed weakness in fuel spreads mostly came from the diesel market.  (1/2) Quarterly earnings from $BRK.A suggest it may have bought Pilot near the top. EBIT for Q1 '24 was $70 million. For the two months of Q1 '23 it owned Pilot, EBIT was $136 million. 3-month revenue in '24 was $12.5 million; for the 2 months of '23 ownership it was $9.5 mil… pic.twitter.com/oEGSFpUyyy — John Kingston (@JohnHKingston) May 6, 2024 The one noteworthy piece of bullish news Monday was that Saudi Arabia’s monthly price formula for barrels sold in June had been increased significantly. The Saudis price their barrels as a differential to key benchmarks, which differ depending on the market that they are selling into. The benchmark price differential for Arab Light was increased to $2.90 a barrel, up 90 cents. That large move is a sign of Saudi Arabia continuing to keep a tight hold on its supplies into the market. But the impact on crude prices was minimal with both West Texas Intermediate and Brent rising just 37 cents a barrel by the end of the day.

    "description": "Primeira conferência após a morte de Charlie Munger rende homenagem à dupla dos negócios",
    "published_at": "2024-05-06T21:03:49Z",
    "content": " A Berkshire Hathaway, conglomerado de investimentos do bilionário Warren Buffett, realizou sua conferência anual de acionistas no último sábado, 4, com o próprio Buffett comentando temas que vão da economia americana à inteligência artificial. Aos 93 anos de idade, o investidor célebre disse não entender de inteligência artificial (IA), mas a comparou à energia nuclear, frisando seu enorme potencial tanto para o bem quanto para o mal. Ao auditório lotado, em Omaha, Nebraska, nos Estados Unidos, ele mostrou um vídeo gerado por IA em que aparecia falando coisas que nunca disse. Segundo Buffett, nem suas filhas conseguiram identificar que se tratava de algo falso, ilustrando sua preocupação referente à essa tecnologia. Em relação à conjuntura econômica dos Estados Unidos, Buffett lembrou que a situação fiscal do país, cada vez mais endividado, pode demandar ajustes, como um aumento de impostos. Para ele, esse cenário estimula a venda de ações, com vista a pagar menos impostos agora do que no futuro. A Berkshire, inclusive, se desfez de parte de seus papéis da Apple, argumentando que a exposição à gigante de tecnologia estava demasiadamente elevada. Na presença de Tim Cook, CEO da Apple, que estava no evento, foi dito que o papel segue atraente no entanto. Buffett se emocionou durante o evento, o primeiro do tipo após o falecimento de Charlie Munger, seu braço direito nos negócios. Na ocasião, a dupla foi comparada a Batman e Robin, e ao Gordo e o Magro, parceiros de décadas. A empresa que os dois ajudaram a construir hoje conta com cerca de 182 bilhões de dólares em caixa. “O caixa é tão grande que eles têm dificuldade para utilizá-lo consideravelmente. Seriam necessários grandes investimentos, o que tem sido difícil de localizar. Mas Buffett não acha que o S&P, indicador do mercado financeiro dos EUA, em geral, está caro”, diz William Castro Alves, estrategista-chefe da corretora Avenue, que estava no evento em Omaha. “O evento estava muito cheio. Nunca vi tao lotado, com filas pra tudo, gente da Malásia, Índia, Brasil etc. Acho que é o efeito Munger”. \nAssine\n \nAssine\n \nAssine\n \nAssine\n \nAssine\n \nAssine\n Leia também no  Abril Comunicações S.A., CNPJ 44.597.052/0001-62 - Todos os direitos reservados.

The 30-share BSE Sensex edged up 17.39 points or 0.02 per cent to settle at 73,895.54. The barometer hit a high of 74,359.69 and a low of 73,786.29. The broader NSE Nifty declined 33.15 points or 0.15 per cent to close at 22,442.70. From the Sensex basket, Kotak Mahindra Bank jumped 5 per cent after the company reported a 25 per cent growth in its March quarter net profit at Rs 5,302 crore, limited by a drop in the core income due to narrow interest margins. Tata Consultancy Services, Hindustan Unilever, Mahindra & Mahindra, Sun Pharma, Tech Mahindra and IndusInd Bank were among the other major gainers. Titan tanked 7 per cent after its March quarter earnings failed to cheer investors. State Bank of India, NTPC, Power Grid, Bajaj Finance and Larsen & Toubro were the other laggards. The domestic indices traded in a range-bound manner, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. “The broader indices also witnessed major selling pressure due to valuation concerns and profit-booking,” he added. “Today, the benchmark indices witnessed lacklustre activity – the Nifty ends 33 points lower while the Sensex was up by 17 points,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities. In the broader market, the BSE smallcap gauge declined 1.06 per cent, midcap index dipped 0.95 per cent. Consumer durables tanked 3.85 per cent, services declined 1.95 per cent, utilities (1.76 per cent), power (1.26 per cent), industrials (0.80 per cent) and commodities (0.78 per cent). Healthcare, IT, auto, realty and teck were the gainers. Aditya Gaggar Director of Progressive Shares said that a steep correction in PSU stocks put pressure on the index to trade lower. A vertical fall in the Mid and Smallcaps dented the market sentiments further however, select FMCG, IT, and Pharma counters supported the market, he added. Global oil benchmark Brent crude climbed 0.80 per cent to USD 83.62 a barrel. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) offloaded equities worth Rs 2,391.98 crore on Friday, according to exchange data. In Asian markets, Shanghai and Hong Kong settled in the positive territory. Japan and South Korea’s markets were closed for the holidays. European markets were trading with gains. Wall Street ended with significant gains on Friday. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said that the Indian market has “unexplored” opportunities which his conglomerate holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, would like to explore “in the future”. Buffett’s remarks came at Berkshire’s annual meeting on Friday when Rajeev Agarwal of DoorDarshi Advisors, a US-based hedge fund that invests in Indian equities, asked him about the possibility of Berkshire exploring in India, the world’s fifth-largest economy. The BSE benchmark dropped 732.96 points or 0.98 per cent to settle at 73,878.15 on Friday. The NSE Nifty also declined 172.35 points or 0.76 per cent to 22,475.85. (PTI)          "

(NYSE: MWA) (“Mueller” or the “Company”) today announced that Marietta (“Martie”) Edmunds Zakas has been appointed Chief Executive Officer. Ms. Zakas has served as the Company’s CEO and President since August 2023 and previously served as Chief Financial Officer. Ms. Zakas’ appointment followed a comprehensive and competitive internal and external search process conducted by the Board with the support of a leading executive search firm. In addition, Paul McAndrew, Chief Operating Officer, has been promoted to President. These changes are effective immediately. “The Board performed a thorough process to identify our next CEO, and it is clear that Martie is the right leader for Mueller,” said Stephen C. Van Arsdell, Board Chair. “Many already know Martie well, and few know Mueller better than she does. Under her leadership, despite a challenging external environment, Mueller has delivered strong results with a focus on long-term sustainable growth. In addition, we have continued to enhance Mueller through key external hires, internal promotions and organizational realignment.   We are confident in Martie’s ability to unlock Mueller's full potential as we enter this exciting next chapter for Mueller and the water infrastructure industry.” Ms. Zakas said, “It is an honor to continue in the role of CEO. Mueller plays a critical role in helping our customers deliver clean, safe drinking water to millions of people. I am excited about the opportunities our talented and committed employees have to build on our strong foundation of industry-leading brands and deep channel and end customer relationships. As we address the challenges of aging water infrastructure across our markets with our products and solutions, I am confident that the Company is well-positioned to continue to deliver profitable growth in the months and years ahead. I look forward to working with Paul, the Board, and the rest of the team as we continue to execute our strategy and enhance shareholder value.” Mr. Van Arsdell continued, “Since joining Mueller in November 2022, Paul has played a vital role in overseeing the Company’s global manufacturing operations, supply chain and commercial activities. He brings more than twenty years of leadership experience, demonstrated cross-cultural expertise, and a proven ability to foster growth and create transformative change. In a very short period of time, Paul’s initiatives and ideas have revitalized our organization. Our recent financial success is a testament to our team’s intense focus on all aspects of our business, which will continue as Martie, Paul and our entire team advance our transformation. We will continue to seek to exceed our customers’ expectations by delivering products of the highest quality as we extend our markets through both organic and inorganic growth.” Mr. McAndrew said, “I am thrilled to continue to partner with Martie and our team to enhance customer experience and drive operational excellence in all that we undertake. Since I joined Mueller, we have been strategic in our approach to every facet of the business, which the investment community is seeing in our performance, our distributors and customers are seeing in our delivery times and product quality and our employees are seeing in their daily activities. Mueller has leading brands, tremendous products and exceptional people who will continue to drive the Company forward. The best part is that this is only the beginning.” Christian Garcia Joins the Board as Part of Continuing Refreshment Plan, Brian Healy Elected to the Board The Company also announced that Christian Garcia joined the Mueller Board of Directors as a Board observer and will serve in this capacity until later this year, when he is expected to be appointed as a Board Director. Once Mr. Garcia is appointed, the Board will be comprised of 11 members, 10 of whom will be independent. Additionally, as previously disclosed, Brian Healy, initially appointed to the Board as an observer, was elected in February 2024. Mr. Van Arsdell concluded, “As we execute the next phase of our strategy to accelerate value creation, generate growth and expand margins, Christian’s strong operational and financial expertise in the industrial and manufacturing sectors across global organizations will help enhance Mueller.” In the past five years, Mueller has elected seven new Board members who bring fresh perspectives and a wealth of experience, reflecting our commitment to bring new and diverse viewpoints to the boardroom while benefiting from the guidance and experiences of our more tenured directors. The Board remains committed to its refreshment plan as announced in October 2022. As part of this plan, the Company recently updated its Corporate Governance Policy to provide that, generally, members of the Board who are 75 years of age or older, or those who have served on the Board for 10 successive years, will not be nominated for a new term. The term and age limits are intended to help ensure new ideas and viewpoints are available while retaining valuable Board experience developed over a period of time.

O dia contou com as falas de alguns dirigentes que não ofereceram sinais contrários a esta perspectiva. Entre as empresas, alguns balanços repercutiram no mercado, enquanto o setor de chips foi o destaque entre as altas. O Dow Jones fechou em alta de 0,46%, em 38.852,27 pontos, o S&P 500 subiu 1,03%, a 5.180,74 pontos, e o Nasdaq avançou 1,19%, a 16.349,25 pontos. O Fed deverá cortar juros eventualmente, mas está bem posicionado no momento para aguardar por mais dados, afirmou um dos seus dirigentes com direito a voto nas decisões de juros, John Williams. Já o dirigente do Fed de Richmond, Tom Barkin, afirmou hoje que o mercado de trabalho está “forte”, o que segundo ele dá ao Fed tempo para “ganhar confiança” de que a inflação de fato se move de modo sustentável para a meta de 2%. Em discurso, o dirigente disse ter “preocupações” sobre a demanda e a inflação, mas se diz “otimista” de que o nível atual dos juros possa conter a demanda e levar a inflação de volta ao objetivo do BC. Continua depois da publicidade Entre as empresas um dos destaques são as ações da Berkshire Hathaway, com alta de 1,01%, após apresentar resultados trimestrais melhores que o esperado, no fim de semana, quando o megainvestidor Warren Buffett falou a investidores na reunião anual da holding em Omaha, Nebraska. Por outro lado, a Spirit Airlines caiu 9,70% após divulgar resultados. Já a Boeing recuou 0,80%, após a Administração Federal de Aviação (FAA, na sigla em inglês) dos Estados Unidos abrir nova investigação sobre a empresa, relacionada com as inspeções do 787 Dreamliner da companhia e também para saber se empregados dela falsificaram registros. Entre as altas no setor de chips, Nvidia (+3,77%), AMD (+3,44%) e Micron (+4,73%) se destacaram. A Nvidia é o fornecedor dominante de chips para treinar sistemas de IA, com a AMD sendo o segundo maior player. Não é provável que isso mude tão cedo, mas a AMD poderá se beneficiar da mudança do treinamento para a inferência – o processo de geração de respostas ou resultados a partir de modelos de IA, de acordo com Ben Reitzes, analista da Melius Research. “Embora vencedores como Nvidia e Broadcom sejam óbvios, o aumento do investimento na grande nuvem deve beneficiar a AMD, assim como a Microsoft e a Meta, que, em particular, fazem pedidos para inferir cargas de trabalho”, escreveu Reitzes. *Com informações Dow Jones Newswires. \n                                        Embora exista uma convicção de que a inflação caminha no sentido certo, o crescimento ainda robusto do emprego gera dúvidas sobre começo seguro da flexbilização                                     \n                                        Leitura preliminar da Universidade de Michigan sobre o índice geral de confiança do consumidor ficou em 67,4 este mês, em comparação com uma leitura final de 77,2 em abril                                     \n\n                    Estadão Conteúdo                \n \n"

    "content": "中央銀行週一（5/6）公布我國4月底外匯存底為5,670.19億美元，較3月底少10.81億，主因是美元指數上漲1.66%，主要貨幣兌美元貶值，央行進場調節阻貶新台幣所致。 週一（5/6）台幣兌美元收在32.347元，升值2.9分，收盤創近3周新高，連續反彈6個交易日，從32.6元反轉向上顯著升值，外資交易員分析，後續能否挑戰32元整數仍待美國經濟數據出爐而定，未來一旦美國啟動降息，也將帶領非美貨幣走升，台幣升值也可期。 央行外匯局長蔡烱民指出，4月美元指數升值1.66%，各主要貨幣中，只有澳幣升1.03％及人民幣升0.08％相對美元走升，但是幅度不高，其他包括新台幣貶1.66％、歐元貶0.65％、英鎊貶0.6％、加幣1.03％，韓元貶2.59％，其中又以日圓貶值3.47%幅度較大。主要是因為外匯存底以美元計價，美元升值，外匯存底轉換成美元就會減少。   4月國際匯市波動較大，各國央行出手干預，由於台灣電子業，尤其半導體產業景氣佳，經濟基本面好，因此新台幣兌美元貶幅低於日本、韓國。     ▲ 主要貨幣對美元升貶幅度。圖／中央銀行   今年以來，我外匯存底已經連4個月下滑，4月外資賣超台股逾1300億元台幣，含盈餘匯出達70多億美元，也影響台幣匯價。     而中國、日本、越南央行都出手守住匯率防線，被問到台灣央行是否加入此行列？蔡炯民說，「我們實際上也有做。」只是與其他國家央行做法不同，台灣電子業、尤其半導體產業景氣蠻好，廠商要發薪水、繳稅、投資，必須把手上的出口所得（美元）換成台幣，因此台灣在外匯市場上的供需比他們穩。   蔡烱民說，台灣第一季GDP成長蠻強，雖然4月有幾天股匯市震盪較大，台灣央行也在某幾天出手調節，但在那之後，出口商持續進場拋匯，這是台灣與其他國家不同之處。   至於有一些言論擔憂4月日圓一度貶破160兑1美元，亞洲各國是否因出口而競貶，掀起貨幣大戰。蔡烱民則認為，近年來真正影響各國貨幣升貶的原因主要還是「資本移動」，貶值帶動出口競爭的影響不大。例如台灣就是股市表現影響資本移動、日本是利差因素，中國則是景氣、管制措施會影響資本移動。     各界關注美國聯準會動向，今年是否會降息？蔡烱民認為，美國經濟出現走緩跡象，這是聯準會縮減量化緊縮規模，今年仍有降息可能的原因，目前市場認為，聯準會今年底前降息兩碼的機率約6成可能。   蔡烱民接著指出，今年聯準會貨幣政策動向對股市的影響已經減弱，不會像2022年影響那麼大，影響力較大的反而會是市場景氣前景的看法。 更多今周刊文章《富爸爸》作者：致富最佳時機來了！市場崩盤已開始，牢記生存6法則「不要接刀、遠離受害者」0056花13天填息比前次還快，百萬股民笑了！38元還能買？她給3理由「第一金改存高息ETF」 看更多相關新聞當沖降稅擬延長 藍委批鼓勵投機財部：不會鉅額超徵 惟證交稅沒把握彭博：巴菲特囤現金 看空股市4月外資出走 金管會：隨景氣復甦台股動能仍穩健美國曝險占比寫新高 金控海外盈虧關鍵點 ◤抗通膨首選 小資煉金術◢黃金抗漲6折起 一台兩現省萬元金緻品全館結帳88折 領券再折扣點睛品計價黃金 保值選這款純金項鍊999元起 小資族可輕鬆入手日韓劇女主角最愛 鉑金首飾7折起 日本豐田汽車公布最新財報，受惠於日圓貶值，還有油電車大賣，第四季淨利暴增近80%，大幅優於市場預期，全年獲利衝破5兆日圓，成為第一個達到「5兆里程碑」的日本企業。不過因為研發成本增加，2025年的財測偏向保守。 [Newtalk新聞] 中國前首富、萬達集團創辦人王健林已脫手 15 座萬達廣場變現。上個月，萬達旗下又有一家公司轉讓，顯示王健林已出售位於北京的萬達總部。近日，社群媒體上傳出王健林「骨瘦如柴」的近照，以及兒子王思聰出境日本的照片，外界紛紛猜測王健林是否已經結清債務。 綜合媒體 4 月報導，萬達集團持續甩賣資產，甚至連集團總部所在大樓都不放過。4 月 9 日，北京萬達廣場實業有限公司發生股權變更，原全資股東大連萬達商業管理集團股份有限公司退出，新增股東坤華（天津）股權投資合夥企業，持股99.99%，為控股股東；坤元辰興（廈門）投資管理諮詢有限公司持股0.01%。 接手的坤華合夥人為新華人壽保險股份有限公司和中金資本運營有限公司，出資額人民幣 100 億元（約新台幣446億元），其中新華保險持股 99.9%，中金資本持股 0.1%。 Ｘ（前推特）網友@MonsterguySusu評論道：「王健林骨瘦如柴，全憑一口氣在硬撐，萬達始終在暴雷的邊緣，即便是他把萬達控制權轉讓，把核心資產賤賣，也沒有完全解除萬達的債務風險。但是，他兒子的風險解除了。五一節前把長安街的萬達廣場賣給中金資本後，王思聰 金融股今天發動攻勢，在國泰金大漲7.3％領軍下，金融股全面上攻，盤面紅通通一片，終場，金融類股指數上漲2.7％，以最高點1948做收，也創下歷史新高。 [FTNN新聞網]記者蕭宥彤／台北報導台股今（10）日開高走高，權值股台積電回神領軍，加上航運、金融族群大漲，指數終場上漲148.07點，收在20,708.84點，漲幅0.... 台股8日黑翻紅，尾盤更靠台積電（2330）、聯發科（2454）奮力一拉，站上20,700關卡，向上挑戰歷史新高意圖濃烈，5月以來行情高檔震盪向上，市場看空也悄悄集結，統計至5月7日借券賣出餘額達到1,237萬張，創下歷史新高水位。法人表示，借券賣出餘額增加多、股價卻逆勢上漲的個股，有中信金（2891）、興富發（2542）、大同（2371）等16檔，遭軋空並有機會認錯回補及進一步推升行情。 [NOWnews今日新聞]台北股市今（9）日早盤走勢相對震盪，不過午盤過後在權值股走低之下，終場收在最低點，下跌139.74點或0.68%，收在20560.77點，日K終結連3紅，成交量為4180.1... 台積電（2330）今（10）日舉行臨時董事會，會中通過配發2024年第一季現金股利每股4元，較上季的3.5元再調高，配息基準日訂為2024年9月18日，除息交易日則為2024年9月12日。 外資又落跑，今（9）日從台股提款207.82億元，衝擊台股，終場跌139點，觀察外資砍最多的標的，第一名是上市第一天的群益科技高息成長ETF（00946），00946、00944成分股也入榜。 [NOWnews今日新聞]台北股市今（9）日收在最低點，下跌139.74點或0.68%，收在20560.77點，日K終結連3紅，成交量為4180.13億元；三大法人合計賣超175.99億元。觀察三大法... 水泥雙雄 4 月營收月減 1 成 台泥併購效益挹注創同期高。 [FTNN新聞網]記者馮茵／台北報導在AI手機、AI伺服器、AIPC助燃下，電子權值股台積電（2330）、聯發科（2454）8日股價直衝，帶動大盤站回20,700.51點，法人分...

    "content": "Fund next-gen business journalism with $10 a month Search Free Newsletters The stock market started off well on Monday, following a few weeks of bloodbaths and some amazing earnings reports. Investors are pouring money into the stock market, hoping that the Fed will soon slash interest rates.  Meanwhile, there are some reports that Hamas has accepted a cease-fire proposal from Egypt and Qatar to end the war with Israel, which boosted the confidence of investors. Israel has not yet released an official statement on the matter, and there is a possibility that it will refuse the proposal, as per a Reuters report. There has been no decline in oil prices, with West Texas Intermediate at $78.71 a barrel, up 0.77%, and Brent at $83.51 a barrel, up 0.66%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped roughly 0.4%, or 176 points, to 38,852 as the market closed. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 1%. Spirit Airlines reported its 10th consecutive quarterly loss of $160 million and expects another loss next quarter. The airline still has $1.5 billion in debt that it has to pay off in the next couple of years. Its debt due 2025 is trading at 73 cents on the dollar, and its 2026 debt is at 55 cents. Following the news, the stock declined 9.7% by the end of the day.  On the other hand, Spirit Airlines’ rivals soar on Monday. American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines were among the top-performing stocks, up 5.7%, 4.8%, and 4.4%, respectively. Shares of Paramount Global went up 3% by the end of the day amid ongoing discussions about who will acquire the streaming and entertainment company. Paramount Global is reportedly in formal talks with Sony Pictures Entertainment and Apollo Global Management for a takeover bid, according to the New York Times. Last week, Reuters reported that Paramount wouldn’t extend its exclusive merger discussions with Skydance, the film production company led by David Ellison when it expired Friday.  Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett revealed last weekend that the company dumped all of its remaining shares of Paramount — that too at a loss. Micron Technology’s stock gained over 4.5% after Baird upgraded it to outperform from neutral, saying there is plenty of room for growth for shares. So far, in 2024, Micron Technology Inc. shares are up 40%.  Last month, the semiconductor manufacturing company was reported to receive $6.1 billion in CHIPS and Science Act funds to build chip fabrication plants (fabs) in central New York and Idaho. The Biden administration said the investments across New York and Idaho would create 70,000 jobs. Similarly, Super Micro Computer, which saw a dip last week after releasing its earnings report, was in demand on Monday, gaining over 4.5% in the late afternoon trading. Nvidia was up 3.3% shortly before the market closed. Warren Buffett admittedly isn’t an expert on artificial intelligence — but what he does know makes him nervous. Speaking at a question-and-answer session at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders conference Saturday, Buffett likened the advent of AI to his views on nuclear weapons. In its latest earnings report, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire reported $21 billion in cash and Treasuries, bringing it to a record $189 billion last quarter — a 13% increase in just three months. In the same quarter, Berkshire offloaded a net $17 billion worth of stocks and bought back $2.6 billion worth of its own stock, up from $2.2 billion in the prior quarter. The stock was flat most of the day, closing the day with a 1% gain. Bitcoin rebounded to $64,000 on Monday after experiencing a significant decline last week. The latest surge in Bitcoin price comes amid the resurgence of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF has finally seen inflows. According to data compiled by Farside, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is the biggest Bitcoin ETF in terms of assets, received $63 million from investors on Friday. This marks the end of daily outflows that had been occurring for almost four months since its conversion to a spot ETF structure in January.  -Rocio Fabbro, Melvin Backman, and Britney Nguyen contributed to the article  Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

    "title": "Warren Buffett says he was ‘100% responsible’ for Berkshire Hathaway’s bad bet on Paramount: ‘We lost quite a bit of money’",
    "description": "“It was 100% my decision, and we sold it all,” the Oracle of Omaha said at Berkshire’s annual meeting on Saturday.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-06T19:31:55Z",
    "content": "Warren Buffett made a bad call with Paramount and said he made sure Berkshire Hathaway got out before the stock fell more. At Berkshire’s annual meeting on Saturday, 93-year-old CEO Buffett told shareholders that he was directly responsible for the company’s Paramount share purchases in 2022, but that the company had now changed course. “I was 100% responsible for the Paramount decision,” Buffett said. “It was 100% my decision, and we sold it all and we lost quite a bit of money, and that happens in this business, too.” Berkshire had already cut its holdings of the media company—which owns the film production company Paramount Pictures, broadcaster CBS, and the streaming service Paramount+—by a third from 93.7 million shares to 63.3 million shares that were worth about $930 million at the end of 2023. Buffett had previously been critical of streaming, saying in an April interview with CNBC that Paramount “isn’t fundamentally that good a business,” even as Berkshire was invested in the company. At the time, he was ambivalent, saying, “We’ll see what happens.”  The company’s bum Paramount bet made Buffett think deeper about the industry, he told shareholders. “I certainly thought harder even about the whole question of what people do with their leisure time and what the governing principles are of running an entertainment business of any sort, whether it’s sports or movies or whatever it might be,” Buffett said. Several interested parties have targeted Paramount for acquisition, including Sony and private equity firm Apollo and David Ellison’s Skydance Media. On Sunday, Paramount officially opened negotiations with Sony and Apollo, the New York Times reported. Berkshire Hathaway reported a $12.7 billion profit for the first quarter, a drop from the $35.5 billion it netted in the same quarter a year prior. The decline was mostly due to a drop-off in the paper value of its holdings, and Buffett encouraged investors to look instead at the company’s operating earnings, which exclude its investments. The company’s operating earnings skyrocketed 39% year over year, coming in at about $11.2 billion. The annual meeting over the weekend was the first since Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger died in November at the age of 99. Buffett seemed reflective as he noted Munger’s absence, wrapping up the meeting with somber thoughts. “I not only hope you come next year. I hope I come next year,” he said. Still, when it comes to his stock bets, the legendary investor was just as keen as ever, and even at 93 years old, learning from his mistakes—the hard way. “I think I’m smarter now than I was a couple years ago,” Buffett said. “But I also think I’m poorer because I acquired the knowledge in the manner I did.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

    "content": "One of American finance's biggest moguls saw an AI deepfake of himself, and it seems to have freaked him out. In a shareholder meeting over the weekend, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett admitted that he saw an AI doppelganger of himself that was so good, it impressed and terrified him. During a Q&A portion of the investor call, Buffett said that although he couldn't have explained how the deepfake was made, he was sure, from what he saw, that it's going to \"be the growth industry of all time.\" \"Based on the one I saw recently,\" the billionaire said, \"I practically would send money to myself over and over in some crazy country.\" Buffett also referenced his comments last year likening AI to the advent of nuclear weapons. \"We let a genie out of the bottle when we developed nuclear weapons and that genie has now been doing some terrible things lately, and the power of that genie scares the hell out of me,\" he opined. \"I don't know any way to get the genie back into the bottle.\" \"AI is somewhat similar, it's part [of the] way out of the bottle and its enormously important, and it's going to be done by somebody so we may wish we'd never seen that genie,\" the Oracle of Omaha continued. While it's unclear what deepfake of himself Buffett saw, there have been fairly recent reports about videos spoofing his likeness. As Media Matters reported in December, a video of the finance mogul taking to Fox News to promote to promote crypto — which he has quite publicly come out against on repeated occasions — was indeed an AI fake. \"I am watching a bitcoin giveaway take part [sic],\" the spoofed Buffett said in the video, which has since been flagged by Instagram for being altered. \"If you want to change your future, go to the website anloko.com, enter promo code 'gift' and enjoy your prizes, 0.3 BTC. Do not miss the opportunity that will change your life.\" Representatives for both Buffett and Fox News later confirmed to Reuters that the video was a fake — and given the timing, there's a non-zero chance that it was the same video the billionaire saw.

    "description": "Известный инвестор и генеральный директор компании Berkshire Hathaway Уоррен Баффет выразил свое опасение по поводу быстрого развития технологий искусственного интеллекта, сравнив их потенциальное воздействие с ядерным оружием, сообщает портал breitbart.com.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-06T19:20:06Z",
    "content": "По его словам, мошенничество с использованием искусственного интеллекта, способное обманом заставить обычных людей поверить практически во что угодно, может стать для преступников \"самой быстрорастущей индустрией всех времен\". Миллиардер полагает, что искусственный интеллект в чем-то похож на ядерное оружие. Он уже частично вышел из-под контроля, и это чрезвычайно важно. Люди могут пожалеть, что выпустили этого джинна из бутылки. В то же время, ИИ может творить удивительные вещи. Опасения инвестора-миллиардера проистекают из личного опыта, когда он обнаружил видео с своим изображением, сгенерированным искусственным интеллектом и передающим сообщение, автором которого он не был и не одобрял. Баффет опасается, что подобные случаи могут открыть шлюзы для потенциальных мошенников. Несмотря на свои опасения, Баффет считает, что ИИ обладает огромным потенциалом. Он подчеркнул, что имеет ограниченное представление об этой технологии, но признал ее важность для формирования будущего. Учредитель ФГБУ «Редакция «Российской газеты» Главный редактор В.А.

His image and voice were recently replicated by an AI-backed tool, he said, and they were so convincing that they could have fooled his own family. Scams using these deep fakes, he added, will likely become increasingly prevalent.\n     \n            “If I was interested in investing in scamming, it’s going to be the growth industry of all time,” he told the crowd.\n     \n            Berkshire Hathaway has started employing some AI in its own business to make employees more efficient, said Greg Abel, the expected successor to Buffett who runs Berkshire’s non-insurance operations, on Saturday.\n     \n            “At times it displaces the labor, but then hopefully, there’s other opportunities,” said Abel, who didn’t reveal much detail about how the company plans to use AI.\n     \nRelated article\nWarren Buffett’s favorite market indicator is flashing red\n \n            Buffett also acknowledged that the technology could change the world for the better, but said he isn’t sold yet. “It has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm,” he said. “And I just don’t know how that plays out.”\n     \n            The AI explosion has already transformed workplaces across the world and nearly 40% of global employment could be disrupted by AI, according to the International Monetary Fund. Industries from medicine to finance to music have already felt its effects.\n     \n            Shares of companies associated with the AI boom have soared. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is up about 215% over the last 12 months, while Microsoft (MSFT) is up about 34%.\n     \n            Shares of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A), have increased by 22% over the same period.\n     \n            Buffett isn’t the only major business figure expressing concern about AI scamming.\n     \n            JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual shareholder letter last month that while he doesn’t yet know the full effect AI will have on business, the economy or society, he knows its influence will be significant.\n     \nRelated article\nCEOs of OpenAI, Google and Microsoft to join other tech leaders on federal AI safety panel\n \n            “We are completely convinced the consequences will be extraordinary and possibly as transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years: Think the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the Internet, among others,” the JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO wrote in the letter.\n     \n            Dimon also recognized the risks that come with the AI boom. “You may already be aware that there are bad actors using AI to try to infiltrate companies’ systems to steal money and intellectual property or simply to cause disruption and damage,” he wrote.\n     \n            In January, JPMorgan Chase said it had seen a sizable increase in daily attempts by hackers to infiltrate its systems over the last year, highlighting the escalating cybersecurity challenges the bank and other Wall Street firms are facing.\n     \n            JPMorgan Chase, the world’s largest bank by market capitalization, is also exploring the potential of generative AI within its own ecosystem, Dimon said. Software engineering, customer service and operations and general employee productivity are all getting AI makeovers.\n     \n            Forty-two percent of CEOs surveyed at the Yale CEO Summit last summer said AI has the potential to destroy humanity five to 10 years from now, according to survey results shared exclusively with CNN.\n     \n            “It’s pretty dark and alarming,” Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld said of the findings.\n     \n            Sonnenfeld said the survey included responses from 119 CEOs from a cross-section of business, including Walmart CEO Doug McMillion, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincy, the leaders of IT companies like Xerox and Zoom as well as CEOs from pharmaceutical, media and manufacturing.\n     \n            Dozens of AI industry leaders, academics and even some celebrities have signed a statement warning of an “extinction” risk from AI.\n \n            That statement, signed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Geoffrey Hinton, the “godfather of AI” and top executives from Google and Microsoft, called for society to take steps to guard against the dangers of AI.\n     \n            “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war,” the statement said.\n     \n  Additional reporting by Matt Egan.\n Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

    "content": "Redfin has agreed to pay $9.25 million to settle federal lawsuits that claim U.S. homeowners were saddled with artificially inflated broker commissions when they sold their home as a result of longstanding real estate industry practices Redfin has agreed to pay $9.25 million to settle federal lawsuits that claim U.S. homeowners were saddled with artificially inflated broker commissions when they sold their home as a result of longstanding real estate industry practices. The online brokerage and real estate services company disclosed the proposed settlement Monday in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The settlement, which Redfin agreed to Friday, would resolve pending class action lawsuits filed in federal court in the Western District of Missouri, and also shield the company, its subsidiaries and agents from similar cases around the country, according to the filing. \"Resolving this litigation now and removing uncertainty is in the best interest of the company, our employees, and our investors,” the company said in a statement Monday. Seattle-based Redfin noted that it doesn't expect the settlement, which must be approved by the court, to have a material impact on its future operations, adding it expects to record a $9.25 million pre-tax charge for the quarter ended March 31. Shares in Redfin were up 3.7% in afternoon trading Monday. Redfin is the latest big brokerage to agree to settlement terms in order to put an end to lawsuits related to the real estate industry's broker compensation structure, following Re/Max, Keller Williams Realty, Compass and Anywhere Real Estate. Last month, HomeServices of America, which is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, agreed to pay $250 million to settle the lawsuits. And in March, the National Association of Realtors agreed to pay $418 million. All told, the real estate industry has now agreed to pay more than $950 million to make the lawsuits go away. The lawsuits′ central claim is that the country’s biggest real estate brokerages and the NAR violated antitrust laws by engaging in business practices that required home sellers to pay the fees for the broker representing the buyer. Attorneys representing home sellers in multiple states argued that homeowners who listed a property for sale on real estate industry databases were required to include a compensation offer for an agent representing a buyer. And that not including such “cooperative compensation” offers might lead a buyer’s agent to steer their client away from any seller’s listing that didn’t include such an offer.  In October, a federal jury in Missouri ordered the National Association of Realtors and several other large real estate brokerages to pay nearly $1.8 billion in damages. The defendants were facing potentially having to pay more than $5 billion, if treble damages were awarded. The verdict in that case, which was filed in 2019 on behalf of 500,000 home sellers in Missouri and elsewhere, led to multiple similar lawsuits being filed against the real estate brokerage industry. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

    "published_at": "2024-05-06T18:45:00Z",
    "content": "  Home » Stocks Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) held its annual meeting in Omaha this past Saturday. Of course, Berkshire meetings are always filled with lots of takeaways and insights from Buffett, dubbed the “Oracle of Omaha” for his successful investing endeavors. Saturday’s meeting also marked the release of the conglomerate’s first-quarter earnings results, which were a bit of a mixed bag. Overall, it was a good earnings report, but the bottom-line numbers may appear to suggest differently, which may have confused some investors as Berkshire stock was pretty volatile on Monday morning. Let’s dive into the results. With Berkshire Hathaway’s earnings, you have to read between, around, and over the bottom line because it is not always indicative of the company’s performance. That’s because the eighth-largest company in the world by market cap is a conglomerate that holds a $370 billion stock portfolio and owns some 41 companies across a variety of industries, including insurance, retail, construction, transportation, utilities, energy, manufacturing, railroads, and others. Many are household names like GEICO, Dairy Queen and Duracell. Thus, Berkshire’s stock portfolio often skews its bottom-line results in a given quarter because portfolio earnings are included — even though the losses or gains are unrealized. In other words, the stocks contained in the company’s portfolio haven’t been sold, so they represent just temporary losses or gains. In the first quarter, the portfolio performed far worse than it did in the first quarter of 2023. Thus, Berkshire Hathaway only had $1.5 billion in unrealized investment gains in Q1, compared to the blowout results reported for the first quarter of 2023, when it generated $27.4 billion in unrealized stock-market gains.  Over time, the Berkshire Hathaway stock portfolio has posted an average annual return of about 20%, so you cannot put too much emphasis on the quarter-to-quarter or year-over-year fluctuations.  What you can measure is the operating earnings from the businesses the conglomerate owns, and those were very good. Berkshire Hathaway saw its operating earnings rise 38% year over year to $11.2 billion on $89.9 billion in revenue (up 5%). The conglomerate notched significant increases on its insurance holdings and energy businesses, which buoyed its overall results. Insurance underwriting was particularly strong with earnings of $2.6 billion, up from $911 million in Q1 2023.  Berkshire Hathaway’s bottom-line results don’t look great, as its net earnings plunged 64% year over year to $12.7 billion, or about $5.88 per share. In reality, it was actually a good quarter for the company, as it beat both revenue and operating-earnings estimates.  However, Berkshire’s stock price was all over the place on Monday, up initially, then in the red, then back up as investors tried to figure out where the company stood at the end of 2023. In the first quarter, Berkshire Hathaway boosted its cash to a record level of about $189 billion — from $167 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. That reflects its strong earnings and the fact that the company did not make any major investments in the quarter.  “We just haven’t seen anything that makes sense,” Buffett said at the annual meeting, according to Yahoo Finance.  In fact, in the question-and-answer session at the annual meeting, Buffett said the company scaled back its largest position, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and dumped all of its Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) stock.  According to CNBC, Berkshire pared its holdings in Apple by about 13%. As for Paramount, which is in heated merger discussions and has struggled mightily, Buffett took responsibility for the bad investment. “It was 100% my decision,” Buffett said of Paramount. “I lost money, and I did it all by myself.”  More details on Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio moves will come out later this month when it releases its 13F filing. There is always a lot to chew on after Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting, and we’ll have more coverage on it. However, as for the quarterly results, don’t fret the bottom line; it is still a good buy.  Never Miss A Story! Subscribe to ValueWalk Newsletter.

Attorneys representing home sellers in multiple states argued that homeowners who listed a property for sale on real estate industry databases were required to include a compensation offer for an agent representing a buyer. And that not including such ''cooperative compensation'' offers might lead a buyer's agent to steer their client away from any seller's listing that didn't include such an offer. In October, a federal jury in Missouri ordered the National Association of Realtors and several other large real estate brokerages to pay nearly $1.8 billion in damages. The defendants were facing potentially having to pay more than $5 billion, if treble damages were awarded. The verdict in that case, which was filed in 2019 on behalf of 500,000 home sellers in Missouri and elsewhere, led to multiple similar lawsuits being filed against the real estate brokerage industry. © 2024 StarTribune.

You can opt out anytime.\t\t\t\t “Fairly recently, I saw an image in front of my screen. It was me, and it was my voice and wearing the kind of clothes I wear,” Buffett said. “My wife or my daughter wouldn’t have been able to detect any difference. And it was delivering a message that in no way it came from me.” When asked by a shareholder about his view on investing in A.I., Buffett claimed he doesn’t “know anything about A.I.” but added that “that doesn’t mean I deny its existence.” Reflecting on his recent encounter with the technology, the 93-year-old investor seemed concerned. “A.I. has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm,” he said. “When you think about the potential for scamming people…Scamming has always been part of the American scene. If I was interested in investing in scamming—it’s gonna be the growth industry of all time.” Buffett compared the rapid development of A.I. to the emergence of nuclear weapons—of which he is a vocal opponent—echoing an analogy he’d made at last year’s shareholder meeting. “We let the genie out of the bottle when we developed nuclear weapons, and that genie has been doing some terrible things,” he said. “The power of that genie scares the hell out of me. And I don’t know of any way to get the genie back in the bottle. And A.I. is somewhat similar. It’s part of the way out of the bottle.” Buffett is known to be cautious about investing in new technologies that he doesn’t understand, no matter how popular they seem. Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio was oddly missing major tech holdings for years. It didn’t make its first tech bet until 2016 when acquiring some 10 million shares of Apple (AAPL). Since then, Berkshire has ramped up Apple shares to be its top position. In recent quarters, Berkshire has unloaded millions of Apple shares. During the first three months of 2024, the value of the conglomerate’s Apple holding dropped 22 percent to about $135 billion from $174 billion, the company revealed in its first-quarter earnings on Saturday. Still, Buffett remains bullish on Apple’s future. On Saturday, he said the iPhone is one of the greatest products of all time and that Apple is an even better stock than American Express and Coca-Cola, two of the other top holdings in Berkshire’s portfolio. Despite Buffett’s disinterest in investing in A.I. companies, he might not be immune to the technology’s impact. At one point of Saturday’s meeting, a shareholder asked how Berkshire’s stock-picking businesses could be disrupted by A.I. Buffett predicted that the tech would affect “anything that’s labor sensitive” and “create an enormous amount of leisure time” for human workers as a result. However, he didn’t get into how A.I. could threaten job security and replace human workers in his industry. Greg Abel, Berkshire’s head of energy businesses and Buffett’s successor apparent, added that “we’re in the early innings” of understanding the impact.

    "content": "Peter Kafka, Chief Correspondent covering media and technology        What's going to happen to Paramount, the once-mighty media conglomerate? No one knows! Maybe the son of one of the world's richest men will buy it. Maybe Sony and Apollo, the big private equity company, will buy it. Maybe no one buys it, and it has to try to muddle through with an ungainly three-man leadership group running the place. Anyway, Warren Buffett isn't sticking around to find out. The famed investor, who not very long ago owned 15% of Paramount, disclosed over the weekend that his Berkshire Hathaway holding company has sold its entire stake in the company this year. \n                              Related stories\n                             \"I was 100% responsible for the Paramount decision,\" Buffett told attendees at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting. \"It was 100% my decision, and we've sold it all, and we lost quite a bit of money.\" So how much is \"quite a bit of money?\" Berkshire Hathaway hasn't disclosed the total amount (I've asked). But when someone who's worth an estimated $132 billion says \"quite a bit of money,\" it's probably a very big amount. By my very rough estimates, it could be something in the $1.5 billion range. The math: In 2022, Berkshire accumulated 91 million shares of Paramount B shares; Barron's estimates he paid \"more than $30\" per share. That's a $2.7 billion investment. At the end of 2023, Berkshire announced it had sold off around 28 million of those shares during the last three months of the year. Per Bloomberg data, Paramount's average closing price during the quarter was $13.39. So, let's assume Berkshire was able to sell those shares for something in the $374 million range. That left Berkshire with another 63.3 million Paramount shares at the beginning of 2024, and sometime between then and Saturday they have sold off the rest. Paramount's average during that timeframe was $12.38. That suggests Berkshire got another $784 million from those sales. Add all that up, and it looks like Berkshire sold its Paramount stake for $1.2 billion after paying $2.7 billion for it — a $1.5 billion loss. Which does indeed seem like \"quite a bit of money.\" \n                              Read next\n                             Jump to"

    "content": "Anyone who runs a business understands that they’re likely to face a few risks in running day-to-day operations. A whole host of accidents and injuries can occur – affecting both customers and staff. Natural disasters or human errors can cause property damage, resulting in a temporary loss of trading – even business closure. Unfortunately, these incidents can sometimes result in legal action, which is costly and time-consuming for everyone involved. It doesn’t matter how well prepared a company is for any such event, incidents can still arise that are beyond anyone’s control. What any good business owner can do is help to insure themselves against the kinds of financial issues that arise when disasters and accidents occur. An established, reliable insurance provider such as biBerk can assist with all of the above (and much more). As part of the Berkshire Hathaway Group, they’ve spent decades focusing on providing exceptional business insurance to companies needing to protect their assets and look after their staff. Here’s a comprehensive review of all the different forms of business insurance coverage that biBerk offers – including who can benefit from them – and crucially, what you don’t necessarily need to invest in. There are a whole host of insurance companies out there and they all offer business insurance in different forms. Sometimes, deciding what’s needed and when can seem like a complicated process. Some companies favor a simple approach. They’ll purchase one policy that covers all the individual risks they might face. This can work well for some, but it might not be the right option for others. The team at biBerk recognizes that it’s better to offer a few different types of policies – each providing coverage for specific types of business risks. Individuals can decide what suits them best and tailor coverage to their specific needs. It’s worth taking time to research all the different kinds of policies offered by biBerk. Why might a company choose separate policies instead of one blanket policy? Many business owners find that they can customize their coverage – meaning they can pay for what they need. A general liability insurance policy covers many companies for most of the common risks they face. For businesses with employees, workers compensation insurance is essential. However, it’s worth pointing out that in some cases, solopreneurs may benefit from this form of insurance too. Customer-facing businesses may want to invest in professional liability insurance – it covers professional errors. E&O (or errors & omissions) is another name for the same type of coverage. For companies that own or lease vehicles, commercial auto insurance is a must-have to ensure cars, vans, and trucks are covered in the event of accidents. Commercial umbrella insurance can offer extra coverage once a liability policy has reached its limit. Perhaps one of the most sought-after and non-negotiable policies these days is cyber insurance to protect businesses from the effects of cyber attacks. Deciding to purchase small business insurance of any kind is a big step. You may have questions surrounding the type of policy and coverage that’s needed. That’s why biBerk has simplified the process – saving business owners time and money – and providing quick coverage. All their insurance policies are available to purchase online, and you can get instant quotes so you know what you’ll pay.  It’s never been easier to get comprehensive coverage that aligns with most budgets – no matter how tight. Business insurance costs will vary depending on how many policies are taken out, the size of the company, and the number of employees. biBerk offers competitive rates, and in many cases, can cut the cost of existing policies. They can do this because they don’t use agents or brokers, so savings can be passed on to customers. A business insurance policy isn’t a guarantee that accidents or other incidents won’t happen – no one can predict the future, after all. However, many business owners have worries about how best to support themselves and their employees when issues arise. Business insurance coverage provides peace of mind so that if the worst happens, it reduces the impact on company finances and day-to-day operations. Comprehensive insurance coverage from biBerk offers a way for companies to protect their operations and look after their employees. \nMembers of the editorial and news staff of the Daily Caller were not involved in the creation of this content.\n  ©2024 The Daily Caller, Inc.

    "published_at": "2024-05-06T17:15:10Z",
    "content": "Investing legend Warren Buffett is something of a white whale for Tesla fans—reeling him in as a stakeholder verges on a Captain Ahab–style obsession.  Landing the Berkshire Hathaway chair, a proponent of the same buy-and-hold philosophy prevalent among Tesla’s small shareholder base, would be the ultimate seal of approval for the EV maker. Conversely, the fact that the world’s savviest investor does not back Elon Musk, but rather his chief competitor, China’s BYD, rankles, since it calls into question the view that their totemic CEO is the Thomas Edison of our lifetime. On Sunday, Musk renewed his appeal to the Oracle of Omaha to bless him and his company with a confidence-boosting investment. Responding to a post by Galileo Russell, former nonexecutive director of failed EV startup Arcimoto, who urged Buffett to buy Tesla shares, Musk agreed. He should take a position in Tesla. It’s an obvious move. “He should take a position in Tesla,” Musk wrote. “It’s an obvious move.”  Previously such an investment was unlikely, as Buffett’s trusted friend and business partner Charlie Munger was not a fan of Musk. “Munger could’ve invested in Tesla at ~$200M valuation when I had lunch with him in late 2008,” Musk revealed last February in a post that suggested no further discussions had been held in the subsequent 15 years.  Berkshire Hathaway spokesman Marc Hamburg could not be reached by Fortune for comment.  Munger could’ve invested in Tesla at ~$200M valuation when I had lunch with him in late 2008 Munger’s passing in November, shortly before his 100th birthday, could in theory open the door to an investment by Berkshire Hathaway—Buffett is at least more admiring of the entrepreneur. But he also tends to make safe bets in companies with strong brands like Apple and Coca-Cola or when he spots blood in the water, such as with his purchase of Goldman Sachs shares at the height of the Lehman crisis. Tesla by comparison has an unpredictable CEO who just sacked his entire Supercharger team—long considered an unbeatable strategic advantage—and is pivoting away from its core business selling cars toward robo-taxis and robotics. At 56x estimated earnings for next year, the multiple isn’t attractive either for a value-minded investor like Buffett.   Trying to be useful lately! pic.twitter.com/TlPF9YB61W The outlook for Musk’s EV business has darkened considerably as well. First-quarter global sales of Tesla dropped not just sequentially over the final three months of 2023, but year on year as well. That was the first such decline since the pandemic brought the global economy to a complete standstill in early 2020.  The latest sign that Tesla’s car business is under severe pressure came on Monday, when Germany’s motor vehicle authority published new car registrations for the month of April.  Tesla volumes dropped by a third over the previous year’s period, when EV makers still benefited from generous government subsidies that expired in December. Tesla Robotaxi unveil on 8/8 Sales of Tesla cars in Germany are now down by 36% through the first four months. It is unclear how much if at all production stoppages at its Berlin plant may have affected the figure, as Tesla has plenty of finished cars in its inventory.  The decline is reflective of a broader malaise that led some to speculate Tesla volumes could even dip in 2024 for the full year, despite assurances last month by Musk that they will increase even if the rate of growth will be “notably lower” than 38% from last year. While Buffett is renowned for sniffing out undervalued companies, whether that includes Tesla at this point remains to be seen. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Il compare cette technologie à croissance rapide au développement de la bombe atomique, affirmant que les deux pourraient avoir des conséquences dévastatrices sur la société, si elles sont mal utilisées. L’homme de 93 ans s’est exprimé lors de la réunion annuelle de Berkshire Hathaway, conglomérat et société d’investissement dont il est le PDG, à Omaha dans le Nebraska. “Nous avons laissé sortir un génie de la bouteille lorsque nous avons développé des armes nucléaires. L’IA est un peu la même chose : elle est en partie sortie de la bouteille”, a-t-il affirmé. Pour l’homme d’affaires, les nouvelles technologies de l’IA comportent un potentiel immense, mais également de grands risques. Il ajoute que l’IA “a un énorme potentiel de bien et un énorme potentiel de mal. Je ne sais pas comment cela va se passer.” Prenant l’exemple d’un deepfake, montages créés par l’intelligence artificielle, il illustre les opportunités dévastatrices que pourraient avoir les technologies de l’IA dans le futur. Pour Warren Buffett, ces technologies ont un potentiel considérable dans le milieu de l’escroquerie. “Si je souhaitais investir dans l’escroquerie, ce serait le secteur le plus porteur de tous les temps”, a-t-il assuré.

    "content": "\n\tThe \n\t1792 Exchange, a corporate bias watchdog seeking to restore political neutrality in the boardroom and to altogether combat woke capital, has released another damning batch of insights into the extent of the ideological capture at America's Fortune 10 companies.\n \n\tThe watchdog's recent analysis — critical additions to a growing database that tracks the political preferences of board members and leaders inside Fortune 250 companies' C-suites — indicates that executives from America's top 10 companies, taken in aggregate, direct the super-majority of their political giving to Democrats. The 1792 Exchange further highlighted various public remarks suggestive of executives' prioritization of left-wing activism in the name of so-called stakeholders over results and returns for those shareholders who have everything on the line.\n \n\tThe 1792 Exchange indicated that executives from Fortune 10 companies give 77% of their political donations to Democrats and only 23% to Republicans. The political bias is especially clear at Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet, where the ratio of political giving to Democrats over Republicans apparently exceeds 9:1. Of the three corporate behemoths, 97%, 97%, and 95% of political donations went to Democrats, respectively.\n  \nTwo outliers among the Fortune 10 in this regard are Chevron and Walmart, where 81% and 69% of political donations from executives and board members went to Republicans.\n  \n\tMatt Buckham, vice president for programs at the 1792 Exchange, told Blaze News, \"What we see is instead of having a fair representation of viewpoints, instead of having a clear understanding that we are serving the shareholder, we see a massive tilt of 'We favor one party’s political opinions, one party’s ideas, one party’s ideology.'\"\n \nBuckham suggested that these executives should alternatively be focused on the business — on \"doing what's good for the shareholder, what's good for the customer, and making the best product or service possible. Activism is the complete opposite of that.\"\n \n\t\"We don't want them to take harmful, left-wing, Democratic activist viewpoints and ideologies and incorporate them in a business with the pretense that it's helping the shareholders,\" continued Buckham. \"We're trying to help companies avoid another Bud Light moment.\"\n \n\tIn an apparent effort to signal its woke alignment, Bud Light collaborated last year  with transvestite influencer Dylan Mulvaney, \n\tcelebrating his supposed \"365 Days of Girlhood.\" The leftist activism hurt the company and shareholders by extension.\n \n\tA boycott reacting to the company's apparent mockery of women successfully \n\ttook Bud Light out of the ranking of America's list of top 10 beers, cost Anheuser-Busch tens of billions in market value, and prompted a purge of corporate employees. According to the Harvard Business Review, Bud Light's sales decline persisted for around eight months.\n \n\tIt is unclear whether the executives at America's Fortune 10 companies — Walmart, Amazon, ExxonMobil, Apple, UnitedHealth Group, CVS, Berkshire Hathaway, Alphabet, McKesson, and Chevron — have taken the Bud Light lesson to heart. It is clear, however, that many are predisposed to a potentially costly leftward drift.\n \n\tReferencing public statements made by company directors in recent months and years, the 1792 Exchange report indicated that ESG and DEI are baked into executives' conversations and considerations.\n \n\tThe report highlighted, for instance, former PepsiCo. CEO and current Amazon Audit Committee chairman Indra Nooyi's sense that discriminatory hiring policies are the way forward.\n \n\t\"You have to put some quotas and numbers in place to get the appropriate critical mass of diverse people in,\" Nooyi is quoted as \n\tsaying at a 2022 leadership event in Dubai. \"Don't look at quotas as something bad. It's bad if it's not in the early stages. So if it's in the early stages, start with a quota. Insist that the numbers get to 25[-]30% diverse people.\"\n \n\t\"[Inclusion] starts with numbers and then becomes a mindset,\" continued Nooyi.\n \n\tNooyi is evidently not the only race obsessive with priorities besides profitability at Amazon.\n \n\tAndy Jassy, the company's president and CEO, reportedly said, \"If you knew what a lot of the senior leaders at Amazon spend their time on when they're not at work. They spend their time on issues of racial equality. People are very passionate about it. I spend a lot of my time on that, too, so I care a lot about it.\"\n \n\tIt appears even the directors at ExxonMobil have waved on the leftist march through corporate institutions.\n \n\tThe 1792 Exchange highlighted how \n\tGregory Goff, an independent director at the oil giant since 2021, is among those who have bought into stakeholder capitalism contra shareholder capitalism.\n \n\t\"I would hope that a director or directors would never compromise those plans and [ESG] programs by maybe challenging how much money is being spent on the things that are the most important to do,\" \n\tsaid Goff.\n \n\tThings are no better at the UnitedHealth Group where the company's so-called chief innovation officer Dame Vivian Hunt appears to be of the mindset that the company must embrace an activist role. Hunt\n\tnoted at an Imperial College Business School conference, \"We want to lead responsibly. Stakeholder capitalism is a framework to do so. It's new harmony with a brain, a balance sheet, as well as a heart.\"\n \n\tOver at Google's parent company Alphabet, board member Roger Ferguson Jr., is apparently of the mind that capitalism is broken and needs to be fixed.\n \n\t\"Business leaders must embrace a new definition of capitalism that puts a greater emphasis on social responsibility and equity,\" Ferguson \n\tsaid at a 2021 gala where he was being honored. \"The Business Roundtable took meaningful steps toward that goal when it redefined the purpose of the corporation to include a commitment to all stakeholders.\"\n \n\tPaul Tice, an adjunct professor of finance at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University, indicated in his recent book, \"The Race to Zero: How ESG Investing Will Crater the Global Financial System,\" that stakeholder capitalism theory, which began making the rounds in management circles around the 1960s, \"argues that modern enterprises must serve not only shareholders but all company stakeholders — including employees, suppliers, and customers as well as the state, the economy, and society at large.\"\n \n\tTice suggested that stakeholder capitalism, particularly the kind championed by Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum, is built upon a corporatism \"doubtless influenced by an engineering flow-chart mindset and a Prussian need to order society\" that is \"basically a collectivist political ideology with a dark lineage.\"\n \n\tBuckham told Blaze News, \"There's no end to what a stakeholder is or who a stakeholder is, so anybody and everybody can be one, they're loud.\"\n \n\t\"We're just saying [to company executives], 'Stop listening to everybody. Focus on your company — on what you do well, who you actually serve as the shareholder — and your company will do well,\" continued Buckham.\n \n\tJust as Consumers' Research provides consumers with insights into how they can avoid giving woke companies their hard-earned cash, the 1792 Exchange — named in tribute to the founding of the first American stock exchange in 1792 — seeks to both chasten top executives and help investors \"make sure that they know what's going on in the companies they're invested in.\"\n \n\tBuckham indicated that the 1792 Exchange will keep furnishing investors with insights so they can avoid woke companies and have a hand in turning things around for the better.\n Like Blaze News?

Berkshire posted a 39% yearly jump in operating profit, while cash holdings are approaching $200 billion. Micron Technology — The Boise, Idaho-based semiconductor company jumped 4.5% following an upgrade from Baird to outperform from neutral. The analyst cited valuation, incrementally positive trends in dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, pricing and growing demand for high-bandwidth memory. Spirit Airlines — The discount carrier slid 9% after posting a loss of $1.46 per share in the first quarter, wider than a FactSet consensus estimate from analysts of a $1.45 loss per share. Revenue matched expectations. Spirit also forecast second-quarter revenue between $1.2 billion and $1.34 billion, below a FactSet estimate of $1.46 billion. Paramount — Shares popped 3.3% following a report that the owner of Paramount Pictures and CBS Entertainment Group began formal acquisition negotiations with a group led by Sony Pictures Entertainment and Apollo. Elsewhere, Warren Buffett said over the weekend that he sold the entire Berkshire stake in Paramount at a loss. United States Steel — The Pittsburgh-based steelmaker saw its shares rise more than 2% after Morgan Stanley upgraded it to overweight from equal weight. U.S. Steel shares have room to rise due to internal improvements, even if the Nippon Steel buyout deal collapses, Morgan Stanley said in a note. Medical Properties Trust — Shares dropped nearly 7% after a major tenant of the company's, the physician-owned hospital operator Steward Health Care, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. EHang Holdings — The autonomous aircraft stock surged 9% after Morgan Stanley initiated coverage with an overweight rating, calling the company \"primed for takeoff\" amid growing regulatory and governmental support in China. Tyson Foods — The food processor saw its shares drop 6% after posting revenue of $13.07 billion in its fiscal second quarter, which was short of the $13.15 billion expected by analysts polled by StreetAccount. Tyson also reported earnings of 62 cents per share, beating estimates of 39 cents per share. Bausch + Lomb — Shares of the eye health stock popped 4.4% on the back of a Morgan Stanley upgrade to overweight from equal weight. Morgan Stanley said the market is likely overlooking the Canadian-based company's progress on improving core profit margins. Coinbase — The crypto stock rose 2.5% after Barclays hiked its price target, implying less downside ahead for shares. The bank's move comes after Coinbase reported better-than-forecast earnings last week. Li Auto — The Chinese electric vehicle maker gained 2.3% after reporting strong orders for its L6 vehicles. In the April 18 to May 5 period, orders for L6 vehicles exceeded 41,000, according to a Weibo post. Victoria's Secret — Shares of Victoria's Secret was almost 2% higher after opening about 0.4% lower. Morgan Stanley downgraded the intimate apparel maker to underweight due to expectations for negative earnings per share revisions. The Wall Street bank also trimmed its price target. — CNBC's Alex Harring, Jesse Pound, Samantha Subin, Hakyung Kim and Sarah Min contributed reporting. Got a confidential news tip?

    "content": " Related Stories You're unlikely to see Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett adding artificial intelligence stocks to his vast portfolio anytime soon. At the annual meeting of Berkshire shareholders on Saturday, Buffett fielded a question about AI's impact on traditional industries, and said he didn't know anything about the technology, but \"that doesn't mean I deny its existence or importance or anything of the sort.\" One of AI's applications that stuck out to the legendary investor: its potential utility for fraudsters. \"When you think about the potential for scamming people ... if I was interested in investing in scamming, it's gonna be the growth industry of all time and it's enabled, in a way,\" Buffett said. Buffett would go on to compare the invention of AI to the development of the atomic bomb. Here's what he said. Buffett relayed an experience he had where he encountered an AI-generated version of himself online. \"I saw an image in front of my eyes on the screen, and it was me, and it was my voice,\" he said. \"And wearing the kind of clothes I wear, and my wife or my daughter wouldn't have been able to detect any difference. And it was delivering a message that no way came from me.\" Buffett saw firsthand what the Federal Trade Commission and others have been warning consumers about: the enormous potential for bad actors to use deepfake and voice cloning technology to part people with their cash. \"Based on the one I saw recently, I practically would send money to myself over in some crazy country,\" Buffett joked. Capitalist that he is, Buffett understands that AI could be a world-changing technology — one that could be used for good or ill. Buffett likened AI to the development of nuclear weapons, a technology he describes as a \"genie\": powerful and world-changing and unable to return to the bottle from which it came. \"AI is somewhat similar. It's partway out of the bottle, and it's enormously important, and it's going to be done by somebody,\" he said. \"We may wish we'd never seen that genie, or it may do wonderful things.\" The future of AI will come down to the way that those in power use it, Buffett said. \"I don't have any advice on how the world handles it, because I don't think we know how to handle what we did with the nuclear genie,\" he said. \"But I do think, as someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, that it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm. And I just don't know how that plays out.\" Want to make extra money outside of your day job? Sign up for CNBC's new online course How to Earn Passive Income Online to learn about common passive income streams, tips to get started and real-life success stories.

Η φράση με την οποία ο προφήτης της Όμαχα έκλεισε την καθιερωμένη συνέλευση με τους μετόχους Έχει κλείσει τα 93 έτη και έχασε μέσα στην περασμένη χρονιά τον πιστό του συνεργάτη και συνοδοιπόρο στο επιχειρείν, Τσάρλι Μάνγκερ, που έφυγε από τη ζωή σε ηλικία 99 ετών. Αλλά ο Γουόρεν Μπάφετ εξακολουθεί να έχει απόλυτη διαύγεια, να πραγματοποιεί επενδυτικές επιλογές, που παρακολουθούν στενά οι traders ανά τον κόσμο και να κρατάει γερά το τιμόνι της Berkshire Hathaway. Εκτός από δισεκατομμυριούχος επενδυτής, ο «προφήτης της Όμαχα», όπως αποκαλείται για την ικανότητά του να προβλέπει ευκαιρίες και κινδύνους, είναι και άνθρωπος και έχει πλήρη συναίσθηση της θνητότητάς του. Αυτό διεφάνη και στις δηλώσεις που έκανε κατά την πρόσφατη γενική συνέλευση των μετόχων – την πρώτη στην οποία κλήθηκε να απαντήσει σε ερωτήσεις μόνος, χωρίς να έχει στο πλευρό του τον Μάνγκερ. Ο Μπάφετ, σύμφωνα με ρεπορτάζ του CNBC, έκλεισε τη συνάντησή του με τους μετόχους, με την ακόλουθη φράση: «Ελπίζω όχι μόνο να έρθετε και την επόμενη χρονιά. Ελπίζω να είμαι και εγώ εδώ την επόμενη χρονιά». Παρόλα αυτά είχε φροντίσει να καθησυχάσει τους επενδυτές νωρίτερα, διαβεβαιώνοντας ότι υπάρχει σχέδιο διαδοχής του και συνέχειας της εταιρείας. Αποκάλυψε μάλιστα για πρώτη φορά ότι ο Γκρεγκ Άμπελ, τον οποίο έχει ήδη επιλέξει ως διάδοχο, στο εξής θα λαμβάνει τις πιο σημαντικές επενδυτικές αποφάσεις. Παράλληλα εξήγησε γιατί η Berkshire πούλησε μέρος της συμμετοχής της στην Apple και αποκάλυψε ένα αποτυχημένο στοίχημα στην Paramount. Ο πρόεδρος και διευθύνων σύμβουλος της Berkshire εξέτασε επίσης τις εξελίξεις στον ταχέως εξελισσόμενο τομέα της τεχνητής νοημοσύνης και επαίνεσε το έργο του προέδρου της Federal Reserve Jerome Powell που κατευθύνει όπως είπε την οικονομία σε σταθερό μονοπάτι.

    "content": "Fund next-gen business journalism with $10 a month Search Free Newsletters The stock market kicked the week off on a strong note as investors gained confidence that the Fed would cut rates later this year. This week’s focus will be on earnings reports from Disney, Uber and Airbnb.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped roughly 0.25%, or 96 points, to 38,771. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 both gained 0.5%. Warren Buffett admittedly isn’t an expert on artificial intelligence — but what he does know makes him nervous. Speaking at a question-and-answer session at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders conference Saturday, Buffett likened the advent of AI to his views on nuclear weapons. In its latest earnings report, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire reported $21 billion in cash and Treasuries, bringing it to a record $189 billion last quarter — a 13% increase in just three months. In the same quarter, Berkshire offloaded a net $17 billion worth of stocks and bought back $2.6 billion worth of its own stock, up from $2.2 billion in the prior quarter. The stock was flat in mid-morning trading with a 0.33% jump. Micron Technology’s stock gained over 4.5% after Baird upgraded it to outperform from neutral, saying there is plenty of room for growth for shares. So far, in 2024, Micron Technology Inc. shares are up 40%.  Last month, the semiconductor manufacturing company was reported to receive $6.1 billion in CHIPS and Science Act funds to build chip fabrication plants (fabs) in central New York and Idaho. The Biden administration said the investments across New York and Idaho would create 70,000 jobs. Spirit Airlines reported its 10th consecutive quarterly loss of $160 million and expects another loss next quarter. The airline still has $1.5 billion in debt that it has to pay off in the next couple of years. Its debt due 2025 is trading at 73 cents on the dollar, and its 2026 debt is at 55 cents.  Following the news, the stock declined 9.5% in mid-morning trading.  Bitcoin rebounded to $64,000 on Monday morning after experiencing a significant decline last week. The latest surge in Bitcoin price comes amid the resurgence of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF has finally seen inflows. According to data compiled by Farside, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is the biggest Bitcoin ETF in terms of assets, received $63 million from investors on Friday. This marks the end of daily outflows that had been occurring for almost four months since its conversion to a spot ETF structure in January.  -Rocio Fabbro, Melvin Backman, and Britney Nguyen contributed to the article  Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Paris a gagné 0,49 %, Francfort 0,96 % et Milan 1,06 % pour la première séance d’une semaine qui s’annonce calme en indicateurs et résultats d’entreprises. Londres était fermée en raison d’un jour férié. Le Bel 20 a quant à lui terminé en hausse, +0,47 %, porté par la progression d’Umicore à +4,90 %. La société d’investissement du célèbre investisseur multimilliardaire américain Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway, a publié des résultats supérieurs aux attentes des analystes samedi et progressait de 0,30 % à Wall Street. Le fonds a aussi indiqué qu’il avait vendu une partie de sa participation dans Apple, son principal investissement. Apple reculait de 0,84 %. Vendredi après l’annonce de ses résultats, Apple avait bondi de près de 6 %. L’allemand BASF (+0,84 %) a choisi la société américaine International Process Plants (IPP), spécialisée dans la reprise et la revente de sites industriels, pour placer sur le marché d’anciennes unités de production d’ammoniac, de méthanol et de mélamine sur le site de Ludwigshafen, dont le géant chimique en crise a annoncé la fermeture en février 2023. Les détails de la transaction n’ont pas été divulgués. Les prix du pétrole rebondissaient vers 15H50 GMT après un net reflux tout au long de la semaine passée. Le prix du baril de Brent de la mer du Nord pour livraison en juillet gagnait 0,57 % à 83,43 dollars et son équivalent américain, le baril de West Texas Intermediate (WTI), pour livraison en juin, prenait 0,61 % à 78,59 dollars. Sur le marché des changes, le yen reculait de 0,55 % face au dollar, à 153,90 yens pour un dollar. La devise nippone a connu la semaine dernière des fortes volatilités, touchant un plus bas depuis 34 ans, et semble avoir bénéficié de deux interventions des autorités japonaises. Quant à l’euro, il prenait 0,15 % par rapport au billet vert, à 1,0778 dollar pour un euro. Le bitcoin valait 63.500 dollars, en légère baisse de 0,39 %. L'avis des Brokers sur Colruyt, Umicore et GBL : Colruyt (-2,2 % à 42,38 euros) a vu sa couverture reprise à “réduire” chez Kepler Cheuvreux, avec un objectif fixé à 40 euros. “Le cours a doublé depuis 2022, et l’action affiche de nouveau une prime par rapport aux concurrents. Nous pensons qu’elle ne se justifie pas au vu du rendement plus faible. Elle se justifierait si la marge se redresse vers sa moyenne historique ou si la famille décide de retirer Colruyt de la bourse”. Il souligne toutefois qu’il ne voit pas pourquoi la famille serait pressée de réaliser une telle opération, vu qu’elle n’a pas profité de la baisse du cours pour le faire. Umicore (+4,1 % à 22,08 euros) a été confirmé à “accumuler” chez KBC Securities, l’objectif étant fixé à 26 euros. “Suite aux récentes rumeurs concernant un potentiel retard dans la construction de l’usine d’ACC, le groupe a confirmé qu’il ne devrait pas y avoir de délais concernant les livraisons à ACC dans le cadre du contrat qui prend effet plus tard dans l’année”. L’analyste reste convaincu que le groupe est bien placé pour prendre une place de choix dans l’électrification des transports. GBL (-0,4 % à 70,95 euros) a été confirmé à “acheter” chez Kepler Cheuvreux, l’objectif étant relevé de 87 vers 89 euros. Cette révision est intervenue suite à la publication des chiffres trimestriels, avec des flux de dividendes ressortis au-dessus des attentes. “Le groupe pourrait en conséquence annoncer une hausse de son dividende lors des chiffres semestriels”.

A Berkshire Hathaway, empresa do bilionário Warren Buffett, se desfez de 13% das suas ações da Apple no primeiro trimestre de 2024, de acordo informações da CNBC. Esse número é o equivalente a 116 milhões de papéis da fabricante do iPhone; mesmo com essa venda, a Maçã continua sendo o maior investimento da companhia. Esse é o segundo trimestre seguido em que a Berkshire vende ações da Apple. No final do ano passado, ela vendeu 1% da sua participação na empresa, o que era o equivalente a “apenas” 10 milhões de ações. Em uma reunião com acionistas em Omaha, no estado do Nebraska (Estados Unidos), Buffett deu a entender que a venda das ações teria sido uma manobra para evitar o pagamento de impostos, e não que ela teria a ver com uma possível preocupação com a avaliação da Apple. Não me incomoda nem um pouco preencher aquele cheque e eu realmente espero que, com tudo o que a América fez por todos vocês, não deveria incomodá-los que estejamos fazendo isso, e se estou fazendo isso com 21% neste ano — e estamos fazendo isso com uma porcentagem um pouco maior e mais tarde —, não acho que vocês realmente se importarão com o fato de termos vendido um pouco de Apple este ano. O valor da participação da Berkshire na Apple caiu de US$174,3 bilhões, no fim de 2023, para US$135,4 bilhões em 31 de março (-22%), sendo que as ações da gigante Cupertino caíram 11% no último trimestre. Buffett, vale lembrar, já elogiou a Apple diversas vezes e até a elegeu como um de seus investimentos mais importantes. A Maçã chegou a representar 40% de todo o portfólio da Berkshire Hathaway. Ainda segundo o investidor de 92 anos de idade, a Apple deverá se manter como o principal investimento da sua companhia, a menos que “algo drástico aconteça”. Ver comentários do post"

    "content": "A Powerful Database with iCloud Sync You’re Warren, and your job is to deliver newspapers. Apple anniversaries come and go. Some mark important milestones in the company’s history. Others celebrate products that have had outsized impacts on the world. Both have their place, but I prefer Door Number 3: Weird Apple Anniversaries. That’s why today, on its fifth anniversary, it’s worth taking a moment to solemnly reflect on the legacy of one of Apple’s least culturally significant software releases ever: Warren Buffet’s Paper Wizard. I regret to say that I didn’t cover Warren Buffet’s namesake paper-tossing arcade game in 2019. So, to make amends, let’s take a look back at this gem that dropped out of nowhere five years ago today.  Source: CNBC To understand why Warren Buffet’s Paper Wizard was made, you really only need to know one thing. In 2019, Warren Buffett, who is known for his ability to pick stocks, was one of the biggest investors in Apple via his company Berkshire Hathaway. That remains as true today as it was then, with Apple stock currently making up nearly 50% of Berkshire Hathaway’s stock portfolio, amounting to over 5% of Apple’s issued stock. 2019 was the tail end of Buffet’s initial buying spree of around $35 billion of Apple stock. So it’s not too surprising that Tim Cook turned up for Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting that year with a funny video,1 as noted by Leif Johnson at Macworld at the time: \n  As the Omaha World-Herald reports, Apple made Warren Buffet’s Paper Wizard for one of Apple’s dad-jokey video shorts, and this one was shown for Apple CEO Tim Cook’s visit to Berkshire-Hathaway’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, this weekend. In the video, Buffet attempts to come up with good app ideas at an Apple facility, and Cook recommends a newspaper-throwing game based on Buffet’s early job as a paperboy.\n However, Apple went a step beyond playing the game idea for laughs at the shareholders’ meeting. A couple of days after the event, the company released the game on the App Store for anyone to download and enjoy. Warren Buffet’s Paper Wizard is a sort of first-person newspaper shooter reminiscent of Atari’s Paperboy. The game opens with an upbeat banjo jingle that loops endlessly through the first level, lodging in your brain like a sun-shiny mind virus. You start on the streets of Omaha, Buffet’s hometown, advancing automatically past homes, streets, cars, and flocks of birds.  At the bottom of the screen is a newspaper. Your job is to deliver the paper to each house and barn highlighted with a glowing blue target. Some targets are close and pass out of range quickly, while others are distant and harder to hit. Along the way, cars and birds block your path, complicating your targeting. Near the end of the first level, you advance to delivering papers to larger apartment buildings and offices, aiming at their windows. A new town, more papers to deliver. For the game’s second and final level, Paper Wizard transitions to Cupertino, California, and a more melodic soundtrack. The landscape changes to a suburban street lined with ranch homes and glass office buildings before ending at Apple Park, where you circle the inner ring of the building, delivering your papers. At the end of each level, your score is tallied, and when the game ends, you’re prompted to enter your name, which is added to a leaderboard. The final punchline of the game is that no matter how well you play, you’ll never beat Warren Buffet’s score. I know because I managed a few perfect scores back in 2019. A leaderboard that can’t be topped no matter what you do. Warren Buffet Paper Wizard was briefly released worldwide but pulled a week later from every store except the US App Store. That’s not too surprising. I suspect the joke of it all was too obtuse for many Americans, let alone a worldwide audience. At some point later, the game was pulled from the US App Store, too, but it remains available to re-download if you snagged the game before it disappeared. You can still download Warren Buffet’s Paper Wizard if you snagged a copy in 2019. Paper Wizard is not a great iOS game. In fact, its two levels play more like a demo or proof of concept than a full-blown game, so it’s not surprising that it is no longer available. At the same time, though, the game represents a bit of Apple history. It was the first game Apple had produced in a decade, following Texas Hold’em.2 It also highlights just how important Warren Buffet had become to Apple as an investor – a fact as true today as it was then – which is why I’m glad it is still available to re-download even if no one will ever dub it a classic iOS videogame. Many of these apps are already gone. But being able to re-download apps and games that are no longer on the App Store isn’t enough. Recently, we migrated 15 years of images on MacStories to a new service provider. In the process, Federico, Robb, and I ran across app after app and game after game that was no longer on the store and that we’d forgotten about. It was fun to enter that time capsule, but it also made me acutely aware that for many apps and games, there is nothing left but those screenshots, which is why we took great pains to make sure they were preserved in the transition.  However, those apps and games deserve more than a handful of screenshots on MacStories and scattered across the Internet. Apple recently began allowing ‘retro game console’ emulators on the App Store. That lets fans play games on apps like Delta, enjoying titles from classic Nintendo systems. Apple should allow the equivalent to be done with early versions of iOS. They can define ‘retro iOS distros’ as whatever version of the OS is no longer supported by recent hardware and then allow .ipa files to be sideloaded by customers. There’s no evidence Apple would ever allow old versions of iOS to be emulated. In fact, there’s ample evidence to the contrary, which is a shame. There are apps like Tweetie that invented modern touch gestures, games like Super Monkey Ball that pioneered the integration of the iPhone’s accelerometer into its gameplay and kicked off the spiraling downward pressure on app prices, and apps like I Am Rich that helped put the early App Store gold rush into perspective. Every app and game tells a story, and without Apple’s participation in preserving those stories, they’ll inevitably be lost.

    "content": "       Warren Buffett should buy Tesla stock, according to Elon Musk. \"He should take a position in Tesla. It's an obvious move,\" Musk tweeted about Buffett on Sunday, in response to a tweet that suggested Berkshire Hathaway should sell its entire $135 billion stake in Apple and instead purchase Tesla. The comments came a day after Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, in which the company revealed that it did trim some of its stake in Apple by about 10%. \n                              Related stories\n                             But Musk's dream of Berkshire Hathaway giving Tesla its stamp of approval and buying the stock is probably never going to happen. That's because previous comments made by Buffett and the late Charlie Munger did not shine a favorable light on the ultra-competitive automotive industry.  To be fair, Buffett and Munger are no strangers to investing in electric vehicle makers, as Berkshire Hathaway did acquire a 10% stake in BYD back in 2008, so anything could happen. But despite their successful BYD investment, Buffett and Munger said at Berkshire Hathaway's 2023 annual shareholder meeting that investing in the automotive industry is just too hard. \"Charlie and I for long have felt that the auto industry is just too tough. It's just a business where you've got a lot of worldwide competitors they're not going to go away. And it looks like there are winners at any given time, but it doesn't get you a permanent place,\" Buffett said at the time. \"I think I know where Apple's going to be in five or ten years... I don't know what the car companies are going to be in five or ten years,\" Buffett added. Those sentiments were backed up by Munger, who said that while electric vehicles are experiencing wild growth, they also come with huge capital costs and risks. \"It's imposing huge capital costs and huge risks, and I don't like huge capital costs and huge risks,\" Munger said. This isn't the first time Musk suggested Berkshire Hathaway should invest in Tesla.  \n                              Read next\n                             Jump to"

    "title": "Why the S&P 500 Rose for the Second Straight Week",
    "description": "The S&P 500 ticked up about half a percentage point last week to 5,128, marking the second straight week of gains for the large-cap index.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-06T15:13:01Z",
    "content": "  Home » Stocks The S&P 500 ticked up about half a percentage point last week to 5,128, marking the second straight week of gains for the large-cap index. All of the major indexes gained last week, led by the small-cap Russell 2000, which rose 1.6% to 2,035. The Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.4% to 16,156, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.1% to 38,676. The markets continued to trend higher on Monday morning, again led by the Russell 2000, which rose almost 1% in morning trading. Will the indexes continue their winning streaks this week? It wasn’t good news from the Federal Reserve that boosted the markets, mainly, the Nasdaq and Russell 2000. Instead, it was more a lack of bad news. The Fed did not take any action on rates following the April 30-May 1 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), and none was expected.  However, the markets took it as a positive when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in the post-meeting press conference that the next Fed action would not likely be a rate hike. That alleviated a lot of fear that interest rates might tick back up as inflation rose in March.  As a result, the markets moved higher, especially small caps and the technology sector, which tend to be more affected by higher rates. The other big news last week was earnings results from two of the Magnificent Seven: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon had a strong first quarter, with net sales jumping 13% and net income rising some 225%, led by growth in Amazon Web Services. Amazon stock jumped nearly 4% last week.  Apple, the laggard among the Magnificent Seven, beat earnings estimates but did not have a great quarter, as its revenue declined from the same quarter a year ago. However, guidance for revenue gains in Q2 and a huge $100 billion stock buyback plan, along with upcoming product releases, gave investors hope that the iPhone maker will bounce back.  That comeback started last week, as Apple stock was one of the top performers on the S&P 500, surging 8.3% last week.  The Magnificent Seven have now all posted their quarterly earnings results, and for the most part, they were strong. However, that strength has not necessarily translated into gains for the overall market, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each fell about 4% in April, their first losing month since October.  While the Mag-7 companies may be done posting their latest results, there are some other big names posting earnings numbers this week, starting with Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) on Tuesday. Disney has been the best performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average year-to-date, soaring 26% The company’s proxy challenge is now behind it after improvements in expense management and streaming earned it a vote of confidence among investors. Analysts expect a strong quarter, estimating an 18% year-over-year increase in revenue. We’ll see if the House of Mouse delivers. Also this week, social-media company Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) is scheduled to issue its first earnings report as a public company on Tuesday, Meanwhile, semiconductor companies Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) and Allegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM) are due to report Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. The markets may also have gotten a lift early Monday from the solid first-quarter earnings results reported by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) on Saturday. Other support may be stemming from some hopeful anticipation for the upcoming speeches by the presidents of the New York, Richmond, Va., and Minneapolis, Minn. Federal Reserve banks, which are scheduled for Monday and Tuesday. Investors will be looking for more insight on interest rates and are hoping for good news.  Never Miss A Story!

    "content": "Warren Buffett, o bilionário de 93 anos e presidente-executivo da Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A; BRK.B; BERK34), refletiu sobre seu futuro ao dizer aos acionistas no sábado que, se tiver sorte, terá mais seis ou sete anos de vida, mas acrescentou que “isso pode acabar amanhã”.   \n  Dezenas de milhares de acionistas, que durante o fim de semana fizeram sua peregrinação para ver o bilionário pessoalmente na reunião anual de acionistas da Berkshire, esperam que sua vida não acabe tão cedo. Mas eles não estão preocupados com seus investimentos. “As multidões serão menores quando Buffett não estiver aqui, mas a empresa continuará indo bem”, disse Jason Garner, um estudante de 20 anos da Queens University em Kingston, no Canadá. A Berkshire é um conglomerado de 865 bilhões de dólares cujas dezenas de empresas incluem Geico, BNSF, Dairy Queen, além de muitas empresas de serviços públicos e negócios industriais. Buffett gere a empresa em sua cidade natal, Omaha, no Estado norte-americano de Nebraska, desde 1965. Apesar do tamanho da Berkshire, suas ações superaram o índice S&P 500 na última década, embora em menor proporção do que no passado. Muitos dos que compareceram ao fim de semana que Buffett apelidou de “Woodstock para capitalistas” expressaram confiança, às vezes com um toque de inquietação, sobre o futuro da Berkshire sem o lendário bilionário. A morte, em novembro, do parceiro de negócios de longa data de Buffett, Charlie Munger, aos 99 anos, renovou o foco na idade do próprio Buffett. Buffett respondeu a quase cinco horas de perguntas dos acionistas em uma arena no centro da cidade com seu sucessor, o vice-presidente Greg Abel, de 61 anos. “Warren disse que a Berkshire foi construída para durar”, disse Mike Lin, analista financeiro na China. Lygia Bulle, planejadora financeira de Curitiba, levou seus filhos de 17 e 19 anos para a reunião. “Warren Buffett é o maior investidor do mundo”, disse ela. “Ir vê-lo pessoalmente tem um impacto diferente de vê-lo em casa.” Como de costume, milhares de acionistas fizeram fila durante a madrugada de sábado para ouvir Buffett, apesar da chuva e do vento que encurtaram as filas. Alguns disseram que havia pessoas esperando 12 horas antes da abertura da arena, às 7h da manhã. A fama, a sabedoria e o magnetismo de Buffett são uma grande parte da atração. Abel não terá a mesma afeição dos acionistas, embora os líderes das empresas da Berkshire digam que o têm em alta conta. Buffett reconheceu que o momento em que não estará mais presente chegará, talvez em breve, e caiu na gargalhada depois de dizer aos acionistas: “Não só espero que vocês venham no próximo ano, como também espero que eu venha no próximo ano.” Com cobertura incomparável em mais de 16 idiomas e alcançando bilhões de pessoas em todo o mundo todos os dias, fornecemos inteligência confiável que capacita humanos e máquinas a tomarem decisões inteligentes.

    "content": "Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has voiced his apprehension about the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, comparing its potential impact to that of nuclear weapons. Buffett warned that AI-powered scams, with their ability to trick everyday people into believing practically anything, could be “the growth industry of all time” for criminals. Quartz reports that during the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders conference held on Saturday, Warren Buffett addressed questions from attendees and shared his thoughts on various topics, including the rise of AI. Despite admitting that he has very little knowledge about artificial intelligence, Buffett expressed his unease about the technology’s potential consequences. Buffett drew parallels between AI and his views on nuclear weapons, recalling his remarks from the previous year’s conference where he described the atomic bomb as a genie let out of the bottle that has been causing terrible things and scares him. He stated, “AI is somewhat similar, it’s part way out of the bottle, and it’s enormously important and it’s gonna be done by somebody. We may wish we’d never seen that genie, or it may do wonderful things.” deepfake Mark Zuckerberg (The Washington Post / Getty) The billionaire investor’s concerns stem from a personal experience where he discovered a video using his likeness generated by AI, delivering a message that he had not authored or approved of. Buffett worries that such instances could open the floodgates for potential scams, labeling it as “the growth industry of all time.” Despite his apprehension, Buffett acknowledged that AI has enormous potential for both good and harm. He emphasized his limited understanding of the technology but recognized its significance in shaping the future. “I do think, as someone who doesn’t understand a damn thing about about it, that it has enormous potential for good, and enormous potential for harm,” he said. “And I just don’t know how that plays out.” The annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders conference, often referred to as “Woodstock for Capitalists,” attracts thousands of investors eager to hear insights from Buffett, widely regarded as one of the most successful investors in history. This year’s conference, held in Omaha, Nebraska, saw Buffett joined by Berkshire Hathaway vice chairs Ajit Jain and Greg Abel on the panel. Prior to the conference, Berkshire Hathaway reported impressive financial results, including a record cash and Treasuries pile of $189 billion, marking a 13 percent increase in just three months. The company also experienced a 39 percent year-over-year surge in operating profits, reaching $11.22 billion. Read more at Quartz here.

    "description": "Shares of Apple lost 10% of their value in the first four months of the year. This may explain why Apple announced on Thursday that its board authorized $110 billion in stock buybacks, the largest buyback in U.S. history. It may also explain why, on Saturday,…",
    "published_at": "2024-05-06T14:23:20Z",
    "content": " Friends, Shares of Apple lost 10 percent of their value in the first four months of the year. This may explain why Apple announced on Thursday that its board authorized $110 billion in stock buybacks, the largest buyback in U.S. history. It may also explain why, on Saturday, Warren Buffett — the “Oracle of Omaha” — announced that his company, Berkshire-Hathaway, would sell a big portion of its stake in Apple.  It is impossible to understand what’s happening to the American economy without considering the surge of stock buybacks — in which a corporation buys back shares of its own stock to artificially boost its share price, by creating fewer outstanding shares. Large corporations are now devoting nearly 70 percent of their profits to buybacks. Stock buybacks have also become a major force behind widening inequality. They mostly benefit CEOs and the richest 1 percent of the public, who own more than half of all shares of stock owned by Americans.  There is no reason for them. Before Ronald Reagan’s SEC allowed them in 1982, buybacks were treated as illegal stock manipulations in violation of the 1933 and 1934 Securities and Exchange Acts.  Yet they’re still stock manipulations. By using inside knowledge of when and how buybacks are scheduled, corporate executives can time when they exercise their own stock options — which now constitute most of their compensation — to reap maximum benefits for themselves.  Buybacks also impose a huge cost on the economy.  Every dollar spent lining the pockets of CEOs and investors is a dollar less to upgrade equipment and protect workers and the public. Boeing failed to follow through with a promised $7 billion safety redesign of its 737 aircraft while it was spending roughly that much each year on stock buybacks. Norfolk Southern Railroad paid investors $18 billion in buybacks and dividends over the five years before its equipment malfunctioned in the disastrous derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, which released over 300,000 gallons of toxic and flammable chemicals into the air and soil. Abbott Labs spent $5 billion on stock buybacks while allowing plant conditions to deteriorate to the point where bacterial contamination of baby formula resulted in infant deaths and a nationwide formula shortage. Money spent on buybacks also means less money for research and development, which hobbles American competitiveness at a time when China is breathing down our necks.  Apple now spends twice as much on stock buybacks as on R&D. Over the last fiscal year, Apple doled out $78 billion on buybacks. Intel, the largest chip maker in America, with revenues last year of $54 billion, was recently awarded an $8.5 billion grant from the federal CHIPS and Science Act, plus $11 billion in subsidized loans.  But Intel fritters away its profits on stock buybacks. Its website proudly touts that it has spent $152 billion on stock buybacks since 1990. There’s no way to be sure Intel isn’t using CHIPS money for stock buybacks. As Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen noted: “While the legislation specifically prohibits the use of CHIPS funds for stock buybacks and dividend payments, these restrictions do not explicitly prohibit award recipients from using CHIPS funds to free up their own funds, which they can then use for those purposes.” As if all this weren’t bad enough, stock buybacks provide an added incentive for companies to monopolize their industries and keep prices high.  A new Roosevelt Institute analysis found that the 10 largest publicly traded fast-food corporations spent $6.1 billion on buybacks last year. At the same time, they hiked prices to consumers. The  average markup in the fast-food industry jumped 8.4 percent last year, while markups for firms across all industries grew 6.2 percent. Fast-food corporations lasts year charged prices 27 percent above the marginal cost of production. According to Oxfam’s recent report, America’s 200 largest corporations are more profitable than ever. Net profits soared to $1.25 trillion in 2022, a 63 percent increase over 2018. But 90 percent of that sum was paid out to shareholders ($448 billion as dividends and a record $681 billion as stock buybacks). And because CEO pay is linked to share prices, CEO pay is through the roof. The typical worker’s pay is higher than it was two years ago, adjusted for inflation, but it is still in the cellar.  In sum, the social costs of stock buybacks continue to surge.  What’s the answer to all this?  Ban stock buybacks — as they were banned before 1983.   Professor Reich: in my opinion, ronald reagan was a corporate-beholden criminal. he was the beginning of the decline of this country into the pursuit of money and power at all costs, the reversal of this country's progress towards equality, and the sacrifice and destruction of the natural spaces around the globe on the altar of profits. if anyone who ever occupied the white house could be thought of as beezebub's earthly incarnation, ronnie raygun would be it. Wow!  Lately, every time I hear about Reagan, it reminds me of what a terrible president he was, what a destructive guy when it came to our economy.  It is interesting just how simple it would be to fix one of the really big inequity problems with our economy, stop stock buybacks.  Congress could do that, but alas, there are so many super rich guys who just must have their stock buybacks to feed their insatiable money and power habit that the reps and senators who have been purchased by those corporations couldn't possibly do the right thing and vote to stop the insanity of stock buybacks.  Reagan whined about \"welfare queens\" when he was helping to create stock buyback kings who, unlike the welfare queens, exist in significant numbers and will not stop unless stopped.  So, we need serious pressure to stop them.  If their corporations are so worried about stock prices that fluctuate so they have to pay more than R&D for stock buybacks, they probably shouldn't be in business or should have better management.

Inoltre, ritiene che farà la fortuna dei truffatori.                             Mentre gli USA chiedono a Cina e Russia di non affidare la gestione delle armi nucleari all'IA, l'oracolo di Omaha, Warren Buffett, ha paragonato l'IA alla bomba atomica. Parlando all'annuale meeting con gli azionisti di Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett ha esposto le sue preoccupazioni sull'intelligenza artificiale e il profondo impatto che potrebbe avere sul mondo. \"Ho avuto un'esperienza che mi ha reso un po' inquieto. Recentemente ho visto un'immagine sullo schermo, ero io con la mia voce. Indossava il tipo di vestiti che indosso. Mia moglie o mia figlia non sarebbero state in grado di rilevare alcuna differenza.

Potremmo desiderare di non aver mai visto quel genio, o potrebbe fare cose meravigliose\". Nonostante le forti preoccupazioni, Buffett ritiene anche che l'IA abbia il potenziale di portare \"benefici straordinari\" se gestita correttamente. \"Ovviamente l'intelligenza artificiale ha anche un potenziale positivo, ma...

    "published_at": "2024-05-06T13:57:48Z",
    "content": "OMAHA, Neb. — Warren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, expressed cautious optimism about the potential societal benefits of Tesla’s self-driving technology during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting while acknowledging the potential impact on the company’s insurance businesses, particularly Geico. In response to a shareholder question about how Elon Musk’s fully autonomous driving goal might affect Geico’s revenue and underwriting margins, Buffett emphasized that any significant reduction in accidents would be a net positive for society, even if it reduces business for auto insurers. “Anything that reduces accidents is going to reduce costs, but that’s been harder to do than people have thought before,” Buffett said. “If it really happens, the figures will show it, our data will show it, and prices will come down.” Buffett highlighted that while dramatically reducing traffic accidents benefits society, it could impact insurance company volumes, noting that insurance businesses must be flexible and adaptive to changing circumstances.  Tesla’s push toward fully autonomous vehicles has the potential to reshape the auto insurance industry. However, insurers like Geico and other Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries are grappling with how to quantify and price the risks associated with self-driving technology. Warren Buffett noted the inherent challenge in predicting the impact of self-driving cars on insurance rates. “Insurance always looks easier than it is,” he said. “It’s so much fun because you get the money at the start, and then you find out whether you’ve done something stupid later on.” Elon Musk’s assertion that autonomous driving can reduce accidents by 50% has yet to convince Buffett and his insurance team fully. Ajit Jain pointed out that the cost of repairs for technologically advanced vehicles like Tesla’s could offset any gains from a reduced accident rate. “Even if accidents are reduced, the repair costs for technologically sophisticated vehicles can be substantially higher,” Jain said. “Tesla’s vehicles are equipped with sensors, cameras, and other high-tech features that can drive up the cost of repairs.” Moreover, there remains uncertainty regarding the liability framework for autonomous vehicles. If a fully self-driving car gets into an accident, it raises questions about who should be held responsible—the driver, the car manufacturer, or the software provider. This ambiguity complicates the underwriting process and creates additional risks for insurers. Another concern for insurers is the accuracy of autonomous vehicle performance data. While Tesla gathers extensive real-world driving data to demonstrate the safety of its self-driving features, independent validation, and regulatory scrutiny will be crucial to ensuring the reliability of this data. Finally, the long-term adoption rate of autonomous vehicles could significantly influence the insurance landscape. While early adopters may embrace self-driving technology quickly, widespread adoption could take years or even decades. Insurers must balance the old and new underwriting models during this transition, creating additional complexity. Buffett remains pragmatic, noting that while autonomous technology will benefit society, insurance companies must adapt their business models to these new realities. He stressed that insurers would need to innovate and rethink traditional underwriting practices. “We’re always looking to be adaptable,” Buffett emphasized. “It’s a dynamic business, and we must keep an open mind about the future.” The intersection of self-driving technology and insurance is an evolving story that both Tesla and Berkshire Hathaway will continue to watch closely as automation progresses toward Musk’s vision of fully autonomous driving. While Tesla’s technological advances in self-driving cars challenge traditional insurers like Geico, they also present an opportunity for Tesla itself. In recent years, the company has shown growing interest in disrupting the auto insurance industry by offering its in-house insurance products. Elon Musk’s vision is clear: leverage Tesla’s unparalleled access to vehicle data to provide insurance tailored to each driver’s specific behavior and risk profile. Musk claims this data-driven approach will enable Tesla to offer lower premiums to drivers who demonstrate safe driving habits, ultimately improving road safety and customer satisfaction. In 2019, Tesla launched its first insurance product in California, promising savings of up to 20% for Tesla owners. Since then, the company has expanded its insurance program to several additional states and plans further expansion. Despite the initial setbacks and slower-than-expected growth, Tesla remains committed to scaling its insurance operations globally. Tesla Insurance relies heavily on real-time data from vehicles, including information on braking patterns, speed, acceleration, and Autopilot engagement. This data generates a personalized safety score for each driver, directly influencing their insurance premiums. Musk has emphasized that this approach provides a more accurate risk assessment than traditional insurance models. However, Ajit Jain, Berkshire Hathaway’s vice chairman overseeing insurance operations, remains skeptical of Tesla’s ambitious foray into insurance. “Tesla has been toying with the idea of writing insurance directly or indirectly, and so far, it hasn’t been much of a success,” Jain said. “Time will tell, but automation just shifts much of the expense from the operator to the equipment provider.”  Despite Jain’s reservations, Tesla Insurance is attracting attention from analysts and industry experts for its innovative model. If successful, it could challenge long-standing practices in the auto insurance industry by leveraging big data and machine learning to create a more dynamic and personalized pricing structure. Yet, Tesla faces considerable challenges in scaling its insurance business. Regulatory hurdles, the complexity of underwriting, and the need to build substantial reserves are significant barriers to entry. Moreover, the reliability of Tesla’s real-time driving data remains a topic of debate, as independent verification and regulatory oversight will be critical to gaining consumer trust. Additionally, the company will have to navigate the legal complexities surrounding liability for self-driving vehicles. If a Tesla vehicle operating in full self-driving mode causes an accident, questions arise about whether the driver or Tesla should be held responsible. Warren Buffett acknowledged that while Tesla Insurance may challenge traditional insurers, the competition will ultimately benefit consumers. “Anything that reduces accidents is going to reduce costs, and that’s good for society,” Buffett said. “But it’s certainly going to make the insurance business much more competitive.” Tesla’s ambitions in the insurance space signal a broader trend where technology companies seek to disrupt traditional industries through data-driven innovation. While it remains to be seen whether Tesla can scale its insurance operations profitably, its vision aligns with a future where autonomous vehicles reshape transportation and the insurance landscape. The rise of autonomous vehicles represents a paradigm shift in the automotive industry, and one of the most significant implications is the way costs are redistributed across stakeholders. In traditional insurance models, drivers bear the brunt of the financial risk through premiums. However, with the advent of self-driving technology, this risk is increasingly shifting from the driver to the manufacturer. Ajit Jain, Berkshire Hathaway’s vice chairman overseeing insurance operations, highlighted this shift, noting, “Automation just shifts a lot of the expense from the operator to the equipment provider.” As vehicles become more reliant on complex software and hardware systems to navigate autonomously, the liability for accidents could increasingly fall on automakers like Tesla rather than individual drivers. One primary driver of this shift is the rising cost of repairs for advanced vehicles. Autonomous cars are equipped with high-tech sensors, cameras, and computing systems that can significantly inflate repair costs in the event of a collision. Even minor accidents can result in expensive repairs due to the delicate nature of these components. This is particularly evident with Tesla vehicles, where the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) hardware is intricately integrated into the vehicle’s body and infrastructure. In 2021, the Highway Loss Data Institute found that the average repair cost for Tesla vehicles was notably higher than that of traditional cars. This increase was attributed to the sophisticated technology embedded in the vehicles, which requires specialized expertise and parts to repair. For insurers, this translates into higher claim payouts, potentially offsetting the benefits of fewer accidents due to autonomous technology. Additionally, the nature of autonomous driving itself shifts some of the traditional costs associated with human drivers. With fewer accidents expected from fully autonomous vehicles, insurers may see a reduction in claims frequency. However, the severity of remaining claims could be higher due to the increased repair costs, leading to a potential increase in overall loss ratios for insurers. This shift also raises questions about liability. If a fully autonomous vehicle causes an accident, is the driver still responsible, or does the liability fall on the manufacturer? This legal ambiguity complicates the underwriting process for insurers and requires clear regulatory frameworks to address liability concerns. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 stipulates that insurers will be liable for self-driving car accidents. Still, they can recover costs from the manufacturer if the vehicle is at fault. Elon Musk has addressed these concerns by emphasizing Tesla’s commitment to making autonomous driving safer than traditional human driving. However, the company’s efforts to launch its insurance product underscore the recognition that automation shifts costs and liabilities in unprecedented ways. By taking insurance in-house, Tesla aims to understand better and manage these risks directly, thereby reducing costs for itself and its customers. Ultimately, the transition to autonomous vehicles represents both an opportunity and a challenge for insurers like Berkshire Hathaway. Warren Buffett noted, “Anything that reduces accidents is going to reduce costs, and that’s good for society.” However, automakers and insurers must adapt to the new reality where automation shifts costs and fundamentally alters the insurance landscape. The advent of autonomous vehicles marks a significant milestone in the history of automotive innovation. This journey has seen transformative changes since the invention of the automobile in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, the proliferation of cars and the subsequent rise in road accidents led to the establishment of the modern auto insurance industry. Companies like Geico and State Farm emerged to protect drivers from financial ruin, and risk pooling became an integral part of car ownership. Ralph Nader’s 1965 book Unsafe at Any Speed, which exposed the safety defects of American cars, particularly the Chevrolet Corvair, ushered in a new era of automotive safety. This led to the establishment of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the introduction of mandatory safety features like seat belts, airbags, and anti-lock brakes. Over the following decades, road safety improved markedly, with the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled falling from 7.6 in 1950 to under 2.0 in recent years. According to NHTSA data, autonomous vehicles promise to further enhance road safety by eliminating the human errors that account for 94% of serious crashes. If successful, autonomous driving technology could dramatically reduce accidents, thereby saving thousands of lives each year. Warren Buffett acknowledged this potential in his remarks at the 2024 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, stating that “anything that reduces accidents is going to reduce costs, and that’s good for society.” However, the societal impact extends beyond just road safety. The shift towards fully autonomous vehicles could have far-reaching economic implications, particularly for the insurance industry. Historically, auto insurance has been one of the largest and most profitable segments of the insurance market. In 2022 alone, U.S. auto insurers wrote over $260 billion in premiums. However, with the adoption of autonomous vehicles, the frequency of accidents could plummet, potentially shrinking the auto insurance market and affecting the revenue streams of companies like Geico. Moreover, automation could lead to significant changes in employment. The trucking industry, for instance, employs over 3.5 million drivers in the United States. Autonomous trucks, already being tested by companies like Waymo and Aurora, could drastically reduce the demand for human truck drivers, leading to widespread job displacement. Similar disruptions could occur in the taxi and ride-hailing sectors, where fleets of self-driving vehicles could replace drivers. Despite these challenges, the potential societal benefits of autonomous vehicles are substantial. In addition to reducing accidents and saving lives, autonomous vehicles could provide mobility to those who cannot drive, such as the elderly and disabled. They could also reduce traffic congestion and lower emissions through more efficient driving patterns and the adoption of electric vehicle fleets. In this historical context, the rise of autonomous vehicles represents both an evolution and a revolution in automotive technology. It parallels past safety advancements while challenging long-held assumptions about mobility and insurance. As the industry navigates this new landscape, companies like Tesla and Berkshire Hathaway must innovate and adapt to ensure they remain relevant and profitable in the autonomous age. Ultimately, society benefits from these advancements, provided stakeholders address the challenges with foresight and responsibility. The rise of autonomous vehicles presents a transformative moment for the automotive and insurance industries. Warren Buffett’s remarks at the 2024 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting reflect the cautious optimism of a seasoned investor: while Tesla’s vision of fully autonomous driving promises to revolutionize road safety and mobility, it also poses significant challenges to traditional auto insurers like Geico. Tesla’s foray into the insurance market underscores its broader ambition to control every aspect of the vehicle lifecycle. By leveraging its access to proprietary data and integrating insurance directly into the vehicle purchase process, Tesla aims to deliver a seamless customer experience while capturing additional revenue streams. However, this also exposes the company to new risks. If autonomous technology does not meet its lofty safety goals, Tesla could face heightened liabilities that could impact its profitability. For legacy insurers, the road ahead is equally complex. As Buffett acknowledged, the proliferation of autonomous vehicles could shrink the auto insurance market. Insurers must pivot to new business models, possibly focusing on specialized coverage for autonomous vehicles or expanding into adjacent sectors like cybersecurity insurance for self-driving systems. At the same time, automation will likely shift costs from the driver to the manufacturer, potentially increasing the cost per claim even as accident rates decline. This paradoxical scenario demands innovative pricing strategies and new risk assessment models. Insurers must harness advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence to price premiums accurately in an era where traditional risk factors like driving history become obsolete. Beyond the insurance industry, the societal impact of autonomous vehicles could be profound. Reduced accidents and fatalities will benefit public health, while improved mobility could enhance the quality of life for the elderly and disabled. However, the displacement of millions of driving-related jobs could exacerbate economic inequality unless mitigated by proactive policy measures. The collaboration between regulators, manufacturers, and insurers will be crucial. Governments must establish clear guidelines for autonomous vehicle safety and liability while fostering innovation. Automakers and tech companies must prioritize transparency and accountability in their data practices to build consumer trust. Insurers, in turn, should advocate for regulations that promote fair competition while investing in the data infrastructure needed to underwrite the autonomous future. Autonomous driving technology promises a safer, more efficient future on the road. Yet, it also challenges established industries and societal norms in unprecedented ways. The companies that embrace this disruption with agility and vision will be best positioned to thrive in the age of autonomy. With its storied history of adaptation and innovation, Berkshire Hathaway may yet find new opportunities amid the upheaval, just as it has done many times before. As Buffett himself said, “Good for society is what we’re looking for.” The journey to autonomy may be uncertain, but its destination holds tremendous potential for those willing to navigate the twists and turns ahead.

    "content": "Wall Street ouvre à la hausse ce lundi. Dans les premiers échanges, l’indice Dow Jones gagne 179,98 points, soit 0,47 % à 38.855,66 points et le SP 500 progresse de 0,40 % à 5.148,35 points. Nasdaq prend 0,32 % soit 52,21 points, à 16.208,537. Vendredi, les chiffres de l’emploi publiés par le département du Travail ont montré que les tensions se dissipaient sur les marchés du travail, une indication encourageante alors que la hausse des salaires a été l’un des principaux facteurs d’inflation outre-Atlantique. La Réserve fédérale s’est par ailleurs montrée accommodante au cours de sa dernière réunion de politique monétaire, écartant une hausse de taux. “Le rapport sur l’emploi d’avril semble conforme à l’opinion de la Fed – et à la nôtre – selon laquelle les États-Unis continuent de bénéficier d’effets d’offre positifs qui permettent à l’économie de croître à un rythme soutenu sans surchauffe”, constatent les stratégistes de BofA. Berkshire Hathaway a fait état samedi d’un bénéfice trimestriel record, et progresse de 0,9 %. Mais Apple recule de 0,6 % après que Berkshire Hathaway a déclaré samedi avoir réduit de 13 % sa participation dans le groupe, se délestant d’environ 115 millions d’actions Apple. À noter que la semaine s’annonce calme sur les marchés. Lundi, la Bourse de Londres est fermée en raison d’un jour férié (”Early May Bank Holiday”), puis mercredi en France les investisseurs pourraient rester loin des salles de marchés même si la Bourse de Paris demeurera ouverte, en raison de la célébration de la victoire des forces alliées sur l’Allemagne nazie. Jeudi, plusieurs pays européens, dont la France et l’Allemagne, observeront à nouveau un jour férié pour l’Ascension. L’agenda macroéconomique est en outre maigre avec peu d’indicateurs de premier plan attendus cette semaine, hormis les chiffres du PIB et de la production manufacturière et industrielle au Royaume-Uni vendredi. Les marchés surveillent par ailleurs la visite du président chinois Xi Jinping en France. Le président français Emmanuel Macron a appelé lundi à des “règles équitables pour tous” dans les échanges commerciaux entre l’Europe et la Chine. Les prix du pétrole progressaient vers 11H35 GMT, les investisseurs gardant toujours un oeil sur les développements dans le conflit entre Israël et le Hamas.

    "title": "Fãs de Warren Buffett traçam seu próprio caminho para quando ele não estiver vivo",
    "description": "Warren Buffett, o bilionário de 93 anos e presidente-executivo da Berkshire Hathaway, refletiu ...",
    "published_at": "2024-05-06T13:54:53Z",
    "content": "Warren Buffett, o bilionário de 93 anos e presidente-executivo da Berkshire Hathaway, refletiu sobre seu futuro ao dizer aos acionistas no sábado que, se tiver sorte, terá mais seis ou sete anos de vida, mas acrescentou que \"isso pode acabar amanhã\". \n  Dezenas de milhares de acionistas, que durante o fim de semana fizeram sua peregrinação para ver o bilionário pessoalmente na reunião anual de acionistas da Berkshire, esperam que sua vida não acabe tão cedo. Mas eles não estão preocupados com seus investimentos.  \"As multidões serão menores quando Buffett não estiver aqui, mas a empresa continuará indo bem\", disse Jason Garner, um estudante de 20 anos da Queens University em Kingston, no Canadá.  A Berkshire é um conglomerado de 865 bilhões de dólares cujas dezenas de empresas incluem Geico, BNSF, Dairy Queen, além de muitas empresas de serviços públicos e negócios industriais.  Buffett gere a empresa em sua cidade natal, Omaha, no Estado norte-americano de Nebraska, desde 1965. Apesar do tamanho da Berkshire, suas ações superaram o índice S&P 500 na última década, embora em menor proporção do que no passado.  Muitos dos que compareceram ao fim de semana que Buffett apelidou de \"Woodstock para capitalistas\" expressaram confiança, às vezes com um toque de inquietação, sobre o futuro da Berkshire sem o lendário bilionário.  A morte, em novembro, do parceiro de negócios de longa data de Buffett, Charlie Munger, aos 99 anos, renovou o foco na idade do próprio Buffett.  Buffett respondeu a quase cinco horas de perguntas dos acionistas em uma arena no centro da cidade com seu sucessor, o vice-presidente Greg Abel, de 61 anos.  \"Warren disse que a Berkshire foi construída para durar\", disse Mike Lin, analista financeiro na China.  Lygia Bulle, planejadora financeira de Curitiba, levou seus filhos de 17 e 19 anos para a reunião.  \"Warren Buffett é o maior investidor do mundo\", disse ela. \"Ir vê-lo pessoalmente tem um impacto diferente de vê-lo em casa.\"  Como de costume, milhares de acionistas fizeram fila durante a madrugada de sábado para ouvir Buffett, apesar da chuva e do vento que encurtaram as filas. Alguns disseram que havia pessoas esperando 12 horas antes da abertura da arena, às 7h da manhã.  A fama, a sabedoria e o magnetismo de Buffett são uma grande parte da atração. Abel não terá a mesma afeição dos acionistas, embora os líderes das empresas da Berkshire digam que o têm em alta conta.  Buffett reconheceu que o momento em que não estará mais presente chegará, talvez em breve, e caiu na gargalhada depois de dizer aos acionistas: \"Não só espero que vocês venham no próximo ano, como também espero que eu venha no próximo ano.\" +Os melhores conteúdos no seu e-mail gratuitamente.

    "content": "\nPar Mathilde Rochefort\n\n- @mathi_rochefort\n\n \nPublié le 6 mai 2024 à 15h46\n - Mis à jour le 7 mai 2024 à 09h05\n Warren Buffett, célèbre investisseur et milliardaire américain, compare l’intelligence artificielle (IA) aux armes nucléaires. Et il n’est pas le premier acteur de l’industrie à effectuer une telle analogie. L’homme de 93 ans s’est exprimé lors de la réunion annuelle de Berkshire Hathaway, conglomérat et société d’investissement dont il est le PDG, à Omaha dans le Nebraska. « Nous avons laissé sortir un génie de la bouteille lorsque nous avons développé des armes nucléaires. L’IA est un peu la même chose : elle est en partie sortie de la bouteille », a-t-il analysé dans les lignes du Wall Street Journal. Inscrivez-vous à la newsletter En vous inscrivant vous acceptez notre politique de protection des données personnelles. Selon lui, prédire les impacts futurs de la technologie sur le monde s’avère très difficile. « Elle a un énorme potentiel de bien et un énorme potentiel de mal. Je ne sais pas comment cela va se passer », a-t-il précisé. Des propos qui interviennent alors que la place de l’IA dans l’industrie militaire inquiète de plus en plus. Buffett a notamment été subjugué par un deepfake de lui-même. Ces montages créés par l’intelligence artificielle permettent de créer de fausses vidéos de personnes, qui semblent parfois totalement réelles. Il a même estimé que leur potentiel dans le milieu de l’escroquerie était considérable. « Si je souhaitais investir dans l’escroquerie, ce serait le secteur le plus porteur de tous les temps », a-t-il assuré. Warren Buffet est loin d’être le seul individu à avoir alerté sur l’avènement de l’IA. Sundar Pichai de Google et Sam Altman d’OpenAI ont tous les deux comparé la technologie aux armes nucléaires, alors même que leurs entreprises comptent parmi les plus avancées dans le domaine. Geoffrey Hinton, spécialiste dans les réseaux de neurones artificiels, a pour sa part démissionné de chez Google après plus d’une décennie au sein de l’entreprise. Une démarche avec un but spécifique : alerter sur les dangers de l’IA, dont l’évolution s’accélère à une vitesse exponentielle. Malgré les nombreuses inquiétudes émises par des grands noms de la filière, le déploiement des outils d’IA générative s’intensifie… Même chez Berkshire Hathaway. La société a commencé à utiliser l’IA dans certaines de ses activités pour optimiser la productivité de ses employés, a fait savoir Greg Abel, successeur désigné de Buffett en tant que directeur général. Selon une étude du cabinet McKinsey, la technologie ajoutera 4 400 milliards de dollars de valeur à l’économie mondiale dans les prochaines années. Les gouvernements savent qu’ils doivent agir vite. L’Union européenne a ratifié sa législation pour réglementer l’IA, l’AI Act. Plus mesurés, les États-Unis ont tout de même mis en place un comité pour une IA sûre et sécurisée dans lequel siègent les leaders du secteur. De son côté, l’ONU a adopté une première résolution visant à développer une IA éthique et « digne de confiance ». Pour aller plus loin Pratique Ressources Abonnement 50 % sur notre abonnement annuel"

    "content": "Excluding Bitcoin, memecoins were the biggest narrative of this cycle. However, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tokens also performed remarkably during the first quarter of 2024. The crypto market recovered over the weekend from the May 1st retrace, with AI tokens showing significant gains. As a result, many industry experts think that the sector is poised for a ‘Round 2’ this cycle. Crypto analysts highlighted AI tokens alongside memecoins as the hottest topic of 2024, responsible for most of the massive gains during this cycle. According to CoinGecko’s report, AI was one of the three sectors that delivered three-digit returns in Q1. Moreover, the largest AI token by market capitalization, Fetch.ai (FET), saw gains of 378.3% during this period. As a result, some analysts deem the AI sector to be the next main narrative of the cycle. Trader John Walsh, known as CryptoGodJohn, considers “The future of AI coins preparing round 2.” Walsh added that the AI season is “extremely obvious” and will go “so much higher” based on the developments in the sectors, including Nvidia earnings, Apple AI, and Microsoft’s $100 billion AI fund. To this, crypto analyst MacroCRG replied that a massive AI growth “will be obvious in hindsight,” considering that the sector’s market capitalization is “just” $27.3 billion. AI mcap still just $27B It will be obvious in hindsight https://t.co/HH0Tb86fNY pic.twitter.com/71qgdwdM1C — CRG (@MacroCRG) May 6, 2024  According to a MacroCRG post, the AI market cap had increased 8% by Monday morning, and its daily trading volume was around $1.9 billion. On Tuesday, the market cap surged to $27.8 billion, a 2.3% increase from 24 hours ago. In comparison, memecoins $54.4 billion market cap doubles AI’s. However, its market cap decreased by 2.8% in the last day, with the top ten memecoins showing red numbers in the past 24 hours. Despite the remarkable performance, some figures think the sector has a more pessimistic future. According to memecoin trader Murad, the developments in the industry will “be replacing more & more jobs every year.” As a result, there will be an increase in “Anxieties and desperate attempts to ‘make it.’” To the trader, the industry will serve as a push for the memecoins sector, as “Growing AI capabilities will be one of the big forces accelerating the Memecoin Bubble.” Financial giant Warren Buffett shared a more skeptical view on Saturday. The Co-founder and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway revealed he is not sold yet by artificial intelligence. To the CEO: We let a genie out of the bottle when we developed nuclear weapons. AI is somewhat similar — it’s part way out of the bottle. Despite this, Buffet recognized the potential for AI technology to change the world positively. “The AI industry is on the brink of a multi-trillion-dollar boom,” stated Alex Wacy. The analyst believes the reasons behind this are the vast and diverse potential of applications. Moreover, the expert highlights that interest in the sector has steadily increased over the last year. A crypto and AI combination could potentially “create a market valued in the trillions.” According to the post, the market is projected to reach nearly $2 trillion by 2030, which suggests that the crypto industry should not overlook it. Tokens like RNDR showed a remarkable performance over the past week, with the price soaring by 45%. RNDR regained the $10 support zone this week after struggling to retest it over the last month. In the past 24 hours, the token’s price surged 6.4%, and its daily trading volume increased by 16.8%, with over $455 million being traded. FET is “a top performing AI coin headed into the Nvidia earnings,” as stated by John Walsh. The trader forecast that the token is “looking for a next leg higher up” after successfully retesting the $2.35 resistance level. $FET break retest now looking for next leg up higher  FET will be a top performing AI coin headed into the nvidia earnings pic.twitter.com/Agl0eqB9mD — Johnny (@CryptoGodJohn) May 6, 2024  FET broke above this level over the weekend, rising to $2.5 on Monday and remaining above the $2.40 support zone since. At writing time, the token is trading at $2.42, representing a 2.4% increase in the last 24 hours and a $22.9% surge in the past week.  \n\t\t\t\tRubmar is a writer and translator.

    "title": "Billionaire Investor Henry Kravis Pledges $100M to His Former Prep School",
    "description": "The donation is one of the largest ever given to an independent school.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-07T21:11:22Z",
    "content": "Private equity billionaire Henry Kravis is giving back to the preparatory school he attended in the 1960s, and the $100 million donation to the Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor, Connecticut, from Kravis and his wife Marie-Josée is the largest gift in the institution’s 150-year history. It is also one of the most significant ever made to an independent school. \n\t\t\t\t\tThank you for signing up!\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\tBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a rel=\"nofollow noreferer\" href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime.\t\t\t\t “I’m a strong believer in the positive impact a world-class education can have on a person, especially during the formative high school years,” said Kravis in a statement. “Loomis Chaffee taught me how to appreciate different perspectives, and it ultimately made me a lifelong student of the world.” SEE ALSO: Philanthropist Maria Manetti Shrem Gives UC Davis a Historic Arts Windfall  The gift from Kravis, the co-founder and co-executive chairman of investment firm KKR, and Marie-Josée, an economist, will go toward three different funds. Half of the total donation will benefit the Henry R. Kravis ’63 Opportunity Initiative Scholars Fund, which supports students with financial need and provides financing for school supplies. Another $20 million will be dispersed towards employee compensation via the Sheila A. Culbert Fund for Faculty and Staff Support, while an additional $30 million will benefit educational initiatives via the school’s Henry Kravis ’63 Fund for Institutional Priorities. “This amazing gift reflects their dedication to fostering a culture of academic distinction and supports our Founders’ original commitment to access and opportunity,” said Sheila Culbert, head of Loomis Chaffee, in a statement. Annual tuition at Loomis Chaffee, which currently has more than 700 students, ranges from $54,000 for day school and $70,000 for boarding school. Past major gifts to independent schools include a $128.5 million donation given to the George School in Newtown, Pennsylvania, by Barbara Dodd Anderson. The 2007 donation was enabled by a Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) investment made by Anderson’s father, who once taught the investing conglomerate’s chairman Warren Buffett while acting as a professor at Columbia Business School. The Webb Schools in Claremont, California received $100 million from an anonymous donor in 2021, while billionaire businessman Walter Annenberg gave $100 million to the Peddie School in Hightstown, New Jersey, in 1993. And in 2013, Deborah Simon—the daughter of Simon Property Group co-founder Melvin Simon—pledged the same amount to Pennsylvania’s Mercersburg Academy. Kravis, who has an estimated net worth of $11.7 billion, will also provide Loomis Chaffee with an additional $5 million annually over the next five years to support the Kravis Scholars Program, an initiative originally established in 1989 to enroll students from underrepresented backgrounds. The investor’s gifts to the school over the years have supported the building of a dormitory, established a center for excellence in teaching and helped create an economics instructorship in honor of Kravis’ favorite former economics teacher James “Grim” Wilson. The private equity pioneer has also been a generous patron of his alma mater Columbia Business School, from which he graduated in 1969. Kravis and Marie-Josée gave $100 million to the school in 2010—its largest-ever donation—to support its move to two new buildings. The couple’s other major donations also include two separate $100 million contributions to New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer in 2022 and 2014 to respectively fund a cancer research project and create a center for molecular oncology.

    "title": "Billionaire Cuts Investment in Nvidia, Says AI May Be Overhyped",

    "content": "The AI bubble isn't bursting just yet, but one insightful investor is suspicious it's overhyped. During an appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box, billionaire Stanely Druckenmiller — the founder of the Duquesne Family Office hedge fund — revealed that his firm had cut its investment in the AI chipmaker Nvidia earlier this year. As the financier explained, he'd decided to invest in Nvidia after one of his firm's young partners told him about Nvidia in 2022 and predicted that AI was going to be even bigger than the blockchain. \"I didn’t even know how to spell it, [but] I bought it,\" Druckenmiller said. \"Then a month later, ChatGPT happened. Even an old guy like me could figure out okay, what that meant, so I increased the position substantially.\" The rest is history. Last May, Business Insider reported that the Duquesne Family Office had spent a combined $430 million on Nvidia and Microsoft in its big AI bet — but by November, the firm had already begun trimming the fat. While he didn't go into specifics about this latest Nvidia load-lightening, the investor seemed to suggest that he saw the writing on the wall when the AI chip company's stock jumped up to $900 earlier in the year. \"We did cut that and a lot of other positions in late March,\" Druckenmiller said. \"We’ve had a hell of a run. A lot of what we recognized has become recognized by the marketplace now.\" Overall, the billionaire investor said that he simply needed a \"break\" from AI as it started to look a bit \"overhyped\" — even while saying that he remains \"bullish\" on the industry and that it might be \"underhyped\" in the long-term. \"As we go through all this capital spending, we need to do the payoff while it’s incrementally coming in by the day,\" Druckenmiller said. \"The big payoff might be four to five years from now.\" He went on to suggest that while other investors may have held onto their Nvidia shares to watch what happens — but Druckenmiller is not, as he said, the type to \"own things for 10 or 20 years.\" \"I'm not Warren Buffet,\" he joked. \"I wish I was Warren Buffet.\" And speaking of the Oracle of Omaha: the Berkshire Hathaway founder suggested over the weekend that AI is an incredible growth market, but a scary one at that. Buffett described during a shareholder call seeing a deepfake video of himself that was so convincing, it could have gotten him to \"send money to myself over and over in some crazy country.\" At the end of the day, though? The money men can make all the pronouncements they want, but what actually happens is anyone's guess.

    "title": "Berkshire Hathaway Q1 Earnings: A Detailed Analysis",
    "description": "Performance Surges Despite Market Challenges, Outstrips Analyst Expectations",
    "published_at": "2024-05-07T21:02:28Z",
    "content": "Net Earnings: Reported at $12,702 million, significantly below the previous year's $35,504 million, and exceeded the current quarterly estimate of $7,302 million. Earnings Per Share (Class A): Achieved $8,825, exceeding the estimated $6,155.28. Operating Earnings: Increased to $11,222 million from $8,065 million in the previous year. Insurance Underwriting: Grew to $2,598 million from $911 million year-over-year. Investment Gains/Losses: Reported a net gain of $1,480 million, influenced by $11.2 billion in realized gains on sales of investments. Share Repurchases: Approximately $2.6 billion was used to purchase shares of Class A and Class B common stock during the quarter. Insurance Float: Reported at approximately $168 billion as of March 31, 2024. Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.A) released its 8-K filing on May 4, 2024, detailing its financial performance for the first quarter of 2024. The conglomerate, known for its broad portfolio including insurance, utilities, railroad, and manufacturing operations, reported a significant shift in earnings influenced by both operational activities and investment gains. Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company led by CEO Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), operates across various sectors with its core business in insurance, conducted through subsidiaries like Geico and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. The firm leverages the cash flows from these operations to support other business ventures, including Burlington Northern Santa Fe (railroad) and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, alongside a host of manufacturing, service, and retail entities. The first quarter of 2024 saw Berkshire Hathaway achieving net earnings of $12,702 million, a stark contrast to the $35,504 million recorded in the same quarter the previous year. This year's earnings include $1,480 million from investment gains, significantly lower than the $27,439 million from the prior year, primarily due to a downturn in unrealized gains in equity security investments. The operating earnings stood at $11,222 million, up from $8,065 million in Q1 2023, indicating robust operational growth. The company's insurance operations showed remarkable improvement, with underwriting profits rising to $2,598 million from $911 million in the previous year. Investment income from insurance also saw an increase, contributing positively to the bottom line. Other segments, including the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, reported mixed results but continued to provide stable earnings contributions. Berkshire Hathaway's strategic financial maneuvers included the repurchase of $2.6 billion worth of Class A and Class B shares during the quarter, reflecting confidence in the intrinsic value of the company despite market fluctuations. The firms insurance float, a critical indicator of insurance leverage, stood at approximately $168 billion, underpinning its insurance operation's financial health. While the decrease in net earnings year-over-year primarily resulted from lower investment gains, the substantial increase in operating earnings highlights the company's operational strength and efficiency. The diverse portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway allows for a balanced risk management strategy, although it is subject to market volatilities, as seen in the investment segment. Overall, Berkshire Hathaway's first quarter performance in 2024 paints a picture of a conglomerate with strong operational health and savvy financial strategies, poised to continue its legacy of growth and profitability. Investors are encouraged to view the detailed financial statements and notes available on the Berkshire Hathaway website to gain deeper insights into the company's comprehensive financial health.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks in the S&P 500 and their past performance, and go directly to read 5 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.  It’s been a dynamic first quarter for the stock market. The S&P 500, one of the leading stock indexes in the world, gained 10.2% in the first three months of 2024, achieving its best first-quarter performance in five years. The impressive performance sparked greater interest among investors in the stock market. In March, investors poured roughly $50 billion into funds focused on purchasing stocks in the US, as reported by EPFR Global Data. That said, it is important to bear in mind that it is the bigger companies that are driving the market upward, especially those that are attentive to the ongoing artificial intelligence wave. The ‘Magnificent Seven’ accounted for 40% of the market’s overall gains in the first three months, according to data by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Meta’s remarkable returns of over 40% during the period were massively driven by the company’s announcement of its first-ever dividend earlier this year. Dividends play an important role in the investment landscape, with approximately 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 paying dividends to shareholders. However, consistently increasing payouts is a challenging feat. In fact, just 13% of the companies in the index are included in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, an elite group that tracks the performance of companies growing their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Investors also favor dividend growth stocks due to their strong performance over the years, particularly during periods of high interest rates. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we cited Abrdn’s data and reported that from December 2002 to December 2022, dividend growers and initiators delivered a compounded return of 10.68%, compared with a 2.70% return of dividend cutters and eliminators. We also mentioned that non-dividend payers also underperformed dividend growers during this period, returning 9.25%. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) are some of the best dividend stocks that have consistently raised their dividends over the years. The combination of dividend growth and high yields presents investors with strong investment opportunities. S&P 500 High Dividend Growth Index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their dividends for five consecutive years with an average dividend yield of 3%, has delivered an annualized return of 11.94% from 2010 to 2022, according to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices. The report also mentioned that during this period, the index grew its dividend at an annual average rate of 13.8%, exceeding the US long-term inflation rate. In this, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks in the S&P 500. Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from Pixabay Our Methodology: For this list, we scanned the list of the S&P 500 companies and picked dividend stocks with dividend yields above 2%, as of May 7. From that list, we picked 15 dividend stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds, as of Q4 2023. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). In addition to covering topics like the best S&P 500 dividend stocks to buy, at Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, artificial intelligence technology is on the cusp of earth-shattering breakthroughs, so we identified the cheapest AI stock that is trading at less than 5 times its market value excluding cash and investments with the potential to deliver 100x returns. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can.

    "published_at": "2024-05-07T17:34:13Z",
    "content": "Plus: Mixed Messages On Apple From The Oracle Of Omaha, And What Boeing’s Union Firefighter Lockout Signals About Its Future Labor Strategy Optimism is still strong on Wall Street. Following a string of economic news that wasn’t necessarily great last week, markets still climbed steadily upward. It started last Wednesday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced that inflation was still too high, and interest rates would not be cut. The decision was no surprise, considering inflation has been stickier than many hoped all year. But Powell’s press conference announcing the lack of movement significantly rallied the markets, because he also said it is “unlikely” the Fed will raise interest rates further. Markets rallied again on Friday, after the Labor Department showed job growth cooled in April. Just 175,000 jobs were added last month, far short of consensus estimates of 240,000. While fewer new jobs isn’t good economic news, it seems to show labor demand is slowing, which in turn could make inflationary pressures ease up. And then on Monday, news came that Hamas had accepted a cease-fire agreement that could step down the intensity of the Israel-Gaza war. Markets swung upwards and stayed there, even as Israel ignored the potential agreement and vowed to press on with its offensive, attacking the Gazan city of Rafah. Forbes’ Mitchell Martin delves into the apparent exceptionalism of the U.S. economy. While other countries have seen recessions, supply chain problems and falling markets, Martin writes the U.S.’s limited reliance on international trade, policies encouraging reinvestment and government spending have made it the “cleanest dirty shirt” on the economic scene. Markets continue to grow, despite pervasive inflation, high interest rates and geopolitical conflicts. And optimism will likely continue to rule. The last several years have not been easy for startups, especially as investors have been less generous with capital. Jason Godley, currently CFO at Xactly, has served in the same position at other small companies as they’ve worked to scale. I talked to him about his experience and how he’s worked with companies’ important stakeholders: the CEO, investors and board. An excerpt from the interview is later in this newsletter. An Apple Store in New York City. Following discouraging news about sales and demand, and declining stock for much of the year, many were expecting the worst in Apple’s most recent earnings report. But that’s not what the tech company delivered. Earnings were solidly above expectations—even though total sales were 4% lower than the year-ago period, and 7% lower than this time of the year in 2022. Much of the declining demand came from China—as analysts expected—but CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call that the long-view for China is still positive. Apple’s stocks rallied following the earnings report and have stayed more than 4% higher, though part of that could be based on a couple of moves Cook used to flip the script. Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback, and Cook alluded to big new developments using generative AI coming later this year. With all of that promise, it seems a bit odd that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold off about 13% of its holdings in the company. However, Buffett suggested at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting over the weekend that selling the stock now could help the firm pay larger taxes, as he believes a federal tax hike may be imminent. Buffett said it’s still “extremely likely” Apple will still be Berkshire’s largest investment at the end of the year. Forbes senior contributor Peter Cohan writes it’s hard to tell exactly what Buffett is thinking, though this could be a chance for Berkshire to make more money by selling off a larger portion of his $135.4 billion stake. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images At-home exercise company Peloton was a perfect fit for the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, when gyms nationwide closed their doors and people craved both exercise and interaction. It’s been a harder road in the more recent past, as the company has seen its revenues steadily drop amid an oversupply of equipment, several recalls and people wanting to get back into the world to exercise. Last week, Peloton reported a quarterly net loss of $167.3 million—and layoffs of about 400 employees, as well as former CEO Barry McCarthy stepping down. The cuts impact about 15% of Peloton’s employees, and are seen as a way for the company to reduce annual spending by more than $200 million by the end of the 2025 fiscal year. An internal memo indicated Peloton’s layoffs took place because the company “simply had no other way to bring its spending in line with its revenue.” Boeing also has seen no end to its recent problems, and just added a new one: It locked out its unionized on-site firefighters at its manufacturing plants in Washington. Forbes senior contributor Marisa Garcia writes Boeing had insisted on increasing the time it took for a firefighter to reach maximum pay to 19 years. It had been 14 years in the previous contract. With its private firefighters locked out, Boeing is using public agencies for primary response now. In a statement, the International Association of Firefighters union said the lockout is intended to “punish, intimidate and coerce its firefighters into accepting a contract that undervalues their work.” The firefighters union has just 125 members, but this isn’t a good indicator for Boeing’s future. It’s currently in its first negotiations in 16 years with the 32,000-member International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union in Puget Sound, Washington and Portland, Oregon. A Viking Cruises ship docked in Shanghai, China. Luxury cruise ship operator Viking Holdings is sailing toward a bigger share of the multibillion dollar industry following its IPO last week. The company’s shares debuted at $24, and quickly rose, steadily climbing to more than $28 per share. Viking’s $1.5 billion IPO is the biggest so far this year. It offers ocean, river and expedition-style cruises geared toward adults with high income, and makes an average of $7,251 in revenue per passenger. The company’s prospects are enhanced by a booming travel market and its unique offerings. Xactly CFO Jason Godley. Jason Godley has been in CFO positions at venture-backed startup companies for almost a decade. He’s currently in this role at SaaS provider Xactly, where he started in early 2023. Through the years, he’s learned a lot about how to balance priorities and really listen to everyone, working with CEOs and founders to ensure that they are getting the cash they need to grow a business, but ensuring the company can go on. A portion of our conversation is included here. This has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. You’ve said it’s important to always come back to the strategy. How much strategy do you generally set as the CFO? Are you talking to the board and the CEO about where they see the company going and their priorities? Or are you looking at the numbers and saying what priorities should be based on the finances?  Godley: I do have this bit of a funny saying: When you’re doing your job, people are generally kind of dissatisfied. Your investors would love for you to be at the perfectly optimized business model. The CEO wants everything to be up and to the right. I want the same thing. At the same time, we have to be super thoughtful around what we can and cannot do. I think the CFO needs to be able to understand holistically all of the art of the possible. We see a lot of stuff. We understand ROIs, either at the business level or in the function level. How do you articulate the trade-offs within the business of what you can and can’t do to make sure that CEO and investors really understand the trade-offs? It’s not saying, ‘No, we can’t do something.’ It’s like, ‘Look, I get it. Here’s how we should think about the pros and cons of that decision that we may be able to drive for gross margin improvement today.’ Or maybe we need to invest in something today that holds down our profitability, but that’s going to improve long-term terminal value. I think you have to be very comfortable—kind-of be Switzerland, if you will—in balancing all these things, because they do want to hear our perspective as the CFO because we do have a pretty good pulse on the things that can work or not work. You’ve said that communication is key for the CFO to harmonize with all stakeholders and to minimize conflict from disagreements. Financial professionals haven’t always honed their communication skills. How would you recommend CFOs and those who aspire to the position improve this skill? I would say it starts with awareness. I’m a big student of ethical mindfulness. There’s some data that says [47%] of the time, we are not even paying attention—like we’re lost in lots of thoughts. So step one is being mindful of the fact that maybe my communication style may or may not be working. Because if you don’t even know it, it’s very difficult [to make a change]. I think then you have to get comfortable that you want to change it, because behavior change is difficult unless you actually recognize that you want to change. It is probably being very honest in getting feedback from everybody around you. How am I showing up as a leader, getting a 360 review? Maybe you get angry and just rub people the wrong way. I have learned I can be overly nuanced in my communication style sometimes to blunt the pain of the conversation, which sometimes doesn’t work. But I’ve learned that through asking for feedback. It’s asking for feedback, and then literally being very explicit on the two or three things that you can do to try and institute change. And then with time, they become more habit and evolve over time. With habit change, there’s this notion of you want to feel like you’re getting better. I think when your communication starts to improve, the receptivity of the people who you’re talking to actually will improve. For a CFO who is trying to deal with all of the competing pressures, what would you tell them to do? And what would you tell them to absolutely never do? Nothing is black and white. I’m going to come back to a quote that is what to do, which is a zen quote: In the beginner’s mind, there are many possibilities. In the expert’s mind, there are few. As a CFO, you are both expert in some ways, but also should have a beginner’s mind. In all of the things that are happening, having this framing of [finding out] how [other stakeholders] are thinking about stuff, for me personally, works. It could also work for others in the same situation.

    "content": "  Home » Investing The Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) annual meeting is always a major event for investors, as it gives shareholders a chance to hear from the man himself, Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett. However, this year’s annual meeting, held Saturday in Omaha, was indeed bittersweet as it was the first without Buffett’s long-time partner, Charlie Munger, who died on November 28 at the age of 99. Buffett offered a tribute to his friend and partner in his annual letter to shareholders, calling him the “architect of Berkshire Hathaway.” If Berkshire Hathaway is the house that Buffett built, Munger was the architect who drew up the plans. Munger told Buffett in 1965 — before he joined the company — that Buffett had made a “dumb decision” in buying control of Berkshire Hathaway. However, since it was a done deal, Munger said he would tell him how to fix the mistake. “Nevertheless, Charlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: ‘Warren, forget about ever buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add to it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses at wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero, Ben Graham. It works, but only when practiced at small scale.’ With much back-sliding I subsequently followed his instructions,” Buffett wrote in the letter. More than a decade later, Munger joined his old friend at Berkshire Hathaway, and the two had been running the company until Munger died last year. “In reality, Charlie was the ‘architect’ of the present Berkshire, and I acted as the ‘general contractor’ to carry out the day-by-day construction of his vision. Charlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me take the bows and receive the accolades. In a way his relationship with me was part older brother, part loving father. Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the reins, and when I blundered, he never — never — reminded me of my mistake,” Buffett wrote. He added that Munger’s legacy as architect should live on.  “In the physical world, great buildings are linked to their architect while those who had poured the concrete or installed the windows are soon forgotten. Berkshire has become a great company. Though I have long been in charge of the construction crew, Charlie should forever be credited with being the architect,” Buffett concluded. Also in the letter, Buffett discussed the next generation of leadership, vice chairs Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, and their ties to Omaha. “Greg Abel, who runs all non-insurance operations for Berkshire — and in all respects is ready to be CEO of Berkshire tomorrow — was born and raised in Canada (he still plays hockey). In the 1990s, however, Greg lived for six years in Omaha just a few blocks away from me. During that period, I never met him. A decade or so earlier, Ajit Jain, who was born, raised and educated in India, lived with his family in Omaha only a mile or so from my home (where I’ve lived since 1958),” he wrote. All three men sat on the stage on Saturday, answering questions from shareholders. One of the shareholders asked who will have final say over the stock portfolio. Buffett said it would be Abel. “He understands businesses,” Buffett said, reported Yahoo. “The responsibilities should entirely be with Greg.”  Last year, the portfolio returned 15.8%, trailing the S&P 500ʻs return of 26.3%, but as Buffett said, Berkshire Hathaway was built and designed for the long run. “I believe Berkshire can handle financial disasters of a magnitude beyond any heretofore experienced. This ability is one we will not relinquish. When economic upsets occur, as they will, Berkshire’s goal will be to function as an asset to the country — just as it was in a very minor way in 2008-09 — and to help extinguish the financial fire rather than to be among the many companies that, inadvertently or otherwise, ignited the conflagration,” he wrote. Since 1965, its portfolio has performed nearly twice as well as the S&P 500, with an average annual return of 19.8%, compared to 10.2% for the S&P 500.  Never Miss A Story!

    "description": "Apple's event is looking to give the iPad a boost.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-07T14:13:47Z",
    "content": "       Hello! This Sunday is Mother's Day, which I'm sure you already know. But just in case it slipped your mind, here are some last-minute gift ideas. In today's big story, we're looking at the new tech Apple's set to unveil at its event. What's on deck: Markets: Blackstone's high-profile real-estate fund could be in trouble. Tech: ChatGPT who? Microsoft is reportedly building its own AI model. Business: Meet nuclear power's newest fans: data centers. But first, Apple is showing off some new toys. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Apple's unveiling new products today, but they're not the ones you might be thinking of. The tech giant's event will reportedly showcase a new family of… iPads and iPad accessories. The crowd goes mild! You're forgiven if you weren't aware iPads were still a thing, let alone getting updated. Apple's tablet didn't upend industries like the iPod or iPhone. But Apple's event, which kicks off at 10 a.m. EST, is looking to give the iPad a boost. Business Insider's Antonio Villas-Boas has a rundown of what to expect. The tablet's main issue has been its existence in a no-man's land. Less powerful than a computer but not much better than a mobile phone, the iPad has a limited set of specific use cases. The new iPads will reportedly feature better displays, a thinner design, and a MacBook processor. (Personally, my iPad primarily serves as a second TV when my wife gets sick of me watching sports in the living room.) The update comes not a moment too soon for Apple. iPhone sales have noticeably dipped, which is why you're hearing Apple tout its \"services\" business, writes BI's Peter Kafka. But even that's a bit of a misnomer. A good chunk of that growing \"services\" business is the billions of dollars it receives from Google for giving the search engine prime real estate, Peter writes. And the new product Apple wants you to be excited about — the Vision Pro — hasn't lived up to the hype. One of the biggest issues, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos, is that it's unclear what the headset should be used for. It's not all bad news. Apple reported strong earnings last week, and, more importantly, pulled Wall Street's favorite lever: buybacks. Apple still has some exciting things in the pipeline. AI, naturally, is a big one. All eyes are on how the tech will be integrated into the iPhone. Apple has remained tight-lipped, with CEO Tim Cook only teasing a big AI announcement in the \"coming weeks.\" I decided to ask Katie what she'd like to see out of the Apple event today: \"New iPads aren't really too exciting unless you're already planning to buy a new iPad. (I'm not planning on it, and if I was, I'd probably get an iPad Mini, which isn't expected to get an update at this event.) But I am curious to see if the new iPad Pros will have the latest M4 chip, which isn't even in MacBooks and Macs yet. If it is, we'll get a peek at what it's capable of when it comes to regular computers later on. I'm also looking forward to watching the livestream, because even if the Apple Pencil is kind of boring (to me), these Apple events are always fascinating: a huge marketing spectacle that always has some subtle clues about how Apple wants to position itself.\" Blackstone's $114 billion real-estate fund has veteran analysts worried. The private-equity giant found success pitching ordinary investors on BREIT, a commercial real-estate fund. But some veteran analysts, accountants, and investors believe Blackstone's estimates of BREIT's assets are wildly inflated, making it essentially a house of cards. You thought your interest payments were bad… The US government is shelling out $2 million a minute for interest payments on its debt. The first three months of the year saw the US Treasury foot a $234 billion bill in interest expenses. Recession watch. Official data from the National Bureau of Economic Research shows a promising trend — that economic slumps are becoming less common. But some analysts, including veteran forecaster Danielle DiMartino Booth, are warning that the recession might already be here as job cuts accelerate. Jack Dorsey's in his \"I love Elon\" era. Dorsey has loved and hated Elon Musk over the years. Now it looks like he's fawning over the Tesla CEO. Most recently, Dorsey announced he was no longer on the board of Bluesky, a prominent rival of Musk's X. Satya Nadella could prove Microsoft doesn't need OpenAI. The company is reportedly working on its own in-house AI model called MAI-1. Its successful development could prove Microsoft doesn't need ChatGPT maker OpenAI to get ahead in the AI wars. Tech titans have weird management habits. From Jeff Bezos' \"two-pizza rule\" to Mark Zuckerberg wearing the same outfit every day, here's a round-up of the unconventional practices employed by some of the world's best-known CEOs. Nuclear power + data centers = \"perfect marriage.\" Data-center operators like Amazon have sought out nuclear power to fuel soaring growth. Nuclear execs see it as a boon, but energy experts worry about the implications for the power grid. How much Warren Buffett lost on Paramount. The Berkshire Hathaway investor says he lost \"quite a bit of money\" betting on the media company. He didn't disclose how much money he lost, but we tried doing the math. It could be around $1.5 billion. a16z joins the Big Tech \"fake work\" debate. In an interview published Monday with Emily Sundberg for her Substack newsletter \"Feed Me,\" Andreessen Horowitz general partner David Ulevitch called Google \"an amazing example\" of a corporation employing people in \"BS jobs.\" Around half the tech giant's white-collar staff probably do \"no real work,\" he added. Columbia University just canceled its commencement. Trump hit with 10th gag violation and warning: next time, jail. Howard Schultz tells Starbucks to fix its stores and mobile app to reverse 'fall from grace.' A financial analyst who quit to study tai chi shares the simple morning exercise she uses to prevent burnout. Tesla sends out another wave of layoff notices as employees enter 4th week of job cuts. Condé Nast has reached a deal with its union, and some call it bittersweet. Fisker is closing its Manhattan Beach headquarters, employees say. All the looks celebrities wore to the 2024 Met Gala. Today's earnings: The Walt Disney Company, Reddit, and other companies are reporting. Russian President Vladimir Putin will be inaugurated today after winning elections in March.

    "title": "Elon Musk Invites Warren Buffett To Invest In Tesla As Sales Fall",
    "description": "This comes as Tesla's electric vehicle sales are declining globally and it is dealing with difficult times.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-07T14:03:57Z",
    "content": "Tesla has been under pressure from dropping sales. Elon Musk on Monday invited well-known billionaire investor Warren Buffett to think about investing in Tesla. This comes as Tesla's electric vehicle sales are declining globally and it is dealing with difficult times. In response to an X user who recommended that the Berkshire Hathaway owner sell his Apple shares and move his money to Tesla, the X and SpaceX owner stated that this would be \"obvious\" for the seasoned investor. A user said on May 6, \"C'mon Warren Buffett, sell all your $AAPL and buy $TSLA.\" To this, Mr Musk said, \"He should take a position in Tesla. It's an obvious move.\" Notably, Berkshire Hathaway has a stake in Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD but not in Tesla. He should take a position in Tesla. It's an obvious move. Meanwhile, Mr Buffett's Berkshire sold off a large number of Apple shares as the company stake fell 22 per cent to $135.4 billion. At the end of the first quarter, Apple remained by far Berkshire's largest holding. In a clarification, Mr Buffett stated that he was cutting his investment in Apple because of tax implications after making significant profits, not because he was changing his long-term outlook for the firm. \"It doesn't bother me in the least to write that check - and I would really hope with all that America's done for all of you, it shouldn't bother you that we do it -and if I'm doing it at 21% this year and we're doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year,\" he added.  PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Elon Musk's Tesla has laid off staff from the software, service and engineering departments, as per a report in Reuters. The move comes after the automaker disbanded its EV charging department following Tesla's announcement last month that it was reducing its global workforce by more than 10 per cent. Tesla has been under pressure from dropping sales and an intensifying price war among automakers as elevated interest rates have slowed the adoption of electric vehicles. The company is looking to focus on autonomous driving software, robotaxis and its humanoid robot Optimus, and Musk could be cutting its spending on certain teams to preserve cash for those projects, analysts have said.

    "description": "Auf der Hauptversammlung seines Unternehmens Berkshire Hathaway gab Starinvestor Warren Buffett Einblicke in die Kunst des erfolgreichen Investierens und erinnerte an seine kürzlich verstorbene rechte Hand Charlie Munger. Wer sein Geld selbst klug anlegen wil…",
    "published_at": "2024-05-07T13:38:17Z",
    "content": "FOCUS online war dabei, als Star-Investor Warren Buffett auf der Hauptversammlung seines Unternehmens Berkshire Hathaway Einblicke in seine Anlagestrategie gab. Aus diesen kann jeder fünf fundamentale Dinge über Geld und das Leben lernen. An einem Wochenende im Mai pilgern Zehntausende Menschen aus aller Welt in die unbemerkenswerte Stadt Mittelamerikas, um sich von einem alten weißen Mann, den sie wie einen Guru verehren, erklären zu lassen, warum sie ihn nicht wie einen Guru verehren sollten. Während sie Plüschtiere mit dem Abbild dieses Gurus kaufen, diskutieren sie Wege zu möglichst rationalem Verhalten. Nachdem sie Aktientipps tauschen, nicken sie, wenn dieser Guru Nettigkeit als viel wichtiger als Geld preist. Zwischendurch fotografieren sie die Einrichtung eines McDonald’s, der aussieht wie alle McDonald’s, weil ihr Guru dort gerne frühstückt. An einem Wochenende im Mai tun Zehntausende in Omaha, Nebraska, Dinge, für die man sie als Sektenanhänger abstempeln könnte. Wer genauer hinsieht, erkennt jedoch Menschen, die nach demselben suchen, wie wir alle. Im Gegensatz zu Sektenanhängern finden es viele, zumindest ein wenig. Mehr zum Thema: Der Bericht zur Berkshire-Hathaway-Hauptversammlung 2023  Der wohlmeinende Guru, zu dem an diesem Wochenende Zehntausende pilgern, heißt Warren Buffett. Der 93-Jährige hat das achtgrößte Unternehmen der Welt aufgebaut, zählt zu den reichsten Menschen der Erde. Weil er trotzdem im gleichen Haus wohnt wie seit fast 70 Jahren, weil er nach seinem Tod 99,9 Prozent seines Vermögens spendet und weil er in der Finanzkrise 2008 die US-Wirtschaft rettete, versuchen schwerreiche Fondsmanager, arme Studenten und durchschnittliche Rentner, so bodenständig zu werden wie der Multimilliardär. Der harte Kern trifft sich einmal im Jahr in Omaha. „Meine Frau hat mir das Wochenende zum 40. Geburtstag geschenkt“, sagt ein Frankfurter. „Ich bin leidenschaftlicher Investor.“ Offiziell lädt an diesem Wochenende Buffetts Firma Berkshire Hathaway zur Hauptversammlung. Obwohl den Konzern in Deutschland wenige kennen, übersteigt sein Börsenwert den von Coca-Cola , Disney, WKN 855686\">Disney und Toyota zusammen. Zur Hauptversammlung berichtet das Management über Umsätze und Gewinne. Aktionäre diskutieren Anträge. Eine dröge Sache. Doch deswegen ist kaum jemand hier. Zur eigentlichen, aufs rechtliche Minimum gekürzten, Hauptversammlung sitzt Buffett am Samstagnachmittag vor einer fast leeren Halle. Die meisten Gäste genießen lieber das umfangreiche Rahmenprogramm. Viele picknicken 20 Autominuten weiter westlich. Berkshire-Anleger halten ihre Papiere meist genauso wenig wegen deren Kurspotenzial wie Musikfans Taylor Swift und Bruce Springsteen wegen ihrer Akkordfolgen verehren: Ihnen geht es um das Gefühl hinter dem Offensichtlichen; um Werte, Hoffnungen und Lehren. Über diese spricht Buffett vor allem in der Fragerunde vor der Hauptversammlung. Am Samstag, ab 8.45 Uhr, sitzt er dafür vor einer vollgepackten Halle. An sechs Mikrofonen fragen ihn Ausgeloste – unter ihnen auffällig viele Deutsche –, was sie wollen: „Sehen Sie Anlagechancen in Kanada?“ „Welchen Rat sollte jeder kennen?“ „Warum haben Sie Apple-Aktien verkauft?“ „Wie wichtig sind Vorbilder? Und danke, dass Sie so ein tolles Vorbild sind.“ Buffett antwortet, als antworte er seinen Kindern : „Überlege, wie du auf dein Leben zurückblicken willst. Dann lebe so, dass du das eines Tages tun kannst.“ „Die wichtigsten Lektionen beim Investieren lauten: Kaufe eine Aktie so sorgfältig, als würdest du das ganze Unternehmen kaufen, und sehe den Markt als deinen Diener.“ Die Buffett-Manie kann man kultähnlich finden. In einer Welt, in der viele Menschen der Finanzindustrie Gier und Kurzsichtigkeit vorwerfen, liefert ein auch von Jugendlichen verehrter Senior, dessen Fans stolz erzählen, wie lange sie Aktien halten und wie sie aus ethischen Gründen auf Gewinne verzichten, aber einen Gegenentwurf – vor allem, weil er damit erfolgreicher ist als alle anderen. „Am liebsten halten wir Aktien für immer“, betont Buffett auch dieses Mal. Das Frankfurter Pärchen nickt. Lange bevor die Fragerunde beginnt, lange bevor die Moderatorin Apple-Chef Tim Cook und Microsoft -Gründer Bill Gates im Saal begrüßt, und lange bevor das Berkshire-Treffen seine Pforten öffnet, bildet sich unter dem Gewitter-Nachthimmel Omahas eine Menschenschlange vor den Türen der Kongresshalle. Der harte Kern des harten Kerns harrt für die besten Plätze unter Schauern und Blitzen aus. Ein Fondsmanager aus Kalifornien rennt ab drei Uhr morgens in Dauerschleife zu Starbucks und zurück, um die Wartenden mit Kaffee und Muffins zu versorgen. Er hat gut einem Dutzend Studenten aus Los Angeles die Reise nach Omaha finanziert. „Fragt die Jungs neben euch, ob sie einen Snack wollen“, sagt er zu einigen von ihnen. „Seid ihr sicher, dass ich nicht noch einmal los soll?“ Ähnlich hilfsbereit kümmern sich die meisten Gäste umeinander. „Wenn Sie nicht reich sind, seien Sie nett“, sagt Buffett später. „Dann tragen Sie mehr zur Welt bei als die meisten reichen Menschen. Und wenn Sie zu den finanziell Glücklichen gehören: Machen Sie auch andere glücklich.“ Ähnliches sagen viele. Doch niemand sonst von ihnen hat in einem skandalfreien Leben Hunderte Milliarden für wohltätige Zwecke gesammelt. Deswegen prägen Buffetts Worte Leben. Ihn fasziniere an Buffett, dass er vor allem ein gutes Leben führen wolle, sagt ein schwedischer Student. Alles andere bleibt Werkzeug zu diesem Ziel. Lebensphilosophie zuerst, dann Wirtschaftslehre, Psychologie und Milliardenvermögen in ihrem Dienst. Wer dem nacheifert, finde in Omaha etwas, das sonst wenige teilen. Buffett eröffnet die Fragerunde, wie jedes Jahr, mit einem Kurzfilm. Sonst 15 Minuten Selbstironie mit Hilfe von Hollywoodstars, erinnert die diesjährige Ausgabe an Buffetts Ende 2023 verstorbenen Partner Charlie Munger , den zweiten Guru Berkshires. „Als wir uns trafen, dachten unsere Frauen: Oh Gott, noch einer?“, sagte Buffett einst. Nun gesteht er, neue Anlageideen seit Mungers Tod oft mit sich selbst besprechen zu müssen. Mungers Tod prägt das Treffen. Von 1978 bis 2023 laufen Berkshire-Hauptversammlungen nach dem gleichen Muster: Buffett beschreibt kluge Ideen und fragt: „Charlie, willst du was hinzufügen?“ Munger fasst die Ideen in zwei, drei Sätzen humorvoll zusammen: „Natürlich gibt es viel Wichtigeres im Leben als Reichtum. Aber die Leute vergessen es. Ein Golfpartner sagte einmal zu mir: ‚Was bringt mir Gesundheit, wenn ich mir davon kein Geld kaufen kann?‘“ Der Saal brüllt. Oder: „Ich bin Optimist. Und ich stehe mit einem Bein im Grab. Dann werdet ihr doch wohl ein bisschen Inflation aushalten.“ Munger habe alle Techniken gelernt, mit denen Menschen andere betrügen, aber nur, um sich und andere davor zu schützen, sagt Buffett dieses Mal. „Wer so denkt, ist ein besonderer Mensch.“ Dieser Mensch fehlt dem Treffen. Ohne Mungers Zweizeiler bleiben Buffetts Ausführungen etwas schwunglos. Manchmal verliert er die Aufmerksamkeit der Halle ein wenig. „Ohne Charlie komme ich nächstes Jahr nicht mehr“, sagt eine Frau in der Mittagspause zu ihrem Mann. Unfreiwillig bestätigt Buffett damit, was er auf die vielen Fragen zu Munger antwortet: Niemand ist allein gut. Wer vertrauenswürdige Partner findet, solle sie um jeden Preis in seinem Leben halten: „Charlie war der geniale Architekt hinter Berkshire Hathaway. Ich war so etwas wie der Generalunternehmer. Oder der Dachdecker.“ Beide brauchten ihren Partner. Wie Partner behandelt Buffett auch seine Aktien: Wer eine Aktie kauft, kaufe kein Papier. Er kaufe einen Teil eines Unternehmens. Dabei müsse er die gleiche Frage stellen wie bei der Partnerwahl in Leben und Beruf: Welche Werte sind mir wichtig, wenn ich mich langfristig binde? Wie entwickle ich mich zu einem Menschen, an den sich andere binden wollen? Diese Herangehensweise erklärt fast alles an Buffett und Berkshire. Der Preis, den Buffett und Munger für ihre Wertetreue zahlen und für den sie heute verehrt werden, ist schreiende Uncoolness. Langweilige Aktien statt Trendstocks, ein Büro in Omaha statt an der Wall Street, Durchschnittsautos statt Sportwagen. Die jahrzehntealte Bühnendeko der Hauptversammlung könnte von Buffets Highschool-Abschluss stammen. Er und Munger wirken wie der Gegenentwurf zu Menschen, die sich um Ausstrahlung und Vermächtnis sorgen. „Die Schaut-mich-an-Leute gehen lieber woanders hin“, antwortet Buffett auf eine Nachfrage nach seinem Nachfolger. „Deswegen können Sie sicher sein: Wir haben gute Leute.“ Die Zuschauer finden Buffet und Munger cool, weil sie gerne uncool sind. Nur weil sie ihr Handeln nach inneren Werten statt äußeren Erwartungen richten, investierten sie erfolgreicher als jeder andere. Davon können Anleger lernen: Derzeit meiden viele Investoren Aktien des taiwanesischen Chipgiganten TSMC aus Angst vor einer chinesischen Invasion. Viele kaufen stattdessen Papiere des US-Chipriesen und Trendstocks Nvidia . Nvidia lässt seine Chips aber bei TSMC fertigen. Wer sich um TSMC sorgt, sollte sich auch um Nvidia sorgen. Statt aus Versäumnisspanik Hypes nachzulaufen, profitieren auch Privatanleger von eigenständigem Denken. Diese Eindrücke erklären zusammengenommen, warum Zehntausende jedes Jahr nach Omaha pilgern. Die wenigsten von ihnen erhoffen sich Tipps zu schnellem Reichtum und teuren Autos. Wenn sie es tun, sind sie fehl am Platz. Munger sagte einst, er habe nie einen Ferrari gewollt, sondern die Freiheit, die Geld bringt. Vielleicht flog er deswegen auch noch mit über 90 Jahren dritte Klasse. Die meisten Menschen fliegen aus allen Ländern nach Omaha, weil sie in einer Welt leben wollen, in der ethisches Handeln zu Erfolg führt. In einer Welt, in der zwei bodenständige Normalos Geld besser anlegen als zugekokste Ehrgeizlinge, eben weil sie bodenständige Normalos sind. Munger und Buffett lassen sie daran glauben. Paradoxerweise finden diese Menschen den Weg zu erfolgreichen Geldanlagen, weil sie ihn nicht suchen: Zuerst an Werte denken, dann langfristig in Unternehmen investieren, die diesen Werten dienen. Der Rest kommt von selbst. Börsenerfolg entsteht als Abfallprodukt eines guten Lebens. Wer Ersteres anstrebt, lernt automatisch auch das Zweite. Darum geht es bei Berkshire. Auf dem Weg, das ist die dritte Botschaft, lohnt es sich, Spaß zu haben. Deswegen kaufen die Berkshire-Aktionäre Buffett-Plüschies, Munger-Wackelköpfe und vielen anderen typisch-amerikanischen Unsinn. Dass es sich dabei nicht um eine Sekte handelt, verraten Selbstironie und günstige Preise. Ob Spaßartikel zum Börsenerfolg verhelfen? Fragen Sie mich in einem Jahr. Ich habe das Munger-Plüschie auch gekauft.

That's in keeping with his long-time philosophy of steering clear of technology that is beyond his grasp. His massive stake in Apple, for example, his largest stock holding even if it's been reduced, came about more as an epiphany related to its consumer success than as a technology bet, he said over the weekend at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. But at the closely watched event in Omaha this year, the billionaire investor and Berkshire CEO and chairman couldn't avoid AI as a topic on the minds of shareholders. Buffett fielded several questions about artificial intelligence. Calling AI profound, Buffet said that the technology is like a \"genie\" — once it gets let out of the bottle, it could have disastrous effects. The worst fears he sees — massive scamming ability enabled by AI to the threat of a breakthrough science equivalent to nuclear weapons in unintended consequences and risk to humanity. And there is at least one question, Buffett said, that no one can answer when it comes to AI's impact on the world which may change the lives of every individual on a daily basis. It's a question, he said, that has riddled the best economists for a century. \"It can create an enormous amount of leisure time,\" Buffett said. \"Now what the world does with leisure time is another question. ... I know an awful lot of people think when they go to work at first what they want is leisure time – and what I like is actually having more problems to solve,\" said Buffett, who is famous for having said he has \"tap danced\" to work in his Omaha office for decades. Buffett pointed to the example of John Maynard Keynes, one of the most important economic thinkers of the modern era, who correctly predicted output per capita would grow at an exponential rate, but failed to predict what humans would do with increased productivity. Keynes is generally regarded as the father of macroeconomics, known best for his support of government intervention through social and job programs in order to stabilize economics during economic downturns including the Great Depression, and books including \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money,\" which Buffett recommended adding to a reading list. Productivity has been booming over the past several quarters. According to BLS data, after a massive productivity spike during Covid, there was a protracted slump, and it's only over the past four quarters that the data has turned around, up roughly 3% year over year. This rebound has led to questions from corporate executives about factors that could be at play, from AI to return-to-office mandates. But most say that it's still too early in the technology's implementation to make any connection, drawing a distinction between AI that has been deployed for years already and where gains can be tracked, versus the generative AI that everyone is talking about today, and that will take some time to show up in the data.  Economic researchers also caution against reading too much into any short-term productivity boost, as quarterly government data is often subject to significant revision and it can takes years to be able to identify a major change in the productivity trend line. AI will ultimately be a major labor productivity driver, even if it's not there yet. IBM vice chair and former head of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn said on CNBC last week that AI adoption is quickly happening, and the productivity gains are also happening, albeit slowly. \"Every company is looking at AI and deciding where it will help them,\" he said during a recent interview on CNBC's \"Money Movers.\"   \"This is an evolution; we are going to evolve into this in the productivity game, and it is going to feed through the economy slowly,\" Cohn said. But he added, \"I don't think we've seen the real productivity boost from AI.\"   Most companies are still in the stage of setting budgets for AI and overarching strategy for how it can help both customers and employees, and trying to get into implementation mode. MongoDB CEO Dev Ittycheria, whose company released a suite of tools last week to help companies \"overwhelmed by AI,\" recently told CNBC that executives have reached the point of asking when the AI value and return will accrue to them. The market is passing through the phase of the value accruing only at the bottom layer, such as Nvidia and ChatGPT/OpenAI, and it is now critical for companies to prepare for the applications built on top of that infrastructure.  \"Clearly, there is a trend where we go to 'agentic' workflows, agents take actions on behalf of the end user autonomously. It's a little ways out, but people do need to build apps and enrich customer experience and drive more cost out of the business and find new ways to drive growth.\"  Productivity booms are rare and tend to be once-in-a-generation events — the last was in the mid to late 1990s leading up to the dotcom crash — a period of significant economic growth notably not driven by creation of new jobs. The problem of technological advances decreasing the amount of available jobs is an ongoing concern, and there have been countless surveys published since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 covering job losses, or in the jargon often used to reflect the uncertainty over exact impact, jobs with \"AI exposure.\" Companies like to say that AI won't replace jobs, but will allow human workers to focus on higher-value skills and tasks while giving over to the machines the rote work that humans don't like to do anyway. But about 37% of business leaders surveyed by Resume Builder said technology replaced workers in 2023, with 44% saying more layoffs would happen this year due to advancements in AI. However, historically technological advancements — such as the increase of industrialization — haven't proven to be the career killers that experts warn about. Due to the potential lack of job opportunities with the growth of AI, some experts, as well as billionaires and politicians, have expressed the need for a universal basic income, or UBI, in order to supplement lower or no salaries and keep the economy afloat. The tech icons discussing the idea include Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Sam Altman.  Still, there is reason to be skeptical about the exact relationship between technology and jobs. In the late 1980s words of the godfather of productivity research, Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Solow, \"You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.\" That was known as Solow's productivity paradox, and the late 90s boom would challenge it. But later research would show there was in fact a murky relationship between the dotcom era and productivity gains. A co-author of that work at McKinsey told the Harvard Business Review that the embrace of Solow's view in relation to the 90s tech boom was \"oversimplified,\" and so was the view that came after it, that the internet drove the productivity boom. With these concerns, and unanswerable questions, in mind, Buffett said that human labor-intensive companies like Berkshire Hathaway need to consider a balance between how technology can help them become more efficient without endangering humans.  \"I don't know how you make sure that that's what happens any more than I know how to be sure that when you use two atomic bombs in World War II that you knew that you hadn't created something that could destroy the world later on,\" Buffett said.

    "content": "La 93 de ani, Warren Buffett se pregăteşte să predea cheile imperiului, dar tranziţia este plină de surprize, iar investitorii se uită speriaţi la planurile de succesiune.  La 93 de ani, Warren Buffett se pregăteşte să predea cheile imperiului    Legendarul investitor american Warren Buffet şi-a ales în sfârşit succesorul pentru tronul Berkshire Hathaway, însă alegerea lui Greg Abel i-a pus pe acţionari pe gânduri. Abel s-a făcut remarcat   în companie după ce a dus afacerile cu energie ale Berkshire pe noi culmi, scrie CNBC, citat de Business Magazin.     „Greg înţelege extraordinar de bine afacerile şi modelul de business. Las în mâna lui alocarea de capital”, a spus Waren Buffet.  Vezi mai multe articole din categoria economic     Comentariul lui Buffet a stârnit imediat dezbateri între acţionari. Unii l-au interpretat ca însemnând că Abel, vicepreşedinte al operaţiunilor de non-asigurări, nu numai că va face achiziţii în   viitor, dar va alege şi acţiuni pentru portofoliul de acţiuni de 360 de miliarde de dolari al Berkshire.     Alţii cred că Abel va fi mai degrabă dispus să delege responsabilitatea selectării acţiunilor.     „Cred că a vrut ca Abel să ia propriile decizii în ceea ce priveşte portofoliul de acţiuni, cât de mult din portofoliul de investiţii să fie alocat acţiunilor şi aşa mai departe\", a declarat pentru   CNBC Haruki Toyama, manager de portofoliu la Madison Investments, un acţionar al Berkshire.     Locotenenţii lui Buffett în materie de investiţii, Todd Combs şi Ted Weschler, au gestionat în mod independent aproximativ 15 miliarde de dolari fiecare pentru Berkshire în ultimul deceniu. Mulţi   au speculat că aceşti doi foşti manageri de fonduri speculative vor prelua în cele din urmă întregul portofoliu. Cu toate acestea, Buffett nu a dezvăluit istoricul lor din ultimii ani.     De asemenea, cei doi au ajutat Berkshire să încheie tranzacţii. În plus, Combs este directorul general al Geico, bijuteria coroanei din afacerea de asigurări a Berkshire.     Abel, în vârstă de 61 de ani, a devenit cunoscut ca moştenitorul aparent al lui Buffett în 2021, după ce Charlie Munger a făcut din greşeală această dezvăluire la adunarea acţionarilor din acel an.     Abel a supravegheat mari porţiuni din vastul imperiu al Berkshire, inclusiv energie, căi ferate şi retail, dar este cunoscut pentru expertiza sa în domeniul energiei, deoarece a lucrat la   predecesorul Berkshire Hathaway Energy din 1992.     Buffett, care va împlini 94 de ani în august, a recunoscut el însuşi că s-a răzgândit în privinţa planului de succesiune, menţionând că decizia sa este influenţată de cât de mult au crescut   activele Berkshire.     „Obişnuiam să gândesc altfel despre cum aş putea gestiona această situaţie, dar cred că această responsabilitatea ar trebui să fie a directorului general. Sumele au crescut mult la Berkshire şi nu   vrem să încercăm să avem în jur de 200 de persoane care să administreze câte un miliard de dolari fiecare. Pur şi simplu nu funcţionează” a spus Buffet.     Pe lângă portofoliul uriaş de acţiuni al Berkshire, rezervele de cash au crescut la aproape 189 de miliarde de dolari la sfârşitul lunii martie.

On Tuesday, Reddit (RDDT), whose message boards helped fuel the 2021 meme stock rally, will report its first quarterly results since going public and launch its own innovation of a sort, taking questions from the investing public that will be posted, but where else, on Reddit. Since Tesla's call back in 2019, we've seen several companies take a different approach to explaining their results. Robinhood (HOOD), to no one's surprise, has been at the forefront of remaking these quarterly updates, beginning their own calls with questions from retail investors. The company will report its latest quarterly results on Wednesday. In 2021, Robinhood also acquired Say Technologies, the company behind say.com, the service that powered shareholder-submitted calls for Tesla back in 2019. Coinbase (COIN), which, like Robinhood, made its public market debut in 2021 with a focus on its retail users and investors, began its call last week with questions from shareholders. And AMC (AMC), one of the most prominent companies in the meme stock craze, mixes in several questions from shareholders during its quarterly call. Its meme stock counterpart GameStop (GME), for its part, hasn't taken questions from analysts or shareholders following quarterly results since December 2020. And taking questions from investors isn't the only way conference calls have changed through the years. Years before Tesla's move to bring in shareholder questions, Netflix (NFLX) began its own innovation in the space, tasking a single analyst or IR exec with hosting what it calls an \"earnings interview.\" The company continues the practice today. This past weekend, many investors spent hours listening to Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett hold court with shareholders inside a basketball arena in Omaha, Neb. Berkshire has never hosted quarterly earnings calls. Over the years, the rules have considerably changed regarding how analysts can interact with company management and how companies communicate with the investing public. In short, more people have more information, and fewer people know anything special. Corporate communications has boomed. Sell-side research has dwindled. And the research arms of financial firms now resemble media companies, complete with newsletters, podcasts, and their own personalities. When Musk took his first question from shareholders, the appeal was immediately apparent. According to a transcript from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the first question was about \"service,\" which Musk had already addressed \"at length,\" according to Tesla's IR head Martin Viecha. The next question resembled much of the fare executives are accustomed to responding to from Wall Street analysts — \"How are you feeling about demand right now across the product line?\" In the five years since this call, the rise of the retail investor and the \"meme stock\" movement has continued to reshape this quarterly ritual. And Musk, for his part, has turned holding a colorful earnings call into an art form. Perhaps it's fitting, then, that at the end of Tesla's earnings call last month Viecha announced that it would be his last.

    "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis six-step method even works on deadline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This six-step method even works on deadline. Tom Corfman loves solving puzzles, such as helping a writer put a story together. He’s a senior consultant at Ragan Consulting Group, where he directs the Build Better Writers program. True storytellers choose the ingredients that make a good story. If they have them, then they have something worth telling. If they don’t, then they keep reporting. Or, like any good cook, they make the recipe using what they have. Joan Didion used another simile to explain how to structure a story. “Writing nonfiction is more like sculpture, a matter of shaping the research into the finished thing,” she told The Paris Review in 2006. The leaders of the podcast team at The Wall Street Journal outlined their story-structure method in March at the 2024 Boston University Power of Narrative conference. The Journal. (that’s not a typo) team has a six-item formula, which Nieman Storyboard has nicely summarized: The Journal team use their method on deadline, when many corporate communicators and reporters often complain there isn’t enough time to tell stories. “The narratives are always built from a strong news hook and rooted in a keen knowledge of narrative structure,” according to Nieman Storyboard. What’s their trick? They think like storytellers, arranging the facts to fit the structure of a good story. A motto for the rest of us: Tell the story, don’t let the story tell you. The Journal. checklist applies just as well to written-word stories and videos as it does to podcasts. We’ll take a close look at two recent episodes. “Will Getting Rid of the Bosses Fix the Workplace?”\nMarch 26, 2024 Find a character.  Bill Anderson, CEO of Bayer, hired in 2023. A 57-year-old biotech executive who previously was chief executive at two other companies. Create a timeline. The timeline begins at about 3:09, with Bayer’s founding in Germany in 1863, continues with recent troubles (stock price is down 50% since 2019) and Anderson’s hiring last year. In between, the story touches on Bayer’s financial challenges. Know your driving question. It’s in the title and again about 90 seconds in. “I was fascinated by this idea of a company trying to get by with sort of the bare minimum number of bosses,” reporter Chip Cutter says at 1:29. “Wait, is there any way this can work? Like what is this? What are they trying to achieve here?” Use a three-act structure. Act One, set up: The piece starts with jokes about middle managers at the beginning of the piece and continues with the new CEO’s listening tour of the company. Employees tell Anderson they have ideas, but they’re never heard because of the layers of management. Act Two: confrontation: The layoffs, including 40% of management jobs in the US pharma division, and Anderson’s proposal to reorganize the company, called “dynamic shared ownership.” At 8:47, Host Ryan Knutson says, “The CEO’s job is on the line, but the fate of this company is too, in a lot of ways.” Most of the report focuses on Anderson’s explanation of his plan and the points of tension during the rollout. Act Three, the resolution. “He is on to something here,” Cutter says at about 16:58, but getting from here to there comes with a note of uncertainty. “We’re going to see over the next year as this plays out like what happens at Bayer,” he adds at 18:02 It has to mean something. Why should the audience care? This is addressed in the first sentence: “Hating on your boss is kind of a national pastime, especially if you’re the kind of middle manager that doesn’t have much power but really wants it.” And near the end, Cutter is asked if Anderson’s plan could “change corporate America,” at 16:48. “I think it could be really powerful,” Cutter responds, “like a lot of employees are not happy in their corporate jobs, they feel like it’s just frustrating day-to-day.” “Charlie Munger: Curmudgeon, Sage and Investing Legend”\nDec. 1, 2023 Find a character. Munger, vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, who died in November at age 99. Create a timeline. The episode weaves the chronology into the episode: Know your driving question. “Why so many people wanted to hear what Charlie Munger had to say,” Knutson says at 2:11. Use a three-act structure. Act One, set up: The story begins by enticing listeners to learn more about Munger even if he wasn’t a “legendary investor.” He brought the wisdom of a tireless elder who in 2019 outlasted Journal columnist Jason Zweig and a colleague at a six-hour dinner. Act Two: confrontation: With Munger’s insights and one-liners, the story explores the driving question. While there isn’t a direct confrontation, like the Bayer story, there’s a subtle point of tension, summed up by Knutson’s question to Zweig: “A lot of people sort of seem to think that Munger was Warren Buffett’s sidekick, but is that fair?” Why did people listen to the No. 2, and how did that feel to Munger? Act Three, the resolution. The story makes the case that Munger was smart, funny and didn’t have a big ego. And another quality. “A lot of people think of capitalism as a like dog-eat-dog system, and that’s not the way he thought of it,” Zweig says. “And it’s not the way he practiced it. That’s really extraordinary and I think it comes from his background. Where else could it come from?” It has to mean something. The Journal. staff doesn’t assume that its readers know why Munger is important. “This week, Charlie Munger died,” Knutson says in the open. “He was a legendary investor and vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, one of the most valuable companies in the world.” Stay focused\nThe sixth element of the podcast team’s formula should guide the reporting, uncovering the facts needed to fill in the other five elements. But it’s also very handy for editors trying to organize a piece. Katherine Brewer, a senior editor at The Journal., said at the conference, “Know your driving question, know what you want your timeline to be, and stay within the walls of that.” Follow RCG on LinkedIn.   \nTopics: Brand Storytelling, Comms Week, Storytelling  Topics: Brand Storytelling, Comms Week, Storytelling \nName \n\n \nMail (will not be published) \n\n \nWebsite\n\n  \n\n\n\n PITCH US Sign up to receive the latest articles from Ragan.com directly in your inbox.

    "content": "Dono de uma fortuna estimada em US$ 131,7 bilhões segundo a revista Forbes, o megainvestidor Warren Buffett comandou no último sábado (4) a conferência anual da Berkshire Hathaway, conglomerado de investimentos que construiu ao lado de Charlie Munger. A parceria bem-sucedida da dupla traz inúmeros ensinamentos para os investidores. A 60ª conferência anual da Berkshire Hathaway aconteceu no último sábado (4). O evento foi marcado por homenagens a Munger, que faleceu em novembro do ano passado, e os anúncios de redução de 13% da participação da empresa na Apple e da evolução do caixa disponível a companhia para US$ 189 bilhões, o equivalente a R$ 955 bilhões na cotação atual do dólar. Relatório mostra ensinamentos dos megainvestidores. No dia da conferência, o analista Henrique Vasconcellos, da Nord Investimentos, publicou uma lista com as principais lições a serem aprendidas a partir da trajetória de Buffett e Munger à frente do conglomerado de investimentos. Juca Kfouri A boa convocação da seleção com o ataque REV Sakamoto Mentiras dificultam a chegada de socorro no RS Jamil Chade Negacionistas tentam calar cientistas e imprensa Milly Lacombe A comovente união entre Grêmio e Inter no RS O patrimônio de Buffett foi quase todo construído após os 65 anos. Segundo Vasconcellos, mais de 95% da fortuna do megainvestidor foi obtida com o efeito dos juros compostos sobre o dinheiro. Tal movimento indica a importância de olhar para os investimentos no longo prazo. Uma vez que você entende o efeito do tempo e dos juros compostos sobre o seu dinheiro, a única questão a ser solucionada é trabalhar o psicológico para ter esse horizonte de longo prazo enraizado em sua mente.Henrique Vasconcellos Outro ensinamento de Buffett é de não se endividar para realizar investimentos. Em uma das conferências da Berkshire Hathaway, ele parafraseou Munger e mencionou o álcool, o amor e a alavancagem como \"as três maneiras de uma pessoa esperta quebrar\". A alavancagem é um termo utilizado para multiplicar certa rentabilidade a partir do endividamento. As operações citadas pelo bilionário como um risco permitem que seja investido um valor maior do que o patrimônio pessoal ou da empresa. Invista em empresas simples, compreensíveis e fáceis de administrar. A procura de Buffett por companhias como a Coca-Cola, mostra uma lição dele ao preferir negócios de fácil entendimento dos detalhes que levam a empresa ao sucesso. O ensinamento considera que os bons investimentos conseguem se sustentar mesmo com erros de gestão. Bancos, serviços de pagamentos e petroleiras são áreas que têm presença garantida. Também presente na carteira do bilionário, a Apple poderia fugir do conceito adotado. Vasconcellos, no entanto, observa que a empresa é vista por Buffett como uma vendedora de aparelhos eletrônicos. \"Pechinchas\" não são mais as melhores opções. Para os sócios da Berkshire Hathaway, as aquisições baratas sem considerar a qualidade do negócio não são as melhores opções dos dias atuais. Segundo Munger costumava dizer, \"uma boa empresa a um preço aceitável é muito superior a uma empresa ruim a um preço baixo\". Escolha por negócios capazes de reinvestir seus lucros. As altas taxas de retorno e o reinvestimento também é visto como determinante para o crescimento das companhias consideradas bons investimentos. Aposte em empresas que conseguem repassar seus custos por meio das receitas. A empresa de chocolates See's Candies é recorrentemente lembrada por Buffett como um caso positivo de mudança da forma de enxergar os investimentos. A compra de produtos da marca para presentear permitia que a empresa repassasse seus custos de forma mais natural. Newsletter POR DENTRO DA BOLSA Receba diariamente análises exclusivas da equipe do PagBank e saiba tudo que movimenta o mercado de ações. Uma forma de monitorar isso é por meio das margens das empresas. Se ela estiver crescendo e perdendo margem, provavelmente não consegue repassar os preços, mas apenas ganhar escala.Henrique Vasconcellos Investidores têm que lidar com a oscilação dos ativos escolhidos. Como o mercado financeiro vive de ciclos, haverá períodos de desempenho ruins e, por isso, é importante estar mentalmente consciente das decisões. Foco e disciplina na estratégia escolhida é fundamental. Caso fique \"pulando de galho em galho\" em busca por diferentes modalidades rentáveis, o mercado por te derrotar em todas as estratégias. Use a volatilidade como sua aliada. Ainda que o movimento de queda de preço dos ativos seja prejudicial ao bolso, o movimento representa uma janela de negócios para o longo prazo. Deixe que os gestores se preocupem com a volatilidade em curtos períodos. A carteira de Buffett tem exposição em empresas consolidadas. Mesmo com a redução de 13% da sua participação na Apple, a empresa segue com 27% do portfólio da empresa. A sua melhor ideia tem que ter um peso maior do que as ideias que você não tem a mesma confiança.Henrique Vasconcellos Data e local: quais são os próximos jogos da seleção brasileira Quem é a principal ausência na lista da seleção para a Copa América?

    "content": "Elon Musk offer Tesla Shares to Warren Buffett: दुनिया की सबसे बड़ी इलेक्ट्रिक वीईकल कंपनी टेस्ला के सीईओ एलॉन मस्क ने वॉरेन बफेट को टेस्ला में निवेश करने का सुझाव दिया है। उन्होंने यह सुझाव बर्कशायर हाथवे के शेयरहोल्डर्स की सालाना बैठक में हुई चर्चा के दौरान टिप्पणियों के मद्देनजर दिया है। वैसे दिलचस्प बात ये है कि दिग्गज निवेशक वॉरेन बफेट लंबे समय से चाइनीज कंपनी BYD के निवेशक हैं जो टेस्ला की प्रतिद्वंद्वी कंपनी है। पिछले दो वर्षों में उन्होंने बीवाईडी में अपनी होल्डिंग कम की है लेकिन अब भी उनके पास इसके काफी शेयर्स हैं।  Warren Buffett ने क्या कहा था?  टेस्ला का फोकस ऑटोमैटिक कार पर है। इसे लेकर अरबपति वॉरेन बफेट ने कुछ ही दिन पहले कहा था कि अगर यह सफल होती है तो बर्कशायर (Berkshire) की जेईको (Geico) जैसी ऑटो इंश्योरेंस कंपनियों को खतरा है। उन्होंने कहा था कि अगर दुर्घटनाएं 50 फीसदी कम हो जाती हैं तो यह सोसायटी के लिए अच्छा है लेकिन इंश्योरेंस कंपनियों के लिए नहीं। हालांकि उन्होंन आगे यह भी कहा कि हम सभी सोसायटी की भलाई ही चाहते हैं।  बर्कशायर हाथवे (Berkshire Hathaway) के एग्जेक्यूटिव अजीत जैन ने एनुअल मीटिंग के दौरान कहा कि टेस्ला महसूस करती है कि इसकी तकनीक की वजह से ही ऑटो एक्सीडेंट्स की संख्या में गिरावट आ रही है लेकिन हर एक्सीडेंट में रिपेयरिंग की कॉस्ट बढ़ रही है यानी कि ओवरऑल खर्च पर कुछ खास फर्क नहीं पड़ रहा है। अजीत ने आगे यह भी कहा कि टेस्ला इंश्योरेंस अभी तक अधिक सफल नहीं रहा है। उन्होंने कहा कि यह तो आने वाला समय बताएगा कि वास्तविक स्थिति क्या है लेकिन ऑटोमैटिक सिस्टम ने खर्च का एक बड़ा हिस्सा ऑपरेटर से इक्विपमेंट प्रोवाइडर की तरफ शिफ्ट कर दिया है।  Elon Musk की फिर कैसी रही प्रतिक्रिया?  इन सब बातों को लेकर एलॉन मस्क ने X (पूर्व नाम Twitter) पर ट्वीट किया कि वॉरेन बफेट को टेस्ला में कोई पद लेना चाहिए। यह एक स्वाभाविक कदम है। इससे पहले टेस्ला के अर्निंग्स कॉल में एलॉन मस्क ने कहा था कि टेस्ला पूरी तरह से ऑटोमैटिक होने जा रही है और अगर किसी को इस पर भरोसा नहीं है तो उन्हें टेस्ला में निवेशक नहीं रहना चाहिए। टेस्ला के एआई इंफ्रा पर 100 करोड़ डॉलर के खर्च के चलते फ्री कैश फ्लो मार्च तिमाही में 250 करोड़ डॉलर के निगेटिव में चला गया।  Rahul Gandhi Controversy: IIT और SAT की तुलना पर मिला-जुला रिस्पांस, ये है पूरा मामला First Published: May 07, 2024 1:53 PM हिंदी में शेयर बाजार,  स्टॉक मार्केट न्यूज़,  बिजनेस न्यूज़,  पर्सनल फाइनेंस और अन्य देश से जुड़ी खबरें सबसे पहले मनीकंट्रोल हिंदी पर पढ़ें. डेली मार्केट अपडेट के लिए Moneycontrol App  डाउनलोड करें। "

    "content": "Se tem alguém no mundo que entende de tendências e dinheiro, esse alguém é Warren Buffett. Conhecido como o mega investidor, ou o maior investidor da história, ou ainda o “Oráculo de Omaha”, em referência à cidade do meio-oeste americano onde ele nasceu, Buffett é uma referência quando o assunto são finanças. E não é para menos. Tem quase 94 anos, mais de 80 de experiência e mantém um desempenho notável na bolsa: ele tem um retorno médio de mais de 20% ao ano nas últimas cinco décadas. Não à toa figura religiosamente na lista dos principais bilionários do planeta, elaborada pela Revista Forbes. E, dessa vez, Buffett tem um recado sobre as novas Inteligências Artificiais. Leia mais Durante a reunião anual de acionistas da empresa de investimentos dele, a Berkshire Hathaway, no sábado (4), Buffett falou longamente sobre o impacto que a IA pode ter na vida das pessoas. Disse que a tecnologia tem, claro, pontos positivos, mas destacou que, para ele, os negativos se sobrepõem, principalmente no aspecto de ser uma verdadeira máquina de desinformação: “Quando você pensa sobre o potencial para enganar as pessoas… se eu estivesse interessado em investir em golpes, seria a indústria em crescimento de todos os tempos e, de certa forma, é possibilitada pela IA”, disse o mega investidor. “Obviamente, a IA também tem potencial para coisas boas, mas… eu acho que, como alguém que não entende absolutamente nada sobre isso, ela tem um enorme potencial para o bem e um enorme potencial para causar danos”, concluiu o bilionário. Warren Buffett começou a falar sobre IA generativa após citar que viu recentemente uma imagem dele gerada pela tecnologia. E ele se assustou com o quanto ela parecia real. Mais do que isso. A Inteligência Artificial tem sido assunto dentro de Wall Street há mais de um ano. Os investidores acreditam que a novidade possa gerar lucros maiores no futuro. Para Buffett, no entanto, a sociedade precisa abraçar essa tendência com cuidado. Neste ponto, ele traçou uma comparação entre a IA e a bomba atômica: “Não sei nada sobre IA. Isso não significa que eu negue sua existência ou importância ou qualquer coisa do tipo. Mas deixamos o gênio sair da garrafa quando desenvolvemos armas nucleares e esse gênio tem feito coisas terríveis ultimamente, e o poder desse gênio é o que me assusta muito. Não conheço nenhuma maneira de colocar o gênio de volta na garrafa, e a IA é um tanto semelhante”, declarou o mega investidor. As informações são da CNBC. Como já dissemos, Warren Buffett é considerado um dos maiores e mais importantes investidores da história e figura também na lista dos mais ricos do planeta. Em 2024, sua fortuna foi estimada em quase US$ 132 bilhões, segundo o Ranking da Forbes. O patrimônio vem de sua atuação como presidente e principal acionista da Berkshire Hathaway, empresa de investimentos fundada na década de 60. Atualmente, a companhia possui participações em gigantes do mercado, como a Apple, a Coca-Cola, a Visa e a Kraft-Heinz. Buffett foi um verdadeiro prodígio nesse mundo. Filho do corretor de ações Howard Buffet, ele nasceu durante a Grande Depressão nos Estados Unidos, viu seu pai perder o emprego e abrir uma empresa própria de investimentos. Aos 11 anos, o “Oráculo de Omaha” fez sua primeira aquisição na bolsa: três ações da Cities Services, conhecida atualmente como Citgo, dona de refinarias. Buffett também é conhecido como o maior filantropo da história. Depois da morte da sua ex-esposa e ativista, Susan Buffett, ele decidiu doar toda a parte dela na Berkshire à Bill & Melissa Gates Foundation, do bilionário e amigo Bill Gates. De 2006 para cá, Buffett já doou US$ 34 bilhões e segue fazendo transferências anuais para a caridade. Roberto (Bob) Furuya é formado em Jornalismo pela Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie e atua na área desde 2010. Passou pelas redações da Jovem Pan e da BandNews FM. Bruno Capozzi é jornalista formado pela Faculdade Cásper Líbero e mestre em Ciências Sociais pela PUC-SP, tendo como foco a pesquisa de redes sociais e tecnologia."

    "content": "TVN24 Biznes | Ze świata TVN24 Biznes | Ze świata Warren Buffett, 93-letni miliarder i szef holdingu Berkshire Hathaway, poważnie zastanawia się nad swoją przyszłością. Powiedział akcjonariuszom, że jeśli będzie miał szczęście, to może pozostać na stanowisku kolejne sześć lub siedem lat. Ale jednocześnie zaznaczył, że \"to może się skończyć jutro\". Na sobotnim zgromadzeniu pojawiło się dziesiątki tysięcy akcjonariuszy Berkshire Hathaway. Wszystko po to, aby osobiście zobaczyć \"Wyrocznię z Omaha\", jak nazywany jest Warren Buffett.  - Tłumy będą mniejsze, gdy nie będzie tu Buffetta, ale firma sobie poradzi - ocenił Jason Garner, 20-letni student z Queens University w Kingston, w kanadyjskiej prowincji Ontario. Akcjonariusze mają nadzieję, że jego rządy nie skończą się tak szybko, ale nie martwią się o swoje inwestycje. Buffett kieruje firmą ze swojego rodzinnego miasta Omaha od 1965 roku. Berkshire Hathaway to konglomerat o wartości 865 miliardów dolarów. W skład holdingu wchodzą dziesiątki firm, m.in. Geico z branży ubezpieczeniowej, BNSF zajmujące się towarowym transportem kolejowym oraz Dairy Queen, czyli sieć barów szybkiej obsługi. Firma Berkshire zamknęła 2023 rok z zyskiem na poziomie 96,2 mld dolarów, co jest znaczną zmianą w porównaniu z 2022 rokiem, gdy odnotowała stratę w wysokości 22,8 mld dolarów. Reuters zauważył, że śmierć w listopadzie 2023 roku Charliego Mungera, wieloletniego partnera biznesowego Buffetta, w wieku 99 lat, sprawiła, że wiek legendarnego inwestora znalazł się w centrum uwagi tegorocznego zgromadzenia akcjonariuszy. - Warren powiedział, że Berkshire jest zbudowane tak, aby trwać - powiedział Mike Lin, analityk finansowy z Kantonu w Chinach. Lygia Bulle, planistka finansowa z Kurytyby w Brazylii, zabrała na spotkanie swoich 17-letnich i 19-letnich synów. - Warren Buffett jest największym inwestorem na świecie - podkreśliła. - Zobaczenie go osobiście ma inną siłę, niż obserwacja z domu - dodała Bulle.\r Według relacji agencji Reutera tysiące akcjonariuszy czekało nawet 12 godzin w kolejce, aby wejść do hali i móc posłuchać Buffetta osobiście.\r Buffett przyznał, że ten czas nadejdzie, być może wkrótce, wybuchając śmiechem po tym, jak powiedział akcjonariuszom: \"Nie tylko mam nadzieję, że pojawicie się w przyszłym roku, ale mam nadzieję, że ja też będę w przyszłym roku\". Bankier Richard Callahan powiedział, że Buffetta mniej widać na ulicach miasta Omaha. - Mieszkam i pracuję w tej samej okolicy. Nie widać go tak często w jego samochodzie, a raz na jakiś czas można go zobaczyć z kierowcą - powiedział. Ale 57-latek wciąż podziwia Buffetta. - 93 lata? Mogę mieć tylko nadzieję, że będę funkcjonował tak jak on - podkreślił Callahan. Buffett nazwał weekendowe spotkanie \"Woodstockiem dla kapitalistów\". Zgodnie z Bloomberg Billionaires Index fortunę inwestora szacuje się na 133 mld dolarów. Buffett jest klasyfikowany na dziewiątej pozycji w ranking najbogatszych ludzi na świecie. Zestawienie Bloomberg Billionaires Index jest aktualizowane każdego dnia po zakończeniu notowań na nowojorskiej giełdzie.  Autorka/Autor:mb/ams Źródło: Reuters Źródło zdjęcia głównego: photosince/Shutterstock Prezydent Andrzej Duda skierował do Trybunału Konstytucyjnego w trybie kontroli następczej przepisy dotyczące wakacji kredytowych w 2024 roku.

Nowa technologia została dostrzeżona także przez Warrena Buffetta – miliarder porównuje nowość do wynalezienia bomby jądrowej i przestrzega przed zagrożeniami związanymi z jej wykorzystaniem. \n             Sztuczna inteligencja (AI) staje się coraz bardziej powszechna w różnych dziedzinach życia, od medycyny i edukacji po rozrywkę i transport, zmieniając sposób, w jaki pracujemy, uczymy się i komunikujemy. Technologia nieustannie się rozwija, przynosi nie tylko nowe możliwości, ale także stawia przed społeczeństwem wyzwania. Obejrzyj w  Warren Buffett, podczas spotkania akcjonariuszy holdingu Berkshire Hathaway, zwrócił uwagę na zagrożenia związane ze sztuczną inteligencją. Według miliardera, szczególnie niebezpieczne są nowe, podstępniejsze oszustwa.  rozwiń \"Chodzi mi o to, że oszustwa zawsze były częścią amerykańskiej sceny, ale to sprawiłoby, że gdybym był zainteresowany inwestowaniem w oszustwa, to będzie to rozwijająca się branża wszechczasów. I jest to w pewien sposób możliwe.\" “Oczywiście sztuczna inteligencja ma również potencjał do dobrych rzeczy, ale... Jako osoba, która nic z tego nie rozumie, uważam, że sztuczna inteligencja ma ogromny potencjał dobra i ogromny potencjał krzywdy - i po prostu nie wiem, jak to się potoczy\"  Buffett porównał wynalezienie sztucznej inteligencji do wynalezienia broni jądrowej, która została wykorzystana do strasznych rzeczy.  “Nie wiem nic o sztucznej inteligencji. Nie oznacza to, że zaprzeczam jej istnieniu, znaczeniu czy czymkolwiek w tym rodzaju\" - powiedział Buffett, wypowiadając się ostrożnym tonem. \"Wypuściliśmy dżina z butelki, kiedy opracowaliśmy broń jądrową i ten dżin robił ostatnio straszne rzeczy, a jego moc jest tym, co mnie przeraża\".  “Nie znam żadnego sposobu na ponowne zamknięcie dżina w butelce, a sztuczna inteligencja jest nieco podobna. Jest to część wyjścia z butelki i jest to niezwykle ważne i zostanie wykonane przez kogoś ... czy zmieni to przyszłość społeczeństwa, dowiemy się później\" - dodał Buffett.  Wypowiedź Buffetta wydaje się ostrożna lub nawet negatywna. Warto jednak zaznaczyć, że miliarder ma niezbyt miłe doświadczenia z technologią. Jakiś czas temu cyberprzestępcy wykorzystali jego wizerunek do stworzenia scamu, który miał zachęcać do fałszywych inwestycji (to powszechny schemat oszustwa, w którym był wykorzystywany nawet wizerunek polskich polityków).  Źródło: CNBC, Bitcoin Przeczytaj także:Sora w akcji.

    "content": "Asian shares are mixed after U.S. stocks held relatively steady on Wall Street TOKYO -- Asian shares were mixed on Wednesday after U.S. stocks held relatively steady on Wall Street.  U.S. futures and oil prices slipped, while the yen weakened further against the U.S. dollar.  Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 1.5% to 38,244.76. Nintendo Co.’s share price sank 5.2% after the company’s forecasts disappointed investors and it announced that news of a successor product to its popular Switch device will be made by March 2025.  Market players are watching to see how authorities react to the yen's persisting weakness against the U.S. dollar.  The dollar rose to 155.14 Japanese yen from 154.50 yen. Japanese officials have expressed concern after the yen's value slipped to 160.25 per dollar in recent days, prompting the Ministry of Finance to intervene.  “Exchange-rate moves could have a big impact on the economy and prices, so there’s a chance we may need to respond with monetary policy,” Kazuo Ueda, governor of the Bank of Japan, told lawmakers on Wednesday. A weak yen helps the profits of Japanese companies that earn much of their revenue overseas, but fluctuations in rates can upend planning and the yen's weakness has severely eroded the purchasing power of both households and businesses, pushing up costs of imports of food and energy, among other things.  Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed 0.4% to 18,410.20 and the Shanghai Composite index also gave up 0.4%, falling to 3,134.75.  Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was little changed at 7,795.70, while the Kospi in South Korea edged 0.1% higher, to 2,736.20.  Taiwan's Taiex was up 0.1%.  On Tuesday, the S&P 500 edged 0.1% higher, to 5,187.70. It was a quiet day following three straight leaps for the index of at least 0.9%.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1%, to 38,884.26, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1%, to 16,332.56. Kenvue, the company whose brands include Band-Aids and Tylenol, rose 6.4% after topping analysts’ forecasts for both profit and revenue in the latest quarter. The Walt Disney Co. sank 9.5% despite reporting stronger results for its latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell a bit shy of forecasts, and it expects its entertainment streaming business to soften in the current quarter. They’re among the tail end of companies reporting their results for the first three months of the year. Most companies have beat their forecasts for earnings, but they’re not getting as big a boost to their stock prices afterward as they usually do, according to FactSet. Not only that, companies that fall short of profit expectations have seen their stock prices sink by more the following day than they have historically. That could suggest investors are listening to critics who have been calling the U.S. stock market broadly too expensive following its run to records this year. For stock prices to climb further, either profits will need to grow more or interest rates will need to fall. Wall Street still considers the latter a possibility this year following some events last week that traders found encouraging. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high. In other trading, U.S. benchmark crude oil fell 33 cents to $78.05 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 10 cents on Tuesday to $78.38 per barrel. Brent crude oil, the international standard, declined 38 cents to $82.78 per barrel. The euro dropped to $1.0742 from $1.0755.  ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.  24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

U.S. futures and oil prices slipped, while the yen weakened further against the U.S. dollar.  Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 1.5% to 38,244.76. Nintendo Co.’s share price sank 5.2% after the company’s forecasts disappointed investors and it announced that news of a successor product to its popular Switch device will be made by March 2025.  Market players are watching to see how authorities react to the yen's persisting weakness against the U.S. dollar.  The dollar rose to 155.14 Japanese yen from 154.50 yen. Japanese officials have expressed concern after the yen's value slipped to 160.25 per dollar in recent days, prompting the Ministry of Finance to intervene.  “Exchange-rate moves could have a big impact on the economy and prices, so there’s a chance we may need to respond with monetary policy,” Kazuo Ueda, governor of the Bank of Japan, told lawmakers on Wednesday. A weak yen helps the profits of Japanese companies that earn much of their revenue overseas, but fluctuations in rates can upend planning and the yen's weakness has severely eroded the purchasing power of both households and businesses, pushing up costs of imports of food and energy, among other things.  Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed 0.4% to 18,410.20 and the Shanghai Composite index also gave up 0.4%, falling to 3,134.75.  Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was little changed at 7,795.70, while the Kospi in South Korea edged 0.1% higher, to 2,736.20.  Taiwan's Taiex was up 0.1%.  On Tuesday, the S&P 500 edged 0.1% higher, to 5,187.70. It was a quiet day following three straight leaps for the index of at least 0.9%.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1%, to 38,884.26, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1%, to 16,332.56. Kenvue, the company whose brands include Band-Aids and Tylenol, rose 6.4% after topping analysts’ forecasts for both profit and revenue in the latest quarter. The Walt Disney Co. sank 9.5% despite reporting stronger results for its latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell a bit shy of forecasts, and it expects its entertainment streaming business to soften in the current quarter. They’re among the tail end of companies reporting their results for the first three months of the year. Most companies have beat their forecasts for earnings, but they’re not getting as big a boost to their stock prices afterward as they usually do, according to FactSet. Not only that, companies that fall short of profit expectations have seen their stock prices sink by more the following day than they have historically. That could suggest investors are listening to critics who have been calling the U.S. stock market broadly too expensive following its run to records this year. For stock prices to climb further, either profits will need to grow more or interest rates will need to fall. Wall Street still considers the latter a possibility this year following some events last week that traders found encouraging. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high. In other trading, U.S. benchmark crude oil fell 33 cents to $78.05 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 10 cents on Tuesday to $78.38 per barrel. Brent crude oil, the international standard, declined 38 cents to $82.78 per barrel. The euro dropped to $1.0742 from $1.0755.  ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.  24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

In particolare, i risultati sopra le attese hanno spinto Davide Campari e Unicredit in cima al FTSE MIB , mentre Ferrari , che pure ha messo a segno buoni risultati, è rimasta in coda. In rialzo anche il CAC 40 di Parigi, il DAX 40 di Francoforte, l’IBEX 35 di Madrid, l’AEX di Amsterdam e il FT-SE 100 di Londra. Gli investitori, intanto, continuano a interrogarsi sulle mosse delle banche centrali e soprattutto di quella americana: non è chiaro se procederà con due o solamente un solo taglio del costo del denaro nel corso dell’anno. Spreaker A Piazza Affari sono scattate al rialzo le azioni di Unicredit, spinte dai conti del primo trimestre risultati superiori alle attese. La banca ha registrato un utile netto di 2,6 miliardi, in crescita del 23,9% rispetto allo stesso periodo del 2023 e superiore ai 2,1 miliardi previsti dal consensus degli analisti. In più i vertici hanno rivisto al rialzo la guidance sui risultati e sulla distribuzione di capitale agli azionisti relativi all’esercizio 2024: in particolare è stato indicato un utile 2024 «superiore a 8,5 miliardi» mentre in precedenza stimava un risultato «sostanzialmente in linea con il 2023», quando era stato di 8,6 miliardi. L’aggiornamento della guidance per i prossimi esercizi, commentano gli analisti di Ubs, «suggerisce una traiettoria degli utili migliore del previsto». E’ stato anche confermato il payout complessivo di almeno il 90% dell’utile, con la parte cash ad almeno il 40% e il resto con buyback azionari. Wall Street chiude contrastata, con l’S&P 500 in lieve rialzo dello 0,13% a 5.187,71 punti e il Dow Jones sopra la parità dello 0,08% a 38.883,8 punti, mentre il Nasdaq è in lieve calo dello 0,1% a 16.332,56 punti. Kenvue, l’azienda i cui marchi includono cerotti e Tylenol, è salita del 6,73% dopo aver superato le previsioni degli analisti sia per quanto riguarda gli utili che i ricavi dell’ultimo trimestre. Walt Disney Co. è scesa del 9,27% nonostante i risultati dell’ultimo trimestre siano stati superiori alle aspettative degli analisti. Il suo fatturato è stato leggermente inferiore alle previsioni e si aspetta che la sua attività di streaming di intrattenimento si attenui nel trimestre in corso. Si tratta di una delle ultime società che hanno comunicato i risultati dei primi tre mesi dell’anno. Secondo FactSet, la maggior parte delle società ha finora battuto le previsioni di guadagno, ma non ha ottenuto una spinta così forte sui prezzi delle azioni come di solito accade. Non solo, le società che non hanno rispettato le aspettative di profitto hanno visto i loro prezzi azionari scendere il giorno successivo più di quanto non abbiano fatto storicamente. Questo potrebbe far pensare che gli investitori stiano ascoltando i critici che hanno definito il mercato azionario statunitense ampiamente troppo costoso dopo la corsa ai record di quest’anno. Affinché i prezzi delle azioni salgano ulteriormente, è necessario che gli utili crescano in modo più dinamico o che i tassi di interesse scendano. Quest’ultima ipotesi sembra ancora possibile a Wall Street dopo alcuni eventi della scorsa settimana che gli operatori hanno trovato incoraggianti. Sono sotto la lente anche le Banca Mps, dopo la pubblicazione dei numeri del primo trimestre, archiviati con un utile netto di 333 milioni, in crescita del 41% rispetto al risultato dello stesso trimestre 2023 e superiore alle stime di consenso degli analisti (280 milioni). I titoli sono tuttavia volatili dopo la recente corsa. L’ad, Luigi Lovaglio, ha comunque sostenuto il corso delle azioni asserendo che l’utile pre-tasse 2024 sarà superiore a quello dell’anno scorso e che l’istituto non intende pensare ad acquisizioni di asset bancari. «Ovvio che non faremo acquisizione di asset bancari, sappiamo di avere una posizione di capitale molto forte, forse ci sarà un approccio diverso nel nuovo piano sulla politica dei dividendi», ha dichiarato. Sono poco mosse le Finecobank dopo la trimestrale, mentre le Amplifon continuano a correre all’indomani della diffusione dei conti. Ed ancora sono in evidenza le Stmicroelectronics , in vivace rialzo sulla scia delle tedesche Infineon (a dispetto, quest’ultime, della trimestrale in calo), le Snam Rete Gas e le Davide Campari. Quest’ultime hanno chiuso il primo trimestre con un utile ante imposte di 145 milioni, in rialzo dell’8,6%. Telecom Italia è fiacca, nonostante Tim Brasil che abbia registrato il miglior primo trimestre della sua storia. Ed ancora, ha registrato una forte frenata Ferrari , nonostante la società abbia annunciato di aver registrato nei primi tre mesi dell’anno un utile netto 352 milioni di euro, in crescita del 19% rispetto allo stesso periodo di un anno fa e contro un consensus di 337 milioni. I vertici hanno anche confermato le attese per fine anno. Fuori dal listino principale, corrono le Anima Holding all’indomani della trimestrale e dell’annuncio della politica di remunerazione degli azionisti, con il lancio del buyback da 40 milioni. Scivolano invece le Iren , sulla notizia delle misure cautelari dell’amministratore delegato, Paolo Emilio Signorini, insieme al presidente della Regione Liguria, Giovanni Toti. Sul fronte macroeconomico, gli ordini al settore manifatturiero a marzo in  Germania  hanno segnato una diminuzione dello 0,4% su base mensile e del 1,9% su base annua, mentre il surplus commerciale tedesco ha raggiunto 22,3 miliardi di euro, inferiore alle stime ma superiore ai 21,4 miliardi di euro di febbraio 2024. E’ inoltre emerso che a marzo il volume delle vendite al dettaglio nell’area euro è aumentato dello 0,8% rispetto a febbraio, dell’1,2% nella Ue. A febbraio erano calate dello 0,3%e dello 0,1%. Rispetto a un anno prima +0,7% e +2% rispettivamente. Il focus degli investitori rimane ad ogni modo sulle mosse delle banche centrali: in Europa resta alta la fiducia su un prossimo taglio dei  tassi d’interesse , mentre la situazione è meno chiara negli States, con i dati macro a luci e ombra. Alla vigilia il presidente della Fed di New York, John Williams, ha assicurato che un taglio dei tassi ci sarà, ma che l’attuale livello di politica monetaria è comunque «in una buona posizione», senza negare che la sorpresa sugli ultimi dati sull’inflazione Usa siano una fonte di preoccupazione. Intanto, la Reserve Bank of Australia ha mantenuto invariato il target del tasso di liquidità al 4,35% e il tasso di interesse pagato sui saldi di Exchange Settlement al 4,25%, in quanto l’inflazione sta calando più lentamente del previsto. In settimana si riuniranno anche gli istituti centrali brasiliano, polacco e svedese. Chiusura fiacca per lo spread tra BTp e Bund. In finale di seduta il differenziale di rendimento tra il BTp decennale benchmark (Isin IT0005560948) e il Bund tedesco di pari durata si è attestato a 134 punti, uno in più rispetto alla chiusura precedente. In calo il rendimento del BTp decennale benchmark che ha segnato un’ultima posizione al 3,76%, rispetto al 3,79% della chiusura della vigilia. Il rendimento del Bund è sceso dal 2,47 al 2,42 per cento. Sul valutario, l’euro scambia a 1,077 dollari (in linea con il closing della vigilia) e 166,44 yen (da 165,9). Il cambio dollaro/yen è a 154,42 (da 153,9). Vira in negativo il prezzo del petrolio con il Brent luglio a 83,01 dollari al barile (-0,38%) e il Wti giugno a 78,28 dollari (-0,29%). In calo anche il prezzo del gas naturale scambiato ad Amsterdam a 31,09 euro al megawattora (-2,2%).

    "description": "Embattled broadcaster Network 10 is facing “serious turmoil” amid failing programs, sliding ratings, an ad revenue crisis, and a messy ownership battle at its American parent company.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-07T04:43:21Z",
    "content": "Australian commercial TV will likely be reduced to just two players by the end of the decade, experts say, with Ten in a bad position. Embattled broadcaster Network 10 is facing “serious turmoil” amid failing programs, sliding ratings, an ad revenue crisis, and a messy ownership battle at its American parent company. News today that glitzy reality series The Masked Singer and major franchise The Bachelor have been axed is the latest sign of the company’s deepening woes – and its existence is in doubt. Queensland University of Technology Professor Amanda Lotz, who leads the Transforming Media Industries research program, said it’s unlikely Australia will still have three free-to-air commercial networks in the near future. “I would suspect by the end of the decade that we will have two commercial broadcasters,” Prof Lotz said. “It’s just math. We’re now in a death spiral. And eventually, it might be that we just have one.” QUT Professor Anna Potter, an expert in digital media and cultural studies, agreed that the landscape is now so stretched that television businesses are dangerously unviable. “I think there’s a big question too about whether Australia can support three television (commercial) broadcasters – and I’m not sure we can,” Prof Potter said. But the network’s failure to meaningfully grow its share of audience coupled with an increasingly disrupted advertising market have almost been eclipsed by Ten’s messy ownership, media analyst and Pearman director of strategy and research Steve Allen said. “A new owner of Paramount Global is unlikely to see Ten as an asset worth retaining because the business is in serious turmoil,” Mr Allen told news.com.au. “There’s no programming momentum and they haven’t found a really solid anchor for prime time, their revenue looks steady but they can’t seem to significantly reduce overheads, and now there’s upheaval in terms of their US ownership. “Network 10 is in a real pickle and I don’t see a way out for them.” Parent company for sale Ten’s parent company Paramount has been preoccupied with ongoing merger and acquisition negotiations in the United States. As well as film studio Paramount Pictures, the company owns US network CBS, cable channels Nickelodeon and MTV, British broadcaster Channel 5, and Network 10 in Australia. It’s chaired by Shari Redstone, who has been making moves to sell her family’s controlling stake in the once-giant media company. Production company Skydance, founded by billionaire David Ellison who is the son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, had been in advanced talks to acquire the Redstone family’s shares. But according to reports, some powerful shareholders were dissatisfied with the offer, rumoured to be worth about $US3 billion ($A4.53 billion). On Friday, the exclusivity on merger talks with Skydance ceased, leaving Paramount open to discussions with other interested parties. There have reportedly been calls from major shareholders for the board to consider a rival bid from private equity firm Apollo Global and Sony Pictures, which has offered $US26 billion ($A39.26 billion) for a full acquisition of Paramount Global. Mediaweek publisher and long-time media commentator James Manning said Ten’s future remains up on the air. “Some think whoever the new Paramount owner turns out to be, they will be mainly interested in the studio business, the US CBS network, and the US cable channels,” Mr Manning wrote in a recent column. “Other assets might be sold off. Those could include the Paramount+ streaming business and the free streaming business Pluto TV in the US. International assets to be sold off could include Australia’s Network 10 and UK’s Channel 5.” He speculated that the most likely buyer of Ten would be a private equity firm enticed by a “bargain buy”. Prof Potter agreed, saying: “My feeling is that it’s probably not an asset worth holding.” Disappearing pot of gold Back in 2006, Australia’s three commercial networks enjoyed a share of $7.7 billion of advertising revenue, allowing them to both turn a profit and invest in quality television programming. Compare that to 2020-21 figures provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, and that huge pot of gold has more than halved to $3.8 billion. Television accounted for almost half of all ad spend across Australia in 2007, while now it equates to about 18 per cent. “The pot of ad money hasn’t increased, but the places companies can spend it has,” Prof Lotz said. “Too much money has come out of commercial TV. “We live in a very different world now and if we had two services, or maybe just even one that had enough money to have a full slate of programming that could gather a significant audience, that might be better for Australia.” Major losses of revenue have forced commercial networks to “cut back their content so much that people can’t find much they want to watch”, she said. “All that’s left is sports, news and reality. The idea that having three commercial players doing virtually the same thing is harder to justify.” Ten’s news offering has never been a serious rival to that of Seven and Nine and it is no longer a serious player in the live sports space. As well as the dominant streaming services, Prof Lotz said a whole range of media substitutes – like TikTok or Instagram – are captivating eyeballs that might’ve once turned to broadcast. Major streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime are also entering the advertising business, serving them up to subscribers on entry level tiers. “That’s only likely to make things worse for commercial TV operators,” Prof Lotz said. Signs of instability Locally, Ten has grappled with a series of internal changes. The exit of one of its two co-bosses, Jarrod Villani, earlier this year, left Beverley McGarvey, who was appointed the network’s president and Paramount’s regional lead for Australia and New Zealand, as the sole lead. It’s said the mood within the company’s Pyrmont headquarters has been subdued for some time, not helped by the unwelcome and messy distraction created by Bruce Lehrmann’s long defamation action. Ten successfully defended the suit but hardly came out unscathed, with the Federal Court criticising its handling of various matters related to the broadcast of The Project’s explosive interview with Brittany Higgins in 2021. Daily headlines about the court case overshadowed a series of big content plays, many of which failed to deliver a significant ratings recovery. Warner Brothers, producers of The Masked Singer, had been in discussions with Ten about renewing the celebrity singing guessing-game, which costs a fortune to make. The structure of the proposed deal included rights to The Bachelor and its various spin-offs, so in passing on The Masked Singer, it lost both. “That’s a really big hole in their schedule,” Prof Potter said. When approached for comment for this story early on Tuesday, a Network 10 spokesperson simply said the decision to axe The Bachelor and The Masked Singer was unrelated to Paramount Global’s ownership. “We regularly review our programming schedule and consider changes to meet industry and audience trends and is a normal part of our local business operations,” the spokesperson said. Following the publication of this story, the spokesperson sent an additional statement. “As a member of a global business, we are used to speculation about our company, but Paramount Australia is a strong diversified media and entertainment business spanning linear free-to-air TV, multi-channels, FAST channels, BVOD with 10 Play, SVOD with Paramount+ as well as consumer products, branded content, live events and more,” it read. “On free-to-air, our content slate has had strong results with 10 securing four of the top 10 shows of the year in the key advertising demographics of 25 to 54s and 16 to 39s with Australian Survivor, I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here!, Gogglebox and MasterChef Australia.  “Plus, these shows have all set new records in digital viewing on 10 Play. “In April, 10 Play had its biggest month ever off the back of strong results in 2023 as the fastest growing BVOD in Australia. And Paramount+ continues to be the fastest growing streaming service in the country since launching more than two years ago. “We’re confident of our position in the market and are looking forward to an equally strong second half of the year.” Selling ‘non-core assets’ Last week, Paramount Global chief executive Bob Bakish left the business after a rumoured falling-out with Ms Redstone and was replaced by not one, but three co-CEOs. “The office of the CEO is working with the board to develop a comprehensive, long-range plan to accelerate growth and develop popular content, materially streamline operations, strengthen the balance sheet, and continue to optimise the streaming strategy,” a statement read. An email sent to staff from the trio shortly after the news was announced flagged “challenging” days ahead. Pundits in the US believe that will almost certainly include job cuts, on top of the 800 global redundancies announced in February. Ten staff were set to be among those affected but no details were provided on how many. But Bloomberg reports the new CEOs are considering a range of measures on top of cost cuts and restructuring – the sale “of non-core assets” like its beleaguered Australian network. Last year, Ten suffered its worst ratings year ever recorded, with viewers abandoning the network in droves in favour of rivals Seven and Nine, as well as streaming services like Netflix. Its total audience share was about half that of the other two commercial broadcasters. It was even beaten by the ABC in third place, cementing Ten as the country’s fourth most-watched free-to-air network. On top of that, none of the 50 highest rating shows of 2023, in terms of total audience, were on Ten or its streaming and on-demand services. The global company’s premium streaming service Paramount+, which operates in Australia, is also rumoured to be likely to merge with NBC Universal’s platform Peacock. Paramount+ has lost billions of dollars globally since its launch in early 2021. Whatever happens, the uncertainty over Paramount’s future left a bad taste in the mouth of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who once owned 15 per cent of the company. Berkshire Hathaway, which Mr Buffett runs, offloaded its entire interest at his direction, he told shareholders at the weekend. “It was 100 per cent my decision, and we’ve sold it all, and we lost quite a bit of money,” he admitted. When it comes to just how big the loss was, financial analysts in America are throwing around figures in the vicinity of $US1.5 billion ($A2.26 billion). A month after crowd members reacted angrily to being tricked by a hidden camera show, a prominent Aussie journalist has opened up on the incident.

    "content": "Asian markets were mostly higher Tuesday after another day of gains on Wall Street, although Chinese shares faltered. U.S. futures and oil prices edged higher. Tokyo's Nikkei 225, reopening after a national holiday, jumped 1.5% to 38,784.91 and the Kospi in South Korea surged 1.9% to 2,728.05. Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.9% to 18,420.38 and the Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% lower, to 3,136.62. Data on travel, retail spending and home sales during the weeklong Golden Week holidays showed persisting weakness in the economy. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 advanced 0.7% to 7,739.00 ahead of a central bank decision on interest rates. Taiwan's Taiex was up 0.3%, while India's Sensex was nearly flat as the country began the third phase of its weeks' long national elections process. On Monday, the S&P 500 rose 1% to 5,180.74. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5% to 38,852.27, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.2% to 16,349.25. Tech stocks were at the forefront, with familiar ringleaders Nvidia and Super Micro Computer again pulling the market higher. They've had a couple hiccups recently, but a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology has Nvidia up 86.1% for the year so far after Monday's 3.8% gain. Super Micro is up 192.1% after its gain of 6.1%. Berkshire Hathaway added 1% after Warren Buffett's company reported its latest quarterly results over the weekend. It helped to offset a 9.7% slide for Spirit Airlines, which reported a slightly worse loss than expected. The carrier said it's facing increased competition in many of its markets, particularly between the United States and Latin America. Apple slipped 0.9% after Berkshire Hathaway revealed it had pared its stake in the tech giant. The U.S. stock market has been swinging since setting a record at the end of March. It sunk for weeks on fears that stubbornly high inflation would prevent or at least delay the Federal Reserve from delivering the cuts to interest rates that Wall Street craves. But markets found a burst of optimism at the end of last week following a cooler-than-expected jobs report. It suggested the U.S. economy could nail the tightrope walk of staying strong enough to avoid a bad recession, but not so firm that it puts too much upward pressure on inflation. Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle said he still expects two cuts to rates this year, in July and November, after Fed Chair Jerome Powell ''pushed back strongly against the possibility of further rate hikes'' at his press conference last week. This week is relatively quiet. The bulk of companies in the S&P 500 have already reported their results for the first three months of the year, with more than three-quarters topping profit expectations, according to FactSet. But several more big names are still on the way, including The Walt Disney Co. and Uber Technologies. In the bond market, which has been dictating much of the action in the stock market recently, Treasury yields held mostly steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.49%, from 4.50% late Friday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, was also relatively little changed. Traders are betting on a nearly 89% chance that the Fed will cut its main interest rate at least once before the end of the year, according to data from CME Group. That's up from from an 81.6% probability seen a week earlier. Lower rates would help ease the pressure on the economy and financial system. Corporate profit reports have been better than expected not just in the United States but also in Europe and Japan, according to strategists at Deutsche Bank. Global earnings growth is on track for a second straight quarter of growth following four consecutive declines. In other trading, benchmark U.S. crude oil added 24 cents to $78.72 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gained 37 cents on Monday. Brent crude, the international standard, was also up 24 cents at $83.57 per barrel. The dollar rose to 154.49 Japanese yen from 153.90 yen. The euro was nearly unchanged at $1.0769. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed. © 2024 StarTribune. All rights reserved."

Στον δείκτη MSCI Greece Standard Index το ενδιαφέρον πλέον επικεντρώνεται στη µετοχή των ΕΛΠΕ Tο βράδυ της επόµενης Τρίτης 14 Μαΐου 2024 αναµένονται οι ανακοινώσεις για την παγκόσµια αναδιάρθρωση των δεικτών του MSCI της τριµηνιαίας αναθεώρησης. Στον δείκτη MSCI Greece Standard Index το ενδιαφέρον πλέον επικεντρώνεται στη µετοχή των ΕΛΠΕ, καθώς φαίνεται να καλύπτει το όριο της συνολικής κεφαλαιοποίησης, ωστόσο απέχει πολύ από το όριο της σταθµισµένης κεφαλαιοποίησης. Οι ενδεχόµενες αλλαγές θα εφαρµοστούν την 3η Ιουνίου 2024, µε τους επενδυτές να λαµβάνουν τις θέσεις τους µία µέρα νωρίτερα. Οι αναθεωρήσεις των δεικτών MSCI έχουν γίνει τριµηνιαίες και αναδιαρθρώνονται οι δείκτες εξ ολοκλήρου, όπως ήταν οι παλαιές εξαµηνιαίες. Σύµφωνα µε τα στοιχεία του οίκου MSCI, τον Φεβρουάριο του 2024 το εύρος της συνολικής κεφαλαιοποίησης που θα έπρεπε να έχει µια εταιρεία για την εισαγωγή της στον δείκτη Standard Index (για τις αναδυόµενες αγορές) κυµαινόταν µεταξύ 2,42 δισ. δολ. και 5,56 δισ. δολ., ενώ το Νοέµβριο του 2023 το αντίστοιχο εύρος της κεφαλαιοποίησης ήταν 2,18 δισ. δολ. έως 5,01 δισ. δολ. ∆εν θα αργήσει να γίνει γνωστό το µέρισµα που ο SSM θα επιτρέψει να διανείµουν οι τράπεζες. Η Εθνική πάντως έχει κάνει πρόβλεψη ποσοστού 30% για τα κέρδη του 2023. Σε ό,τι αφορά τα δάνεια µε εγγύηση του Ελληνικού ∆ηµοσίου που αποτελούν NPEs, η τράπεζα έχει ήδη πάρει προβλέψεις 100 εκατ. ευρώ. ∆ηλώνει ωστόσο αισιοδοξία για την ανάκτησή τους. Aντίο Βόννη. Υπέρ της πλήρους µετεγκατάστασης των οµοσπονδιακών υπουργείων και των υπηρεσιών τους από τη Βόννη στο Βερολίνο τάσσεται η πλειοψηφία των Γερµανών, προκειµένου να περιοριστεί το κόστος λειτουργίας τους. Σύµφωνα µε έρευνα του Ινστιτούτου YouGov για λογαριασµό του Γερµανικού Πρακτορείου Τύπου dpa, το 53% των ερωτηθέντων θα ήθελε να δει τις κυβερνητικές υπηρεσίες να µετακοµίζουν στο Βερολίνο. Μόνο το 25% διαφωνεί µε την ιδέα, ενώ το 22% δεν εξέφρασε γνώµη. Σήµερα, έξι από τα 14 οµοσπονδιακά υπουργεία εξακολουθούν να διατηρούν την έδρα τους στη Βόννη. «Ελπίζω να έρθω του χρόνου». Με τη δήλωση αυτή ο Γουόρεν Μπάφετ προσπάθησε να διασκεδάσει τις ανησυχίες των επενδυτών της Berkshire Hathaway στη διάρκεια της ετήσιας συνέλευσης.  Ο Μπάφετ διαβεβαίωσε τους επενδυτές πως το σχέδιο για την επόµενη µέρα είναι έτοιµο και αποκάλυψε πως για πρώτη φορά ο Γκρεγκ Έιµπελ -ο διάδοχός του- θα λαµβάνει τις τελικές επενδυτικές αποφάσεις της εταιρείας.

Ένα ερώτημα, που αντίστοιχα απασχόλησε τους οικονομολόγους, όταν ξεκίνησε η εκβιομηχάνιση  Επιμέλεια: Κατερίνα Άτση • [email protected] Ο Γουόρεν Μπάφετ είναι ο πρώτος που παραδέχεται ότι δεν γνωρίζει πολλά για την τεχνητή νοημοσύνη. Αυτό συνάδει με τη μακροχρόνια φιλοσοφία του να αποφεύγει την τεχνολογία που θεωρεί ότι είναι πέρα από τις δυνατότητές του. Και το τεράστιο μερίδιό του στην Apple – το οποίο ωστόσο μειώθηκε πριν τρεις μήνες- προέκυψε περισσότερο ως έμπνευση που σχετίζεται με την καταναλωτική της επιτυχία, παρά ως τεχνολογικό στοίχημα, όπως δήλωσε ο ίδιος το Σαββατοκύριακο, στην ετήσια συνάντηση της Berkshire Hathaway. Ωστόσο, ο δισεκατομμυριούχος επενδυτής και διευθύνων σύμβουλος και πρόεδρος της Berkshire δεν μπόρεσε να αποφύγει την συζήτηση για το θέμα, καθώς παραμένει ζήτημα που απασχολεί τους μετόχους. Χαρακτηρίζοντας την τεχνητή νοημοσύνη ριζοσπαστική, ο Μπάφετ την παρομοίασε με ένα «τζίνι» που «μόλις βγει από το μπουκάλι, ίσως έχει καταστροφικές συνέπειες» «Θυμίζει την αυγή των πυρηνικών όπλων και των απρόβλεπτων συνεπειών τους, και μεταξύ των βαθιών ερωτημάτων που εγείρει είναι το τι θα συμβεί με την εργασία και τον ελεύθερο χρόνο που θα προκύψει» ανέφερε. Εκεί που εστίασε ο Μπάφετ, σχετικά με τον αντίκτυπό της AI είναι το ερώτημα, που «κανείς δεν μπορεί να απαντήσει» με σιγουριά «Μπορεί να δημιουργήσει μια τεράστια ποσότητα ελεύθερου χρόνου. Και τι θα κάνει ο κόσμος με τόσο ελεύθερο χρόνο;», αναρωτήθηκε, συνδέοντάς το θέμα με το πώς θα λυθούν τα προβλήματα της παραγωγικότητας (ένας χρόνιος πονοκέφαλος για τους οικονομολόγους) που θα προκύψουν. Η τεχνητή νοημοσύνη αναμένεται να αποτελέσει έναν σημαντικό παράγοντα αύξησης της παραγωγικότητας της εργασίας. Ο αντιπρόεδρος της IBM και πρώην επικεφαλής του Εθνικού Οικονομικού Συμβουλίου Gary Cohn δήλωσε στο CNBC την περασμένη εβδομάδα ότι η υιοθέτηση της AI γίνεται γρήγορα και η αύξηση της παραγωγικότητας επίσης συμβαίνει, αν και αργά. «Πρόκειται για μια εξέλιξη που θα τροφοδοτήσει αργά την οικονομία», δήλωσε ο Cohn, για να προσθέσει: «Δεν νομίζω ότι έχουμε δει την πραγματική ώθηση της παραγωγικότητας χάρη στην τεχνητή νοημοσύνη». Πολλές εταιρείες υποστηρίζουν  ότι η τεχνητή νοημοσύνη δεν θα αντικαταστήσει τις θέσεις εργασίας, αλλά θα επιτρέψει στους εργαζόμενους να επικεντρωθούν σε δεξιότητες και καθήκοντα υψηλότερης αξίας, μεταφέροντας  στις μηχανές εργασίες που δεν αρέσουν στους ανθρώπους ούτως ή άλλως. Ωστόσο, περίπου το 37% των επικεφαλής επιχειρήσεων που συμμετείχαν σε έρευνα του Resume Builder ανέφεραν ότι η τεχνολογία αντικατέστησε τους εργαζομένους το 2023,  με το 44% να δηλώνει ότι φέτος θα ακολουθήσουν περισσότερες απολύσεις. Βέβαια οι τεχνολογικές εξελίξεις, ιστορικά- όπως η αύξηση της εκβιομηχάνισης – δεν αποδείχθηκαν  δολοφόνοι της εργασίας. Αλλά, λόγω της πιθανής έλλειψης ευκαιριών εργασίας με την ανάπτυξη της τεχνητής νοημοσύνης, ήδη ορισμένοι εμπειρογνώμονες, καθώς και δισεκατομμυριούχοι και πολιτικοί, έχουν εκφράσει την ανάγκη για ένα καθολικό βασικό εισόδημα προκειμένου να συμπληρωθούν χαμηλότεροι ή καθόλου μισθοί και να διατηρηθεί η οικονομία στη ζωή. Με αυτές τις ανησυχίες και τα αναπάντητα ερωτήματα στο μυαλό του, ο Μπάφετ δήλωσε ότι οι εταιρείες που απαιτούν ανθρώπινη εργασία, όπως η Berkshire Hathaway, πρέπει να αναζητήσουν την ισορροπία μεταξύ του τρόπου με τον οποίο η τεχνολογία μπορεί να τις βοηθήσει να γίνουν πιο αποτελεσματικές χωρίς να θέσουν σε κίνδυνο τους ανθρώπους. «Δεν ξέρω πώς θα βεβαιωθώ ότι αυτό θα συμβεί, όπως δεν ξέρω αν είμαι σίγουρος πως όταν χρησιμοποιήσαμε δύο ατομικές βόμβες στον Β’ Παγκόσμιο Πόλεμο, δεν γνωρίζαμε ότι είχαμε δημιουργήσει κάτι που θα μπορούσε να καταστρέψει τον κόσμο αργότερα», κατέληξε ο Μπάφετ.

    "description": "A inteligência artificial no sistema financeiro, na política, na agricultura e na sua casa são alguns dos destaques desta newsletter. Confira!",
    "published_at": "2024-05-08T20:15:47Z",
    "content": "Em alta   08/05/2024 17h15    Atualizado  08/05/2024       O cenário internacional se sobressaiu nos últimos dias com as discussões sobre a inteligência artificial (IA).   A China continua a polarizar com os Estados Unidos, enquanto suas startups avançam e lutam para serem as próximas “OpenAI”.   Interessante também são os comentários do megainvestidor Warren Buffett. Referindo-se à IA, ele diz que o mundo ainda se arrependerá por ter deixado “o gênio sair da garrafa”.   Essa advertência já havia sido feita antes por outros protagonistas. Mas, de fato, é inócuo questionar agora se a sociedade deveria ter dado “corda” para a IA.   A tecnologia já conquistou seu espaço e é inimaginável pensar em uma infinidade de aplicações sem o algoritmo. O que precisa agora é acelerar a regulamentação do uso da tecnologia, governança e ética. Enfim, dizer ao “gênio” quais são os seus limites.   Veja outras reportagens que também são destaque na newsletter de inteligência artificial:  Musk tornou a Tesla uma ‘ação meme’Com Trump concorrendo à Casa Branca, China prevê mais turbulênciaQuais são os limites da IA no sistema financeiro?Como a tecnologia está transformando o papel do diretor financeiroÉ na Ucrânia que nasce a primeira 'porta-voz' avatar de governoA incursão dos robôs com IA na agriculturaSamsung entra na era das TVs com IA Avatares de Buffett e do governo ucraniano: fraude de um lado, ajuda de outro  O megainvestidor Warren Buffett, diretor-executivo da Berkshire Hathaway, contou como foi a experiência de ver sua imagem e voz manipuladas.   Buffett reconhece que a inteligência artificial move uma indústria que responderá pelo maior crescimento de todos os tempos.   Mas ele olha com desconfiança para a tecnologia. Em sua opinião, talvez a humanidade se arrependa um dia de ter deixado 'o gênio sair da garrafa'. Veja o que ele diz sobre o avatar que manipulou sua voz e imagem.   Por outro lado, o próprio governo da Ucrânia criou um avatar com inteligência artificial para desempenhar o papel de 'porta-voz' oficial.   Verifique o porquê da iniciativa que fez emergir Victoria Shi e quem cedeu imagem e voz para o robô.  Entenda por que Musk tornou a Tesla uma ‘ação meme’ e outras pegadas da IA no sistema financeiro  Bradford DeLong, professor de economia na Universidade da Califórnia (Berkeley), faz uma análise do crescimento da fortuna de Elon Musk e da valorização da Tesla, a fabricante de carros elétricos do empresário.   O professor relembra os negócios pelos quais Musk navegou, passando de um tema para outro, de trens de energia elétrica a robôs humaniformes, inteligência artificial e supercomputador com IA.   Confira por que DeLong conclui que Musk mais prometeu do que realizou e, por conseguinte, acabou se tornando “um arruaceiro vendendo ações meme\".   O sistema financeiro é foco também de análise pelo advogado Jairo Saddi. Ele avalia os contornos e limites da IA nos bancos.   Para Saddi, alguns pontos chamam a atenção da tecnologia no sistema financeiro: privacidade e segurança cibernética; operações de crédito; Open Finance; produtividade e demanda por empregos. Leia aqui a análise completa.   Ainda no setor de finanças, a consultoria Accenture fez uma pesquisa para espelhar o impacto na área financeira das organizações com a chegada da IA.   Uma das conclusões é que 69% das atividades de finanças serão afetadas pelas novas tecnologias.   Observe na pesquisa como a inteligência artificial vai transformar o cargo de diretor financeiro (CFO).   Outro estudo teve como foco a área do Direito. Um levantamento feito pela Fundação Getulio Vargas a pedido do Conselho Federal da Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil mostra a realidade da profissão de advogado.   Além dos anos de estudo para se graduar e agora também precisar saber trabalhar com a IA, a remuneração é considerada baixa para a maioria dos advogados, que ganha até R$ 6,6 mil.   Confira quais são os maiores salários desse profissional.  O que robô e IA têm a ver com ervas daninhas?  O potencial para uso da inteligência artificial no agronegócio é imenso. Observe alguns destaques trazidos pelas publicações “Época Negócios” e “Globo Rural”.   Em Cruz Alta (SP), a Tereos e a Solinftec desenvolveram uma tecnologia para combater ervas daninhas na plantação de cana-de-açúcar. Um robô com IA identifica as espécies invasoras e aplica defensivos agrícolas na dose necessária. O uso do produto caiu pela metade.   Pesquisa realizada por cientistas dos Emirados Árabes Unidos e do Reino Unido mostra os avanços da integração entre materiais eletricamente ativos e plantas. No futuro, as plantas eletrônicas serão uma realidade adotada em larga escala.  A TV no comando da casa conectada  A nova linha de televisores conectados da Samsung traz a inteligência artificial a bordo.   Com isso, além de prometer mais resolução, o aparelho dispõe de outros recursos. É capaz de controlar alguns itens da casa e fazer ajustes de imagem e som automaticamente.

    "description": "Warren Buffett’s $8 billion profit from bets on five Japanese trading houses is generating something of a virtuous cycle across Asia.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-08T15:37:41Z",
    "content": "Warren Buffett Warren Buffett’s $8 billion profit from bets on five Japanese trading houses is generating something of a virtuous cycle across Asia. Granted, the Berkshire Hathaway billionaire’s windfall from stakes in Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo is an “on paper” one. Yet these unrealized wins have chieftains in India perking up in ways that could help Asia’s third-biggest economy raise its corporate game. And, indirectly, prod South Korea to step up efforts to internationalize corporate practices. The India plot thickened on Friday when Buffett gave Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economy a timely shoutout. The Indian market, Buffett said, has “unexplored” opportunities. He added that “I’m sure there are loads of opportunities in countries like India.” Not the most expansive take. But you could easily replace the word “India” today with “Japan” in 2020, when Buffett surprised the investment world by disclosing sizable stakes in Japanese companies. It’s hard to exaggerate the broader impact of the globe’s most famous value investor betting on a deflation-plagued, aging nation. And on five “old economy” conglomerates that time had largely forgotten. But talk about a prescient wager, one that presaged the Nikkei’s 225 Stock Average topping its previous 1989 highs earlier this year. Buffett didn’t precipitate the rally. That credit goes to the Bank of Japan’s negative-rate policies, an ultra-weak yen and moves by lawmakers to strengthen corporate governance. Yet the “Buffett effect” will have India-curious investments mulling their own opportunities in Modi’s economy. And Modi, in turn, looking at the Japan playbook for corporate upgrades. South Korea, in the meantime, has been racing to emulate the FOMO dynamic lifting Japan’s stock market over the last 18 months. This fear-of-missing-out energy lit a fire under President Yoon Suk Yeol’s administration. In February, Yoon’s Financial Services Commission rolled out a “Corporate Value-Up Program” to prod Korea Inc. to increase efficiency, diversify boardrooms and boost shareholder returns. Though Yoon didn’t name-check Tokyo, envy over Japan’s return to “It” market status was written between the lines in large, bold font. The announcement came, after all, at the same moment the Nikkei surge was putting Japan’s economy in global headlines for all the right reasons. Also in the subtext was news in February that Buffett-owned IMC Group is building a semiconductor materials facility in Daegu, South Korea. Though worth only $98 million, it’s a solid start as Asia’s No. 4 economy seeks to lure more investments from Buffett and his ilk. To be sure, one shouldn’t overstate the influence of one man as Asia works to reduce bureaucracy, strengthen capital markets, increase innovation and internationalize corporate practices. But nor should we downplay the power of the “Good Housekeeping” seal that investments like Buffett’s can impart. Yoon is but the latest leader since the late 1990s promising to end the dreaded “Korea discount,” which depresses the valuation of Kospi Index companies relative to regional peers. And two years into his five-year term, investors have every reason to worry that Yoon won’t fix the problem either. His value-up scheme, unfortunately, is light on specifics or a clear timeline. Reform is needed if South Korea is going to pull more Buffett-like investment whales its way. Ditto for India, which is finding it harder to lure global capital than a year ago. Doing so was almost too easy in 2023, a year in which the Nifty 50 surged 20% and the S&P BSE Sensex Index rose 19%. Credit where it’s due: some of those gains reflect Modi’s pro-business policies and India growing a China-beating 7.5% last year. Yet lots of those capital inflows came from international funds fleeing a cratering Chinese market. Between a 2021 peak and January 2024, plunging mainland shares lost $7 trillion of market value. Japan, India and Taiwan were major beneficiaries of China’s epic selloff. Now, as Shanghai and Shenzhen companies return to favor, India, like Japan and Taiwan, is having to work harder to win its share of global investments. All the more reason for Modi to accelerate efforts to open the economy, curb red tape, reduce inequality and take Buffett up on his India optimism. That goes, too, for Japan. Just about everything Tokyo policymakers expected of 2024 is going awry. China’s economy isn’t bouncing back as hoped. The Federal Reserve won’t be slashing rates as expected. Global inflation isn’t as transitory as officials thought. Japan’s weak recovery is confounding the optimistic takes of just a few months ago. Nor is the BOJ accelerating moves to normalize rates, as was universally predicted. And Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s approval rating is in the mid-20s, at best, as inflation rises faster than wages. What’s going right, though, is a Nikkei market up 14.5% so far this year. In recent interactions with shareholders, Buffett made it clear Berkshire Hathaway is open to additional Japan bets, to grow his $8 billion profit. Don’t underestimate how the mere specter of such investors is catalyzing change in boardrooms in Japan and beyond — and in game-changing ways. "

Il servizio è dedicato agli utenti registrati. Trovi tutti gli articoli salvati nella tua area personale nella sezione preferiti e sull'app Corriere News. «Wall Street è l’unico luogo in cui chi arriva in Rolls-Royce chiede consiglio a chi arriva in metropolitana». Per descrivere Warren Buffett, il più celebre investitore al mondo, forse conviene partire da questa sua affermazione. Ricorrente. Una sorta di mantra personale. L’«oracolo di Omaha», diretta emanazione del suo fondo hedge Berkshire Hathaway, è conosciuto per aver quasi sempre indovinato le scelte finanziarie. A Wall Street viene reputato il mostro sacro del trading azionario.    \n\n\n\n La leggenda narra che abbia cominciato ad investire i suoi piccoli risparmi gia a 14 anni. Quando affittò a dei pastori un piccolo terreno di famiglia nel suo Nebraska ricavandone un rendimento costante. Dopo la laurea in Economia e un master alla Columbia (e non ad Harvard che rifiutò la sua candidatura, salvo ricredersi dopo) comincia a lavorare a New York per il primo hedge fund della storia, il fondo Graham, di cui rifiuta di diventare partner quando il capostipite va in pensione. Torna nel suo Nebraska e decide di fondare la Buffett Partnership, un fondo d’investimento con il quale applica le strategie d’investimento insegnate da Benjamin Graham, dette del value investing, cioè la ricerca di titoli sottovalutati da comprare e tenere per lunghissimi periodi. Attraverso questa modalità, Buffett acquisisce partecipazioni in colossi come Coca Cola, Gillette, McDonald’s, Kirby Company e Walt Disney. Successivamente, decide di quotare in borsa la Buffett Partnership fondendola con una società tessile quotata, la Berkshire Hathaway. \n                    \n                    \n                di  Daniela Polizzi \n\n Negli anni ha acquisito una rendita di credibilità talmente privilegiata da averlo convertito in un benchmark. A suo nome è nato persino un indicatore che orienta le scelte di investimento in Borsa a seconda di come Buffett ritiene stia cambiando il vento. Si tratta di un algoritmo che valuta le performance borsistiche legandole però al Pil degli Stati Uniti, quindi individuandone un punto di caduta industriale. Fu uno dei pochi, Warren, a prevedere seppur non con quella portata il crollo del 2008 abbandonando progressivamente i titoli bancari prima del tracollo della Lehman Brothers. E’ conosciuto per le sue attività filantropiche. Finanzia in maniera cospicua la fondazione del suo amico Bill Gates. In questi giorni è stata l'assemblea annuale degli azionisti di Berkshire Hathaway a rubare la scena con una mossa significativa. La holding guidata da Warren Buffett ha ridotto la sua partecipazione in Apple del 13%, passando da 905 milioni di azioni alla fine del 2023 a 790 milioni.

Tuttavia, la crescita dei prodotti sembra essere in difficoltà rispetto ai servizi, rimanendo all'ombra di questi ultimi.La giornata si apre con uno scivolone per Palantir, il cui titolo scambia dell'-8% nel mercato after-hours. Palantir Technologies è tra i principali beneficiari dell'ondata di spesa per l'intelligenza artificiale, registrando un guadagno in borsa superiore al 46% dall'inizio dell'anno e del 240% negli ultimi 12 mesi, gli investitori si aspettavano risultati stellari, soprattutto a causa dei dubbi legati alla valutazione dell'azienda», spiega Gabriel Debach, Italian market analyst di eToro. Nonostante Palantir abbia registrato un incremento dei ricavi del 21% e un aumento degli utili del 454% rispetto all'anno precedente, il mercato ha reagito negativamente a una guida più debole del previsto.

Wręcz przeciwnie. - Buffett przez wiele kwartałów będzie zachowywał ostrożność w dokonywaniu nowych zakupów - pisze Grzegorz Dróżdż. Warren Buffett, znany również jako \"Wyrocznia z Omaha\", jest jednym z najbardziej wpływowych inwestorów na świecie. Jego decyzje inwestycyjne są bacznie obserwowane przez rynki finansowe, a jego opinie na temat przyszłości gospodarki są szeroko komentowane. Podczas ostatniego walnego zgromadzenia akcjonariuszy Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett podzielił się swoimi przemyśleniami na temat obecnych i przyszłych inwestycji oraz perspektyw na nadchodzące lata.  Dalsza część artykułu pod materiałem wideo Jak zauważa Grzegorz Dróżdż, analityk Conotoxia Ltd. (Invest.Cinkciarz.pl), aż 16,8 proc. portfela inwestycyjnego Buffetta stanowią gotówka, jej ekwiwalenty oraz krótkoterminowe papiery wartościowe. Stan środków pieniężnych Berkshire osiągnął rekordową kwotę 188,99 miliardów dolarów, w porównaniu do 167,6 mld w czwartym kwartale ubiegłego roku. Buffett zdradził, że każdego poniedziałku kupuje 3-miesięczne i 6-miesięczne bony skarbowe, a ilość posiadanej gotówki i krótkoterminowych bonów skarbowych przez Berkshire Hathaway rośnie niemal nieprzerwanie od wielu lat, jak wskazuje Dróżdż.  Buffett, cytowany przez eksperta, wskazał na jeszcze jeden problem. \"Nasze saldo środków pieniężnych i bonów skarbowych na koniec kwartału wyniosło 182 miliardy dolarów. Można założyć, że na koniec tego kwartału prawdopodobnie wyniosą około 200 mld dol. Chcielibyśmy je wydać, ale nie wydamy, chyba że uznamy, że robią coś, co wiąże się z niewielkim ryzykiem i może przynieść nam dużo pieniędzy\", jak przytacza Grzegorz Dróżdż. Zmiany w portfelu inwestycyjnym Berkshire Hathaway  Analityk Conotoxia Ltd. zwraca uwagę, że Berkshire Hathaway po raz kolejny zmniejszyło swój udział w Apple. Obecnie wartość ich udziałów w tej spółce wynosi ok. 135,4 mld USD, co oznacza 13-proc. spadek inwestycji. Decyzja Buffetta o sprzedaży zaskoczyła wielu, biorąc pod uwagę jego entuzjazm dla firmy, którą nazywał swoją drugą najważniejszą spółką po grupie ubezpieczeniowej Berkshire. Buffett przyznał, że poprzednia redukcja udziałów w Apple z 2020 roku mogła być błędem, a ostatnie cięcia były motywowane względami podatkowymi, nie zaś negatywną oceną przyszłych perspektyw akcji, jak pisze Dróżdż.  Ponadto, Warren Buffett poinformował, że Berkshire Hathaway sprzedało wszystkie swoje udziały w gigancie medialnym i rozrywkowym Paramount Global, ponosząc przy tym znaczne straty. \"To była w 100 proc. moja decyzja. Sprzedaliśmy wszystko i straciliśmy sporo pieniędzy,\" powiedział Buffett, dodając, że ta sytuacja skłoniła go do przemyśleń na temat priorytetów ludzi w czasie wolnym, jak zauważa analityk.  W rozważaniach o przyszłości Buffett stwierdził, że choć energia odnawialna budzi jego zainteresowanie, rozwój w tej branży wymaga czasu. \"Wyrocznia z Omaha\" porównał sytuację do niemożności przyspieszenia ciąży przez zapłodnienie dziewięciu kobiet jednocześnie. Jednakże systemy słoneczne prawdopodobnie nigdy nie będą jedynym źródłem energii elektrycznej - wskazuje Grzegorz Dróżdż. Buffett zajął się również kwestią przyszłości Berkshire po jego odejściu, zaznaczając, że pomimo swojego zaawansowanego wieku (w sierpniu skończy 94 lata), nadal czuje się zdolny do pracy. Wskazał Grega Abela jako swojego następcę na stanowisku dyrektora generalnego, zastanawiając się, jak będą wyglądały decyzje inwestycyjne Berkshire po jego odejściu, pisze analityk.  Odnosząc się do możliwości wypłaty pierwszej dywidendy przez Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett wyraził przekonanie, że preferowane jest wykorzystanie kapitału w bardziej dochodowy sposób niż wypłata dywidend. Potwierdził, że wybór metody zwrotu kapitału akcjonariuszom leży w gestii dyrektora generalnego, jak zauważa Dróżdż.  Wygląda na to, że znów znajdujemy się w sytuacji, w której Buffett przez wiele kwartałów będzie zachowywał ostrożność w dokonywaniu nowych zakupów. To zapewne przełoży się na rosnący udział gotówki w posiadanych kapitałach - podsumował.  © 2024 WIRTUALNA POLSKA MEDIA S.A."

    "content": "HMM: Warren Buffett’s $56 Billion Silent Warning to Wall Street May Portend Trouble for Stocks. Although Warren Buffett has consistently shied away from offering negative takes on the U.S. economy and/or stock market during his nearly six-decade tenure as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, $56 billion of net-equity security sales over an 18-month stretch speaks volumes without the Oracle of Omaha having to say a word. The culprit for this consistent net-selling activity looks to be a historically pricey stock market and the irrational behavior of some of its participants. In Buffett’s annual letter to shareholders that was released in February, he had this to say about the “casino-like behavior” he wants no part of: “Though the stock market is massively larger than it was in our early years, today’s active participants are neither more emotionally stable nor better taught than I was in school. For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behaviors than they did when I was young. The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants.” At the end of the day, Warren Buffett and his team want a fair deal on a great business, and they aren’t willing to waiver from this ideal. As the S&P 500’s Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio shows, there simply aren’t many good deals at the moment. There’s nothing wrong with buying into a bubble, provided you know when to get out.

    "content": "Sztuczna inteligencja (AI) stopniowo integruje się z życiem ludzi na całym świecie. Na jej temat wypowiedział się ostatnio znany miliarder Warren Buffett. I nie była to pochlebna wypowiedź, porównał on ją bowiem do wynalezienia bomby atomowej. Podkreślił także, że jej używanie może wiązać się z poważnym ryzykiem. AI znajduje zastosowanie w wielu sektorach – od medycyny po transport. Wpływa ona także w coraz większym stopniu na metody pracy, nauki i komunikacji. Ta dynamicznie rozwijająca się technologia oferuje jednak nie tylko nowe możliwości, ale również stawia przed nami nowe wyzwania. Podczas zebrania akcjonariuszy Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett zwrócił uwagę na potencjalne zagrożenia wynikające z użycia sztucznej inteligencji. Miliarder wskazał, że AI może zostać wykorzystana przy bardzo wyrafinowanych oszustwach. Buffett stwierdził, że choć oszustwa nie są nowością na amerykańskiej scenie, to sztuczna inteligencja może uczynić z nich sektor rozwinięty znacznie bardziej niż kiedykolwiek wcześniej. Dodał jednak, że AI ma w sobie także pozytywny potencjał. Przyznał też, że nie rozumie działania tej technologii, w efekcie czego trudno przewidzieć mu czy jej skutki okażą się ostatecznie dobroczynne, czy szkodliwe. Buffett stwierdził, że sytuacja z AI ma się analogicznie do rozwoju technologii jądrowej, która również była wykorzystywana do potwornych celów. Dodał też, choć nie ma dużego pojęcia o sztucznej inteligencji, to jest przerażony potencjałem, który może ona za sobą nieść. W swojej wypowiedzi do opisania technologii użył metafory dżina w butelce, który kiedy zostanie raz wypuszczony, może być trudny do zamknięcia z powrotem. Wskazał tym samym, jak dużym wyzwaniem może okazać się kontrolowanie rozwoju AI. Technologii, która już zaczęła wpływać na nasze życie i może w znaczący sposób zmienić przyszłość społeczeństwa. Buffett jest znany ze swojego ostrożnego podejścia do technologii. Jego sceptycyzm wydaje się jednak zrozumiały, kiedy weźmie się pod uwagę, że w przeszłości cyberprzestępcy wykorzystali jego wizerunek, aby promować fałszywe inwestycje. Co ciekawe jest to często powtarzany schemat oszustwa, którego ofiarami padli również polscy politycy. "

Mas foi apenas visitando pessoalmente Omaha – a cidade natal do megainvestidor americano, no estado americano de Nebraska – que pude captar a verdadeira dimensão de seu legado. Foi lá, onde Buffett ergueu um império avaliado em mais de US$ 860 bilhões, que ocorreu no sábado (4) a conferência anual da Berkshire Hathaway – ou o “Woodstock capitalista”, para os íntimos. Nova York, berço de Wall Street, é um lugar pulsante, iluminado por anúncios e repleto de diversidade, onde o ritmo acelerado é a norma. Minha experiência na Faria Lima ensinou que ambientes assim, com muitos ruídos, boatos e um excesso de informação, podem ofuscar o que realmente importa para uma boa decisão de investimento. Buffett, por sua vez, escolheu o isolamento da pacata Omaha para viver e trabalhar, o que beneficiou significativamente sua capacidade de se concentrar no essencial. A pandemia demonstrou que é viável trabalhar remotamente. Mas imagine adotar esse modelo antes da década de 1980, quando as informações circulavam lentamente. O isolamento foi uma vantagem estratégica para Warren Buffett, permitindo que ele se focasse exclusivamente em suas análises e convicções. É essa, então, a fórmula do sucesso? Continua depois da publicidade Provavelmente, não. Buffett é um caso à parte, com uma forte convicção no “compounding” — o processo de acumulação de rendimentos sobre rendimentos, que possibilita o crescimento exponencial do investimento a longo prazo. É quase um princípio de vida para ele, que costuma perguntar: se você pudesse ter apenas um carro durante toda a vida, como o trataria? Com o máximo cuidado, certamente. O mesmo se aplica ao cuidado com nossa mente e corpo e à maneira como acumulamos não apenas riqueza, mas também conhecimento ao longo dos anos. A estratégia de compounding nem sempre beneficiou Warren Buffett. Sua primeira esposa, Susan, o deixou por discordar de sua política de retenção de capital sem realizar doações significativas para a sociedade. Buffett defendia que poderia gerar um impacto maior no futuro se continuasse a acumular recursos sob sua gestão.  A visão de Susan encontra eco entre muitos habitantes de Omaha. Em conversas com os locais, percebi a admiração por sua filha Susie, conhecida por um forte engajamento em causas sociais na comunidade. A reflexão necessária é: seria possível para Susie contribuir de maneira tão significativa sem o legado financeiro construído por seu pai? Continua depois da publicidade Buffett é conhecido por hábitos modestos, que mantém até hoje. Ele mora na casa de número 5.505 na Farnam Street. É uma residência grande e bonita – mas poderia ser infinitas vezes maior, se o megainvestidor quisesse. Adquirida em 1958 por US$ 31,5 mil, seu valor ajustado pela inflação seria em torno de US$ 340 mil. Colocada à venda, no entanto, certamente alcançaria uma cifra bem maior devido à valorização imobiliária ao longo dos anos e seu valor histórico no universo dos investimentos. O bairro é tranquilo e arborizado, com casas que tradicionalmente não têm portões — um traço comum no interior dos EUA. Entretanto, devido ao intenso assédio durante as semanas dos eventos, Buffett decidiu instalar um portão em sua propriedade. Apenas cinco minutos de descida pela Farnam Street levam ao McDonald’s da Dodge Street, uma parada regular de Buffett há décadas para o café da manhã. O bilionário, apesar da fortuna estimada em US$ 132 bilhões, tem seus pedidos matinais bem definidos conforme o desempenho do mercado. Em dias baixa, ele opta pela escolha mais econômica, os sausage patties, que custam US$ 2,61. Se o mercado está estável, ele prefere o sausage McMuffin with egg, por US$ 2,95. Já em dias de alta, escolhe o bacon, egg & cheese biscuit por US$ 3,17. Continua depois da publicidade Mais dois minutos de carro e Buffett chega ao número 3.555 da mesma rua, onde fica o escritório da Berkshire Hathaway. Apesar do vasto império financeiro que coordena, a empresa emprega apenas 25 funcionários diretamente. O edifício, conhecido como Blackstone Plaza, tem 16 andares e foi recentemente reformado e pintado todo de preto. Apesar das modernizações, não se compara aos imponentes arranha-céus de Wall Street ou da Faria Lima. Construído entre 1960 e 1961, o edifício que abriga o escritório da companhia desde 1962 é um marco discreto na paisagem de Omaha. Situado em uma das áreas mais movimentadas da cidade, com alguns hotéis, bares e escritórios, raramente há mais de 20 pessoas caminhando pela rua. Como a semana movimenta os bastidores, enquanto gravava em frente ao prédio, vi Guy Spier – renomado gestor do fundo Aquamarine, que atualmente tem 22% de seu portfólio investido na Berkshire – entrando no edifício. Continua depois da publicidade Omaha é uma cidade onde ter um carro é essencial, porque tudo fica distante de tudo. Um bom exemplo é o Gorat’s Steakhouse, restaurante favorito de Buffett. A viagem do escritório da Berkshire até lá leva 7 minutos de carro – ou 50 minutos a pé. Quando estive lá, o lugar estava repleto de turistas animados pelo evento. Frequentemente, os clientes solicitavam à garçonete que trouxesse o totem de Buffett para tirar fotos nas mesas. Conhecido pelas carnes de excelente qualidade, o Gorat’s tem seu preço – não espere gastar menos de US$ 45 apenas pelo prato principal. Na semana do evento, Omaha se transforma, com uma série de encontros e conferências secundárias. Os investidores, que demonstraram interesse através do envio de cartas à empresa nos meses anteriores, podem obter até quatro ingressos cada. Completado o processo de credenciamento e passada a rigorosa segurança, os participantes ganham acesso ao espaço de exposições do CHI Health Center. Continua depois da publicidade É comum que muitos resumam a Berkshire Hathaway aos investimentos emblemáticos em empresas como Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, além de grandes reservas de caixa e títulos do tesouro. De fato, esses ativos são fundamentais para os resultados. No entanto, a companhia aproveita o momento para demonstrar seu envolvimento com uma diversidade de modelos de negócios além do tradicional. Buffett frequentemente expressa sua firme crença na economia americana, encapsulada na sua famosa frase: “Never bet against America”. Essa confiança se une às características comuns aos modelos de negócio que ele escolhe: marcas fortes, gestão eficiente e um apelo emocional que ressoa com os consumidores, criando valor duradouro. Motorhomes, lanchas, casas pré-fabricadas, joalherias, lojas de departamentos, botas country, sorvetes e equipamentos esportivos representam apenas uma amostra dos diversos negócios sob o controle da Berkshire que estavam presentes na conferência. Além desses aspectos fundamentais, Buffett também busca companhias que fortaleçam seus resultados e contribuam com insights para estratégias de investimento mais amplas. Um exemplo é a BNSF Railway, adquirida pela Berkshire em 2009, que opera uma extensa rede ferroviária cobrindo grande parte dos EUA. Esta companhia desempenha um papel crucial no transporte de uma vasta gama de produtos, desde insumos agrícolas até bens de consumo e materiais industriais. O investimento na BNSF não apenas reflete a crença de Buffett no crescimento sustentado dos EUA, mas também lhe permite entender as tendências econômicas e as demandas de transporte do país. Outro investimento significativo é na Pilot, uma rede de postos de combustível e centros de serviços, adquirida em 2017. Com mais de 800 locais espalhadas pela América do Norte, que oferecem combustíveis, alimentos, áreas de descanso e até duchas, a Pilot se tornou essencial para motoristas e viajantes. Havia muitos grupos de brasileiros do mercado financeiro, dos quais alguns veteranos do evento. Eles observaram que a movimentação este ano era visivelmente maior do que nos anteriores, impulsionada provavelmente por fatores como a reabertura da China e, especialmente, o recente falecimento de Charlie Munger, aumentando a ansiedade de ver Warren Buffett, agora com 93 anos, ao vivo. No dia mais aguardado, acordei às 4h da manhã e cheguei à frente do CHI Health Center às 5h, encontrando já uma imensa fila de entusiastas esperando para conseguir lugares próximos a Warren Buffett. Os portões só abririam às 7h e com o céu ainda escuro, o frio de 8 graus e os fortes ventos, a espera não foi simples. Felizmente, havia café gratuito perto da entrada, aliviando um pouco o desconforto. Por estar com uma credencial de imprensa, consegui entrar antes do grande público, às 6h30. Aproveitei o tempo para conversar com os primeiros na fila, vindos de Taipei, em Taiwan, que me disseram ter chegado à 1h30 da madrugada e já mostravam sinais claros de cansaço. Assim que os portões abriram, as pessoas passavam pela revista e corriam em direção à arena, esticando o braço em direção a mesas repletas de pretzels, cinnamon rolls, biscoitos, Coca-Cola, Sprite e água disponíveis para aguentar outras tantas horas do lado de dentro. Consegui sentar na quinta fileira, logo atrás da área reservada ao VIPs – que, como esperado, causaram alvoroço. O momento de maior agitação foi a chegada de Tim Cook, especialmente porque os três grandes telões na parte superior do auditório transmitiam o evento ao vivo. Pouco antes de sua entrada, a Berkshire havia anunciado resultados financeiros mostrando uma redução significativa no investimento na Apple. A filmagem de Cook ao vivo se alternava nos telões com os detalhes da venda das ações. Logo depois, Bill Gates, fundador da Microsoft, roubou a cena. Ele e Buffett são bons amigos. A arena ficou tão cheia que algumas pessoas sentaram atrás do palco, sem vista alguma para onde Buffett apareceria. Tradicionalmente, o evento começa com a exibição de um vídeo de cerca de 20 minutos celebrando de forma bem-humorada as figuras lendárias da companhia. Este ano, a homenagem foi dedicada a Charlie Munger, mostrando momentos divertidos compartilhados pela dupla, incluindo participações em cenas com os personagens de Breaking Bad e The Office. Após esses momentos memoráveis, as luzes finalmente focaram em Warren Buffett, que estava sentado ao lado de Greg Abel, o futuro CEO da Berkshire, e Ajit Jain, Vice-Presidente de Operações de Seguros. Mantendo a tradição, Buffett iniciou discutindo os resultados financeiros recentes antes de abrir para uma extensa sessão de perguntas e respostas, que se prolongou por mais de seis horas. Dois momentos foram particularmente marcantes para mim. O primeiro, quando Buffett, ao passar a palavra para Abel, o chamou de “Charlie”, como se referia a seu longevo parceiro. Esse lapso momentâneo despertou uma reação calorosa da plateia, com um ‘own’ coletivo antes de aplausos efusivos. O segundo foi a mensagem final, em que Buffett expressou seu desejo de ver todos novamente no próximo ano, assim como sua esperança de estar presente também. O fim de semana terminou com um evento típico do estilo Faria Lima: uma corrida na manhã de domingo de 5 km patrocinada pela Brooks, uma das empresas de artigos esportivos sob o guarda-chuva da Berkshire. A experiência de estar em Omaha para a conferência da Berkshire me fez concordar com algo que sempre ouvi de outras pessoas: todo entusiasta do mercado de ações precisa ir uma vez na vida até lá. \n                                        \"Oráculo de Omaha\" enfatizou que futuro CEO da Berkshire não vai dividir responsabilidades sobre onde alocar os recursos                                     \n                                        Sem Munger, megainvestidor terá uma equipe diferente interagindo com o público durante o evento deste sábado (4)                                     \n\n                    Henrique Esteter                \n \n                    Henrique Esteter é coordenador multiplataforma do InfoMoney                 \n"

    "title": "Pilot's hiring spree equals the number of people employed by TVA, University of Tennessee",
    "description": "If Pilot's new summer hires formed their own company in Knoxville, it would be the region's third-largest employer.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-08T09:18:54Z",
    "content": "Pilot Company's summer hiring plans include adding as many workers as the University of Tennessee at Knoxville employs, putting into perspective the continental sprawl of the Knoxville-based travel center and trucking giant. That's 10,000 employees, also about the same number Tennessee Valley Authority employs. If Pilot's new hires formed their own Knoxville company, it would be the region's third-largest employer. Of course, not all new hires will be in the Knoxville area, where Pilot employs around 2,500 people. Pilot, a wholly owned subsidiary of Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway, employs about 30,000 people across a vast fuel trucking and travel center network with more than 870 locations in 44 states and six Canadian provinces. The company includes travel center brands Pilot, Flying J and One9 Fuel Network. Hires will include travel center managers, experienced truck drivers and hourly food and retail service workers, the company said in a May 2 news release. Pilot especially needs a larger workforce in California, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Virginia, where summer travel demand is high. “We are searching for talented and hard-working individuals to join our dynamic workforce,” Julius Cox, Pilot's executive vice president and chief people officer, said in a news release. “We pride ourselves on creating an environment where everyone feels they belong and has the opportunity to have a voice, contribute, learn and grow.\" Knoxville is among the top areas for Pilot's new job openings, thanks largely to the headquarters stationed here. The company will hire 80 team members in Knoxville, Pilot's recruiting program manager Erin Tanner told Knox News via email. Those jobs would be split 55-25 between the corporate office and local stores. The top regions for new hires are: Whether people want a seasonal summer job or something permanent is up to them, Tanner said. \"We are hiring for full-time and part-time roles and do our best to accommodate our team members and their scheduling needs,\" Tanner said. \"Whether an applicant is looking for a permanent role or something short-term, we offer a variety of roles with opportunity for future growth at Pilot.\" Openings are listed at jobs.pilotflyingj.com. Pilot has a benefits package that includes fuel discounts, weekly paychecks, paid parental leave in the U.S., low-cost healthcare plans and tuition assistance. In 2023, the company launched the Fueling Recognition program, which lets managers reward team members with in-app points that can buy items like electronics, gift cards and concert tickets. Its own employees seem to think Pilot is a good employer, too. Pilot won first place in the large company category of the 2022 Top Workplaces awards, a partnership between Knox News and survey firm Energage. The awards are based on employee surveys, and Pilot has landed on the list six times in seven years. The company has taken the top spot twice. In 2022, Pilot launched a $1 billion initiative to remodel 400 of its travel centers and truck stops. The company has remodeled more than 100 stores, including one in Knoxville. The initiative includes donations to support educational technology in school districts across the U.S. Pilot donated $20,000 to Knox County Schools when it reopened its newly designed Lovell Road center in West Knoxville on April 16. Pilot serves an average of 1.3 million customers per day and sells around 15 billion gallons of fuel per year. The company caught the eye of legendary billionaire investor Warren Buffett in 2017 when his holding company Berkshire Hathaway bought its first stake in Pilot. In a series of billion-dollar sales, Berkshire Hathaway bought all of Pilot from the founding Haslam family. The final sale price for Pilot was $13.56 billion, split into three payments: Since Buffett gained a controlling 80% stake in 2023, he has installed several longtime Berkshire managers into Pilot leadership positions, including CEO Adam Wright, CFO Joe Lillo and Pilot Energy President Gary Hoogeveen..

    "title": "El veterano inversor Warren Buffett acumula más de 200.000 millones en efectivo por un buen motivo: no se fía de la bolsa",
    "description": "Considerado como una de las voces más expertas y certeras en materia de inversión, según el Financial Times, el veterano inversor Warren Buffett ha acumulado una ingente cantidad de efectivo que podría superar los 200.000 millones de dólares en las cuentas de…",
    "published_at": "2024-05-08T07:32:26Z",
    "content": "Rubén Andrés Considerado como una de las voces más expertas y certeras en materia de inversión, según el Financial Times, el veterano inversor Warren Buffett ha acumulado una ingente cantidad de efectivo que podría superar los 200.000 millones de dólares en las cuentas de su compañía de inversiones Berkshire Hathaway. La justificación que da a sus inversores debería encender algunas alarmas: no se fía de la situación actual de la bolsa. \"No veo a nadie que tenga una idea clara de cómo usar este dinero de forma efectiva, por lo tanto, hemos decidido no usarlo\", explicó Buffett ante la pregunta de un accionista durante la tradicional rendición de cuentas anual ante los inversores de su compañía, que este año viene marcada por la ausencia de su socio de toda la Charlie Munger, fallecido en noviembre de 2023 a los 99 años. El nonagenario inversor, apodado “el oráculo de Omaha”, tiene un estilo propio de inversión que no se basa en confiar su dinero a marcas, sino a modelos de negocio, apostando por aquellos que, más allá de los resultados en bolsa, conocen su sector. Esa política ha convertido a Warren Buffett en la sexta persona más rica del mundo, según la lista de millonarios de Forbes. Sin embargo, ha llamado la atención de los accionistas presentes en la reunión anual la gran acumulación de efectivo para una empresa como Berkshire Hathaway, dedicada precisamente a invertirlo. El inversor indica que el mercado actual le recuerda más a un casino que a una entidad financiera estable y educada, y prefiere esperar a que el mercado haga una corrección que sacuda Wall Street. “El mundo se está volviendo más complicado, hay más cosas que pueden salir mal y para nosotros es importante estar preparados y poder actuar cuando esto suceda”, asegura el veterano inversor. Durante los primeros tres meses de 2024, el conglomerado aumentó su efectivo hasta alcanzar la impresionante cifra de 189.000 millones de dólares. Tras las últimas ventas de acciones, la cifra se eleva por encima de los 200.000 millones de dólares. Por ponerlo en contexto, esa cantidad equivale a todo el capital de Starbucks y Dell juntas y supera al PIB de un país como Marruecos. La Berkshire Hathaway ha incrementado un 70% su acumulación de efectivo con respecto al ejercicio anterior. El comportamiento de índices de referencia, como el S&P 500, ha mostrado una gran euforia durante 2023, con un incremento del 24%, y un incremento del 8,1% en lo que va de año. Eso, unido a las subidas de los tipos de interés, han puesto en alerta el olfato inversor de Buffett, conocido por su estrategia de inversión cautelosa y reflexiva. En su lugar, la compañía permanece a la espera de la oportunidad adecuada. “Solo intentaremos golpear los lanzamientos que nos gusten”, explicaba el millonario inversor en su intervención. El veterano inversor no es el único que desconfía de la estabilidad de los mercados. Los informes de los analistas de JP Morgan y de Goldman Sachs observaban un mercado sobrecalentado, y aconsejaban cubrirse ante eventuales caídas en determinados sectores. La respuesta de Buffett fue la venta de parte de sus acciones de Apple y HP, que representaba un 40% de su cartera. La reducción del 13% en los primeros tres meses del año y la segunda desinversión consecutiva en la empresa son señales de su actual posición de desconfianza con los mercados y la responsabilidad de la compañía para mantener el patrimonio de sus inversores. La posición conservadora de Berkshire Hathaway queda muy clara tras las explicaciones de Warren Buffett, que tras la muerte de su socio durante los últimos 60 años, ha acelerado su relevo al frente de la compañía. Aunque goza de buena salud, el millonario de 94 años ha señalado a Greg Abel, actual CEO de la división energética de la compañía, como la persona adecuada para llevar las riendas de la compañía. “Creo que la responsabilidad debería ser de él. Hasta ahora ha sido mía y yo he tomado decisiones sobre cómo manejarla, pero debería ser él a partir de ahora”.

    "content": "BYD, the Chinese EV giant backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, has global ambitions—expanding its presence in countries like Japan, Thailand, and Mexico to sell its ultra-affordable EVs worldwide. But one market is conspicuously absent: the U.S. The U.S. EV market is in “a very confusing stage” due to slowing adoption by consumers, BYD Americas CEO Stella Li said Monday. \"The EV penetration in the U.S. actually dropped\" she explained. Speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference in a session moderated by Fortune's Diane Brady, Li reiterated that the Chinese EV giant does “not have plans to sell in the U.S.,” following similar comments made in February. Washington is trying to get China out of the EV supply chain, with recent legislation denying tax credits for vehicles that use Chinese components like batteries. On Monday, Li said that geopolitics was having a \"big impact\" on BYD. \"The U.S. is becoming a very protective market,\" she said. In March, President Joe Biden warned that Chinese cars could present a national security risk, as in-car software could collect data on the surrounding environment and transmit it back to Beijing. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump has threatened to slap an up-to-100% tariff on Chinese vehicle imports if he is elected in November. The Trump administration previously increased the tariff on Chinese car imports to 27.5%. On Monday, Li expressed hope that “everything will be back to normal” after U.S. elections in November, as people become “more solid, thinking about what's the future solution here.\" It’s not just Chinese carmakers that are attracting attention. Last year, members of Congress criticized a planned joint venture between Ford and Chinese battery giant CATL in Michigan, alleging that it might lead to U.S. government money flowing to a Chinese company. Congress is also considering legislation that would block Chinese biotech companies from working with federally funded medical providers. Officials are also reportedly concerned over the use of Chinese cranes at U.S. ports, worrying that such machinery could send data back to China. In February, the Biden administration promised $20 billion in spending for port infrastructure, including domestic crane production. On Monday, Li complained that it’s “not fair” that Chinese companies are automatically seen as working hand-in-hand with the Chinese government. The BYD executive pointed to the current debate about TikTok, owned by the Chinese tech firm ByteDance. In April, the Biden administration signed a law that orders ByteDance to sell TikTok within nine months under threat of a ban. TikTok this week sued the U.S. to block a ban, setting up a First Amendment fight. Li questioned why TikTok demanded such scrutiny. “Even President Biden uses TikTok, so why do they need to ban [it]?\" BYD, which sells both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, is by far the largest seller of \"new energy vehicles\" in China. The company is now targeting overseas markets in an aggressive expansion campaign. BYD is building manufacturing facilities in Hungary, Thailand, Indonesia, and Brazil. Cheap Chinese EVs from companies like BYD are now prompting a backlash. Last October, the European Union launched an anti-subsidy probe into China-made EVs, including those made by BYD. The probe could lead to tariffs on Chinese car imports. For its part, BYD argues that its low prices are due to \"management efficiency\" and investments in technology. On Monday, Li suggested that the U.S. should embrace China’s \"leading\" EV supply chain. \"They will bring the best technology to the country,\" she continued. U.S. officials are learning they can't freeze China out of the EV supply chain completely. Last week, the U.S. agreed to allow carmakers to use Chinese graphite, a critical battery material, and still qualify for tax credits.
