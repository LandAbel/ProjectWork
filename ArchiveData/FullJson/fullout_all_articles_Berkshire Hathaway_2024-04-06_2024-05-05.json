The whole tech rebound, following a significant downturn the year before, was enough to question the validity of value equities, which historically have shown better performances over the long term, according to analysts. Value stocks are mainly well-established companies that despite having stable business models and sustainable dividends, typically trade at lower prices compared to their intrinsic value, presenting an opportunity for investors to purchase them at a discount. Professor-turned-money manager Josef Lakonishok and value investing expert David Dreman truly believed the ‘tortoise beats the hare’ approach in investing. Their research suggested that value investing tends to outperform growth about 70% of the time, irrespective of company size. Through meticulous studies covering companies of varying sizes, they found that value stocks consistently delivered average returns of slightly over 7% per year compared to growth stocks over extended time frames. While value stocks may not have performed as well as growth stocks last year, analysts are highlighting the potential buying opportunities within this space. Morningstar chief US marketing strategist Dave Sekera has given a positive stance on value investing in 2024. Here are some comments from the analysts: “We see much better long-term investment opportunities within the value category and think investors should consider paring those growth stocks that have become overvalued and overextended. Now may be a good time to begin allocating to those contrarian plays that have underperformed, are unloved, and, most importantly, are undervalued.” Analysts at Franklin Templeton have also expressed optimism regarding the performance of value stocks this year. Despite a period where value lagged behind growth on a global scale, the firm predicts a promising outlook ahead due to favorable global stock valuations, indicating potential for positive long-term returns. Moreover, the firm anticipates increased investment in value-oriented sectors and segments of the market, driven by ongoing consumer spending and recent government initiatives. The normalization of monetary policy is also expected to enhance the appeal of interest rate-sensitive and dividend-paying sectors to investors. As we mentioned above, value stocks are often recognized for their dividends. Moreover, these equities offer higher dividend yields and have strong fundamental ratios when compared with growth stocks. Dividend growth is one of the most important factors when it comes to dividend investing. In this regard, The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index is used as a benchmark for dividend-focused strategies. The index seeks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. In 30 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts, we referred to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices which revealed that investment strategies aimed at generating income often show value characteristics. Stocks that offer high dividend yields and trade at lower prices often grab investors’ attention. We also revealed that the dividend aristocrat index possesses a combination a combination of both growth and value attributes, rather than exhibiting a strong preference for one style over the other. A detailed analysis of the index from 1999 to 2022 revealed its style breakdown, indicating an average exposure of 59.04% to value stocks and 40.94% to growth stocks during this time period.

    "title": "China's EV competition is so fierce that Volkswagen ‘cannot keep up’ and should avoid ‘utopian expectations,’ says CEO",
    "description": "The intense competition in China’s EV space is having ripple effects both within and outside the country, as VW can attest to.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-06T20:39:55Z",
    "content": "Competing against Chinese electric vehicles in China is no easy task. Just ask the CEO of Volkswagen. The automaker “cannot keep up at the top of the table at the moment” in China’s EV sector, VW chief Oliver Blume told Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in a Friday interview, as spotted by Reuters. VW had long been China’s bestselling automotive brand, but last year it was overtaken by Chinese rival BYD, which sells both EVs and plug-in hybrids but no longer produces traditional cars. BYD, backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, also beat Tesla for the first time in global sales of electric vehicles in the fourth quarter of last year, although Elon Musk’s carmaker reclaimed the crown in the first three months of this year.  With sales of traditional vehicles declining in China, carmakers more focused on EVs have been gaining market share at the expense of legacy automakers. VW, with its local partners, still sells traditional vehicles in China, in addition to a relatively small number of EVs compared to BYD. The intense competition in China’s EV space is having ripple effects both within and outside the country. Last month, Bloomberg reported that Tesla planned to reduce production at its Shanghai plant, with the carmaker facing ever stiffer competition from Chinese rivals offering more affordable EVs with all manner of features. Across the globe, legacy automakers have been taken aback by the prices at which Chinese EV makers—which are rapidly expanding exports—can offer their vehicles. In the U.S., trade groups and lawmakers are warning about Chinese EV makers possibly gaining market entry through Mexico and want already tough protectionist measures to be strengthened. In the EU, the European Commission is looking into whether Chinese EV makers have an unfair advantage thanks to government subsidies, and could recommend higher tariffs. “If there are no trade barriers established,” Musk said earlier this year of Chinese automakers, “they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world. They’re extremely good.” “No one can match BYD on price. Period,” Michael Dunne, CEO of Asia-focused car consultancy Dunne Insights, told the Financial Times in January. “Boardrooms in America, Europe, Korea, and Japan are in a state of shock.” Interestingly Australia, which has no legacy automakers to protect, is putting up no roadblocks to Chinese EV makers, which are quickly expanding there. In Japan last month, Nissan and Honda, facing the looming threat of Chinese EV giants, announced a once unthinkable partnership to develop electric vehicles together.  “The rise of emerging players is becoming faster and stronger,” Honda president Toshihiro Mibe told the Financial Times. “Companies that cannot respond to the changes will be wiped out.” Similarly, Ford said in February it’s open to cooperating with rivals to lower EV production costs, with GM signaling a similar willingness. Both cited the rising threat from China. As for Volkswagen, it said it might collaborate on mass-market EVs with French rival Renault, also with Chinese up-and-comers in mind. As for competing on EVs within China, said VW chief Blume, his carmaker “shouldn’t have utopian expectations.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Some or all links contained within this article are paid links. According to the world’s most famous investor, the “incredible period” for the U.S. economy has been coming to an end in recent months. And even his own company, Berkshire Hathaway, isn’t immune. “The majority of our businesses will report lower earnings this year than last year,” Buffett cautioned at Berkshire’s annual meeting in May of last year. That’s a somewhat surprising statement from a man who has famously been ultra-bullish on the U.S. economy. But persistently high inflation and interest rates and the ongoing banking crisis have all made Buffett much more concerned about investment gains in the year ahead. His late business partner, Charlie Munger, echoed this sentiment at the time. “Get used to making less,” Munger said. But what about this year? J.P. Morgan anticipates slow growth for investors . Commercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger Cost-of-living in America is still out of control — use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord. Here's how In J.P Morgan's global market outlook for 2024 report, Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, said \"we think the decline in inflation and economic activity we forecast for 2024 will at some point make investors worry or perhaps even panic.\" Investors should probably heed the Oracle of Omaha’s warning, but that doesn’t mean completely retreating from the market is the right strategy. Instead, there are a couple ways to diversify your portfolio enough to withstand these downward forces. Some service sectors are relatively detached from the rest of the economy. Usually, these businesses are backed by a trove of hard, recession-resistant assets that retain their value through inflationary waves. When it comes to shockproof investments, commercial real estate is a great option that has long been touted for its inflation-hedging benefits. First National Realty Partners makes this asset easily accessible through their online platform, giving everyday investors the opportunity to invest in institutional-quality, grocery-anchored commercial real estate. Since the properties are all anchored by major grocery chains like Walmart and Whole Foods, they generate steady monthly income regardless of economic circumstances. If you're keen on other kinds of real estate, like rentals, Arrived is the platform for you. Through Arrived, you can easily invest in rental homes and vacation rentals without having to play landlord. Arrived offers a low minimum investment of $100, so getting started is accessible You could also take advantage of real estate through REITs with Fundrise— an easy-to-use investment app that helps you gain access to private assets without the high-end price tag. REITs provide income, diversification and protection from inflation, making them a solid choice for your retirement savings. When it comes to actually managing your portfolio, you don't have to go it alone with Wealthfront Brokerage. Wealthfront Brokerage is a stock trading platform available to help you gain some familiarity with the market. Wealthfront’s easy-to-use platform offers customizable portfolios and guides clients in identifying, tracking and achieving their financial goals. Fine art is another recession-resistant asset that can help pad your portfolio. And thanks to a platform called Masterworks, you can now invest in art without having to drop millions at auction on a single painting. With Masterworks, you can buy shares of iconic artworks the same way you’d buy stocks. It only takes a few minutes to sign up and start investing in paintings by celebrity artists like Banksy and Basquiat, right from your home — no formal-wear required.

Here's how you can save yourself as much as $820 annually in minutes (it's 100% free) While fears of a recession have cooled for 2024, there are still lingering fears that the U.S. economy could shrink over the course of the year. But developing markets are far less vulnerable to a recession. In fact, the International Monetary Fund points to economies like Brazil, India and Southeast Asia showing accelerated growth. Put simply, investors could safeguard their wealth by investing in foreign stocks. With Robinhood — a commission-free investing app — you have access to over 650 global stocks through American Depository Receipts (ADRs). Robinhood offers a range of account types with no account minimums, making it easy for anyone to start investing in the global stock market, regardless of how much (or how little) they have to spend.

Unternehmen müssen ihre Aktionäre bei der Stange halten. Nur mit zufriedenen Eigentümern im Rücken lässt sich ein Geschäft erfolgreich betreiben. Das gilt in besonderem Masse für die UBS, die mit der Einverleibung der Credit Suisse beschäftigt ist. So kündigte die Grossbank diese Woche an, inmitten der Integrationsarbeiten ein neues Aktienrückkaufprogramm in der Höhe von bis zu zwei Milliarden Dollar zu starten. Nach Ankündigung der CS-Übernahme hatte die UBS solche Rückkäufe ausgesetzt. Auch die ABB hat dieses Jahr ein neues Rückkaufprogramm in Milliardenhöhe lanciert. Die Badener Industriegruppe hat seit 2020 eigene Aktien im Gesamtwert von mehr als 9 Milliarden Franken zurückgekauft, was den Anstieg des Aktienkurses seither unterstützt. Die Idee hinter solchen Transaktionen: Erwirbt ein Unternehmen eigene Aktien, sind weniger im Umlauf. Dadurch verteilt sich der Unternehmensgewinn auf weniger Titel, er wird «verdichtet». Mehr Gewinn pro Aktie bedeutet theoretisch einen höheren Preis, der Aktienkurs muss also steigen. Die Praxis, Aktienkurse auf diese Weise zu frisieren, ist nicht nur in der Schweiz verbreitet. In den USA sind Aktienrückkäufe sogar beliebter als Dividenden, was sie zum Gegenstand hitziger Debatten macht. Befürworter wie die Investoren-Legende Warren Buffett setzen viele Milliarden ein, um Aktien der eigenen Gesellschaft zurückzukaufen. So hat Berkshire Hathaway gemäss Eingabe bei der US-Wertschriftenbehörde SEC seit Anfang Jahr Aktien im Umfang von über 2 Milliarden Dollar zurückgekauft, im Vorjahr waren es über 9 Milliarden, im Jahr 2021 sogar 27. Für die demokratische US-Senatorin Elizabeth Warren ist das reine «Marktmanipulation», die illegal sein sollte. Das Geld solle nicht dazu dienen, Kurse in die Höhe zu treiben und Aktionäre zu bereichern. Rückkäufe würden der Wirtschaft nichts nützen und kannibalisierten die Innovation. Die Firmen sollten ihren Mitarbeitern lieber bessere Löhne zahlen, so Warren. Doch auch in der Finanzindustrie gibt es kritische Stimmen. So sieht der namhafte Investor Jeremy Grantham ebenfalls ein manipulatives Element: Firmenchefs sind Insider und stützen ihre Kaufentscheidungen auf Informationen, die nicht allen zugänglich sind. So können sie den Aktienkurs zu ihren Gunsten beeinflussen. In den USA war die Praxis aus diesem Grund bis 1982 mehrheitlich verboten. Harry Goodacre, ein Stratege beim Vermögensverwalter Schroders, beschreibt ein weiteres Problem: «Wenn die Vergütung der Führungskräfte naiv an das Wachstum des Gewinns pro Aktie gekoppelt ist, kann dies zu einer Bereicherung der Geschäftsleitung führen, möglicherweise auf Kosten der Aktionäre.» Warren Buffett nimmt solche Kritik wenig ernst. Wenn manche sagten, dass alle Rückkäufe den Aktionären oder dem Land schadeten und insbesondere den CEO nützten, dann seien das «wirtschaftliche Analphabeten und sprachgewandte Demagogen». Würden Rückkäufe zu einem «wertsteigernden» Preis getätigt, komme das allen Aktionären zugute, schrieb er in seinem jüngsten Aktionärsbrief. Die Debatte ist politisch, zumal in den USA vor einigen Wochen eine neue Steuer auf Aktienrückkäufe in Kraft trat. Hierzulande ist die Diskussion weniger aufgeladen. Investoren sehen in Rückkäufen oft bloss ein weiteres Element neben den Dividenden, welches die Rendite ihres Investments verbessert. Und nur darauf kommt es Aktionären an. Es gibt empirische Studien, die nahelegen, dass Aktienrückkäufe kurz- wie langfristig die Rendite verbessern, sofern eine Unterbewertung vorliegt und der Markt genügend liquid und effizient ist. Doch wozu dienen Rückkäufe genau? Für Vontobel-Aktienanalytiker Manuel Lang stellen Aktienrückkäufe für Unternehmen zunächst eine flexible Methode zur Rückführung überschüssiger Barmittel an die Aktionäre dar. Es sei flexibel, weil die Unternehmen frei entscheiden können, wann und wie viel sie zurückkaufen oder nicht. Das ist ein Vorteil gegenüber Dividenden. Diese müssen regelmässig gezahlt werden. Die Aktionäre erwarten, dass jedes Jahr eine Ausschüttung erfolgt, Überraschungen kommen nicht gut an. Zudem sollte die Dividende nach Möglichkeit erhöht oder zumindest gehalten werden – alles andere wird dahingehend interpretiert, dass bei der Firma etwas nicht rund läuft. Aktienrückkäufe sind weniger verbindlich. Hinzu kommen steuerliche Vorteile. Bei Dividenden fallen doppelt Steuern an; einmal beim Unternehmen auf dem Gewinn, ein weiteres Mal bei den Aktionären, weil Dividenden dem Einkommen zugeschlagen und versteuert werden müssen. Auf Kapitalgewinne sind die Steuern meist niedriger. Für eine Firma kann es zudem sinnvoll sein, eigene Titel zurückzukaufen, wenn das Management der Meinung ist, dass die Aktien fundamental mehr wert sind, als der Aktienpreis anzeigt. Werden aus diesem Grund Aktien zurückgekauft, entspricht das einer Investition in das eigene Unternehmen, mit einem Rabatt. Gemäss Lang neigen Unternehmen dazu, Aktien schneller zurückzukaufen, wenn sie diese als unterbewertet ansehen. So hat etwa Holcim Aktien im Wert von 2 Milliarden Franken innerhalb von nur sieben Monaten zu einem Durchschnittspreis von 54 Franken gekauft – heute stehen die Titel bei etwa 80 Franken. Das freut die Aktionäre, zumal der Zementkonzern dieses Jahr ein neues Rückkaufprogramm aufgelegt hat, um den Aktienkurs weiter zu «pflegen». Obschon Rückkäufe populär sind, hat ihr Volumen in der Schweiz um rund ein Drittel abgenommen. Gemäss einer Auswertung der Bank Vontobel kauften Schweizer Unternehmen 2023 eigene Aktien im Wert von total 21 Milliarden Franken zurück. Zurzeit laufen Programme über 24 Milliarden. Auch in den USA gingen die Rückkäufe zurück. Dass das Volumen von Jahr zu Jahr ändert, hat damit zu tun, dass grosse Rückkäufe wie das 20-Milliarden-Programm von Nestlé auslaufen. Es gibt aber auch zyklische Gründe. Viele Börsen notieren weiter nahe ihren Höchstständen, viele Aktien sind hoch bewertet. Unternehmen steht es frei, ihre Rückkäufe auszusetzen und bei attraktiveren, sprich tieferen Preisen wieder aufzunehmen. Doch nicht alle Rückkäufe erfüllen ihren ursprünglichen Zweck und führen zu einer Gewinn-Verdichtung. «In den USA werden nach Rückkäufen tendenziell weniger Aktien vernichtet», stellt Lang fest. Das heisst, die gesamte Anzahl Aktien bleibt gleich; es handelt sich um Schein-Rückkäufe. Die so erworbenen Aktien können für Akquisitionen eingesetzt werden oder dienen der Vergütung des Managements. Die Aktionäre haben direkt nichts davon. Solche Transaktionen kommen auch in der Schweiz vor. So haben Unternehmen wie Logitech, Partners Group oder Richemont eigene Aktien zurückgekauft und einbehalten, um diese dann ihren Managern als Aktien-basierte Vergütung zuzuteilen oder um sie als «Währung für Übernahmen» parat zu haben. Auch die UBS hat jüngst Aktien als Akquisitions-Währung genutzt. Sie hat die Übernahme der CS für drei Milliarden Franken vollständig mit eigenen Aktien finanziert. So musste die Bank keinen einzigen Franken in Cash in die Hand nehmen."

    "content": "Washington Monthly Click here for the Monthly‘s Presidential Accomplishment Index and more essays comparing Trump and Biden’s achievements in office. In the months before the 2016 election, corporate concentration broke through as a salient issue in Washington for the first time in decades. Building on years of work published in the Washington Monthly by Barry Lynn, Lina Khan, Phillip Longman, and others, mainstream Democrats began speaking of America’s monopoly problem, linking it to rising inequality and falling rates of entrepreneurship. That April, Barack Obama’s administration, after years of lax antitrust enforcement, published a white paper documenting the growing dominance of large firms over the economy and its baleful effects on economic opportunity. On the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton became the first major presidential candidate in decades to advocate tougher antitrust enforcement.  Donald Trump, Clinton’s rival for the presidency, also spoke out on the issue that year. After AT&T announced plans to acquire Time Warner, Trump declared in October 2016 that the proposed merger would be “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” and promised to block it. Trump spoke against the monopoly power of companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google. Shortly after being elected, Trump’s Department of Justice moved as promised to block the AT&T/Time Warner deal, one of the government’s most ambitious merger cases in 40 years.  Observers across the political spectrum applauded, warning that the merger would lead to fewer outlets for independent programming and too much concentrated power over the information environment. But many became critics after the judge criticized the prosecutors for resting their case on a highly technical, unprovable claim that the merger would harm consumers, and ruled in favor of the merger.  Still more disillusioning to antitrust reformers was the question of Trump’s motives.  Trump had a long history of criticizing CNN, which was owned by Time Warner. He had even once publicized a doctored video that depicted him body-slamming the CNN logo. After the DOJ brought its suit, a New Yorker investigation confirmed that Trump had personally told deputies to have the merger blocked as punishment for CNN’s unfavorable coverage.  Adding to doubts about the sincerity of Trump’s opposition to monopoly, the DOJ soon afterward waved through Disney’s acquisition of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox, a deal that drastically consolidated media markets. Though Trump’s preferred network, Fox News, was left out of the deal, the sale inflated Fox chairman Rupert Murdoch’s personal fortune by billions of dollars, for which Trump offered his personal congratulations. The favoritism bore an obvious resemblance to an infamous episode from a half century earlier: Richard Nixon’s interference in International Telephone & Telegraph’s purchase of the Hartford Fire Insurance Company, at the time the biggest merger in American history. In June 1969, when the DOJ was preparing a suit to block the sale, Nixon ordered his deputy attorney general to back off. As reporters soon uncovered, ITT’s CEO was a close friend and ally of Nixon’s, and the company had secretly contributed $400,000 to his reelection campaign. If such a scandalous quid pro quo is historically rare in antitrust enforcement, Democrats, too, sometimes exercise prosecutorial discretion. Lyndon Johnson held up the antitrust review of a bank merger until the owner of one of the banks, who also ran a newspaper, agreed to give him more flattering coverage. Despite the urging of Federal Trade Commission officials, Obama declined to take antitrust action against Google, which had forged a close partnership with his administration. Google’s employees had contributed more to his reelection campaign than almost any other company. But the selective application of the law was endemic to Trump’s antitrust operation. Makan Delrahim, the head of the DOJ antitrust division under Trump, gestured toward populist criticisms of the long-standing antitrust status quo. But in summer 2019, when Sprint and T-Mobile were working toward a merger that would reduce the number of major cell service providers from four to three, Delrahim not only declined to intervene but actively worked to ensure that the deal went through, lobbying other regulators and members of Congress and fighting an antitrust suit brought by a group of states. His motives were apparent: Sprint is majority owned by SoftBank, and SoftBank’s chairman, Masayoshi Son, is a known ally of Trump’s.  By contrast, shortly after Trump posted several furious tweets about an agreement Ford, BMW, Volkswagen, and Honda had made with California to set stricter emissions standards than those proposed by the White House, Delrahim opened a plainly baseless antitrust investigation into the four companies. The New York Times editorial board called it a “cruel parody of antitrust enforcement,” and the policy writer David Dayen observed that “the notion that the automakers conspired with each other to raise fuel standards in a bid to limit competition is a joke.” As Matthew Buck and Sandeep Vaheesan of the Open Markets Institute documented, Delrahim also made a habit of helping out large corporations by involving the DOJ in antitrust lawsuits where it wasn’t a party. On several occasions in office, he issued amicus briefs defending tech giants like Apple and Comcast facing antitrust lawsuits from states and consumers.  In June 2020, the career DOJ official John Elias revealed during congressional testimony that the department had devoted major resources to other dubious investigations. Attorney General Bill Barr, for example, ordered a series of unfounded antitrust investigations of cannabis companies. Probes into “Big Pot” accounted for 29 percent of the antitrust division’s merger investigations. Trump’s relationship with the FTC, which has major antitrust powers, reveals a similar pattern. After Trump finally appointed someone to chair the FTC in 2018, his choice, the attorney Joseph Simons, announced that he would become far more aggressive on antitrust. But he essentially did the opposite, presiding over a largely passive period for the agency. Trump’s FTC filed about 21 total merger enforcement actions per year, only slightly more than under the Obama and George W. Bush administrations.  Trump’s FTC won only one major decision against a monopolist in its first three years: the chipmaker Qualcomm for its dominance of critical components in cell phones. Yet after a district court ruled in favor of the FTC, this lone success was torpedoed by internecine squabbling. When Qualcomm appealed, the DOJ took the unheard-of move of intervening against the FTC, filing a motion defending Qualcomm. Delrahim, as it happens, was outside counsel for Qualcomm for many years prior to his federal service, though he officially recused himself from the case. Qualcomm won on appeal in 2020. To their credit, during Trump’s final months in office, regulators filed two historic lawsuits against tech monopolists: one against Google for its dominance of the search engine market, and another against Facebook calling for it to divest WhatsApp and Instagram. (The Google search case went to trial in fall 2023.) Though advocates worry that those cases, like the case against Time Warner and AT&T, were imperfectly designed by a chaotic administration, they nevertheless helped reestablish a more confrontational enforcement paradigm on antitrust.  Democrats became increasingly focused on combating monopoly during Trump’s time in office. U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar, Al Franken, Cory Booker, and Elizabeth Warren delivered soaring speeches about confronting monopolies and introduced new legislation to strengthen antitrust law. In 2019, the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee opened a sprawling investigation led by Democrat David Cicilline that documented how Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google use their monopoly power to threaten free enterprise and democracy. On the campaign trail in 2020, the field of candidates competed on who had the best anti-monopoly plan.  Biden was not at the vanguard of this movement in his party, but his campaign’s policy papers included promises to confront monopolies. Then, after he won the election, Biden committed to the cause like no other president had in modern times. He appointed one of the movement’s brightest and most aggressive reformers, Lina Khan, to run the FTC, as well as other fierce critics of corporate concentration in key posts, including Jonathan Kanter, who took over the antitrust division of the DOJ, and Tim Wu, who became a key economic adviser inside the White House. Six months after taking office, Biden issued a whole-of-government executive order that called on 17 different government agencies to take 72 actions to foster competition and protect consumers against monopolies. As a result, agencies like the FTC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Food and Drug Administration have cracked down on public scourges like price gouging, noncompete contracts, and banking-related junk fees, and created new rules to make consolidated industries like the hearing aid market more competitive.  Under Kanter and Khan, the DOJ and FTC have also filed far more ambitious antitrust investigations than any administration in decades. Last summer, an investigation into several food production conglomerates over wage suppression and collusion resulted in an $85 million settlement, one of several successful DOJ investigations into no-poach and wage-fixing schemes across the economy. In December, the FTC successfully blocked the medical data firm IQVIA’s attempt to monopolize the business of advertising to doctors through the purchase of an ad tech company called DeepIntent. And in January, a judge sided with the DOJ in its suit against a JetBlue-Spirit merger, the first successful prosecution of an airline merger in 40 years.  The effect of a more aggressive posture from regulators goes beyond favorable court rulings: Under the threat of litigation, Amazon, Lockheed Martin, Berkshire Hathaway, and the chipmaker Nvidia were some of the companies to back off multibillion-dollar acquisitions of smaller firms. Biden’s regulators filed a record 50 antitrust enforcement actions last year, and mergers dropped to a 10-year low. Trump’s regulators, like all administrations of the past 40 years before Biden, argued cases mainly on the narrow basis of harms to consumers. But Khan and other reformers argue for reestablishing an interpretation of antitrust law that’s more expansive than this “consumer welfare standard.” Under Biden, regulators have rewritten the government’s lax merger guidelines and have often focused their legal strategy on the harms done to producers as well as consumers. For example, in October 2022, regulators secured one of the most important victories of the Biden era with a successful challenge to a merger between Simon & Schuster and Penguin Random House, which would have cut the number of major publishers in the U.S. from five to four. Prosecutors focused their arguments on how the industry’s consolidation hurts authors, not consumers; by winning with that argument, they established the precedent that antitrust cases can be won by proving harm to both workers and independent contractors.  The selective application of the law was endemic to Trump’s antitrust operation. But under Biden, the government has filed far more ambitious antitrust investigations than any administration in decades. The federal judiciary is largely accustomed to ruling leniently on antitrust cases, and Biden’s regulators have also lost several important cases, including lawsuits against Meta’s acquisition of the virtual reality firm Within and Microsoft’s acquisition of the video game company Activision Blizzard. But even in losses, arguments advanced by prosecutors have helped establish useful precedent. For example, in the Within case, the FTC argued that a monopolist’s acquisition of a budding company in the industry, rather than a well-established competitor, can breach antitrust law, and that a large corporation’s investments in a market it’s not already in—virtual reality, in this case—can harm competition. In his decision, the judge acknowledged both arguments as valid in principle, marking the first instance since the 1980s that a court has endorsed such arguments. Moving away from the consumer welfare standard will be especially important for regulating tech platforms like Google and Amazon that offer free or cheap services to consumers while gouging the businesses that have no choice but to market on their platforms. Last year, regulators announced two more long-awaited, major tech lawsuits. The first, another against Google, charges the company with maintaining a monopoly over online advertising by controlling the tools and digital auction systems companies use to place ads. Google siphons ad revenue from publishers, making the business of journalism unsustainable. The second investigates Amazon’s coercive behavior toward online merchants, including its practice of punishing businesses that sell on its Marketplace for offering lower prices elsewhere. These and other important antitrust cases—for example, the FTC’s investigations into the cartel behind hospital drug shortages, a private equity firm’s roll-up of anesthesiology providers, and Big Tech’s investments in artificial intelligence companies—will become the responsibility of whichever administration wins in November.  Much of the business world is betting it will be Trump. After a long dip in merger activity, the monopoly researcher Matt Stoller noted the announcement of several high-value mergers this winter: Exxon made an offer to buy the shale producer Pioneer; Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines proposed combining; Chevron is buying Hess; and more. “I don’t mean to say that Trump will win,” Stoller wrote, “only that Exxon, Humana, Chevron, et al. are betting that they might find a far more favorable climate when their deal goes to trial.” In other words, monopolists know that the self-proclaimed first businessman president was a lot more bark than bite on enforcement. Maybe that would change a second time around: Conservative think tanks like the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society that are hoping to staff a Trump administration are starting to eschew the party’s market fundamentalism orthodoxy and embrace anti-monopolism. But Trump has made clear he’d use another term to punish his enemies and protect his cronies by whatever legal tools available, and there’s little to suggest that he’d staff his administration with fair-minded regulators instead of willing sycophants.  A second term for Biden, on the other hand, would ensure the meticulous prosecution of ongoing antitrust lawsuits against Google, Amazon, Apple, Live Nation, Visa, UnitedHealth Group, Exxon Mobil, Subway, Kroger and Albertsons, and others. It would also mean the furthering of Biden’s whole-of-government effort to crack down on all forms of anticompetitive behavior. In February, the CFPB announced that it’s taking on credit card comparison websites that take kickbacks from banks to move their cards up the rankings, stifling competition, and is building its own public comparison-shopping site. In March, the FTC launched an investigation into price-fixing and collusion among landlords and property managers in the highly consolidated rental market. Proposed rules that would ban auto dealers from using bait-and-switch tactics, protect small poultry farmers from deceptive corporate distributors, break up the organ donor network monopoly, and restore net neutrality are popping up across the government.  Ahead of the election, with satisfaction with the economy still low, Biden is doubling down in his war on shady pricing practices. In his State of the Union address, Biden railed against “deceptive pricing from food to health care to housing” and promised to crack down further on junk fees. “Snack companies think you won’t notice when they charge you just as much for the same size bag but with fewer chips in it,” he scoffed, and called on Congress to pass Senator Bob Casey’s recent anti-shrinkflation bill. In March, he issued a new executive order creating an FTC- and DOJ-led “Strike Force” to target anticompetitive practices across the economy, instituting new rules that slash credit card late fees from the current average of $32 down to $8, banning deceptive contracts in farming and ranching, and more. Whether all this momentum translates into real wins against corporate power will depend on who occupies the White House.  Will Norris is an editor at the Washington Monthly.

    "content": " Paul Resch remembers playing baseball as a kid on a field constructed from asbestos-tainted vermiculite, mere yards from railroad tracks where trains kicked up clouds of dust as they hauled the contaminated material from a mountaintop mine through the northwestern Montana town of Libby. He liked to sneak into vermiculite-filled storage bins at an adjacent rail yard, to trap pigeons that he would feed, during long days spent by the tracks along the Kootenai River. Today, Resch, 61, is battling an asbestos-related disease that has severely scarred his left lung. He’s easily winded, quickly tires and knows there is no cure for an illness that could suffocate him over time. “At some point, probably everybody got exposed to it,” he said, speaking of asbestos-tainted vermiculite. “There was piles of it along the railroad tracks. … You would get clouds of dust blowing around downtown.” Almost 25 years after federal authorities responding to news reports of deaths and illnesses descended on Libby, a town of about 3,000 people near the U.S.-Canada border, some asbestos victims and their family members are seeking to hold publicly accountable one of the major corporate players in the tragedy: BNSF Railway. Hundreds of people died and more than 3,000 have been sickened from asbestos exposure in the Libby area, according to researchers and health officials. Texas-based BNSF faces accusations of negligence and wrongful death for failing to control clouds of contaminated dust that used to swirl from the rail yard and settle across Libby’s neighborhoods. The vermiculite was shipped by rail from Libby for use as insulation in homes and businesses across the U.S. The first trial among what attorneys say are hundreds of lawsuits against BNSF for its alleged role polluting the Libby community is scheduled to begin Monday. The railroad — owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. — has denied responsibility in court filings and declined further comment. Resch works at an auto dealership in Libby and his wife is listed as a plaintiff in a pending lawsuit against BNSF in Montana’s asbestos claims court. He’s uncertain whether his sickness came from the rail yard. The Libby high school track included contaminated vermiculite, as did insulation in the walls and attics of homes he entered during his two decades as a volunteer firefighter. The plaintiffs for the upcoming trial against BNSF, the estates of Joyce Walder and Thomas Wells, lived near the Libby rail yard and moved away decades ago. Both died in 2020 of mesothelioma, a rare lung cancer caused by asbestos that is disproportionately common in Libby. The mine a few miles outside town once produced up to 80% of global vermiculite supplies. It closed in 1990. Nine years later, the Environmental Protection Agency arrived in Libby and a subsequent cleanup has cost an estimated $600 million, with most covered by taxpayer money. It’s ongoing, but authorities say asbestos volumes in downtown Libby’s air are 100,000 times lower than when the mine was operating. Awareness about the dangers of asbestos grew significantly over the intervening years, and last month the EPA banned the last remaining industrial uses of asbestos in the U.S. The ban did not include the type of asbestos fiber found in Libby or address so-called “legacy” asbestos that’s already in homes, schools and businesses. A long-awaited government analysis of the remaining risks is due by Dec. 1. Asbestos doesn’t burn and resists corrosion, making it long lasting in the environment. People who inhale the needle-shaped fibers can develop health problems as many as 40 years after exposure. Health officials expect to grapple with newly diagnosed cases of asbestos disease for decades. The EPA declared the nation’s first ever public health emergency under the Superfund cleanup program in Libby in 2009. The pollution led to civil claims from thousands of people who worked for the mine or the railroad, or who lived in the Libby area. During a yearslong cleanup of the Libby rail yard that began in 2003, crews excavated nearly the entire yard, removing about 18,000 tons of contaminated soil. In 2020, BNSF signed a consent decree with federal authorities resolving its cleanup work in Libby and nearby Troy, plus a 42-mile stretch (68 kilometers) of railroad right-of-way. Last year, BNSF won a federal lawsuit against an asbestos treatment clinic in Libby that a jury found submitted 337 false asbestos claims, making patients eligible for Medicare and other benefits. The judge overseeing the case ordered the Center for Asbestos Related Disease to pay almost $6 million in penalties and damages, forcing the facility into bankruptcy. It continues to operate with reduced staff. Some asbestos victims viewed the case as a ploy to discredit the clinic and undermine lawsuits against the railroad. BNSF said the verdict would deter “future misconduct” by the clinic. In the months leading up to this week’s trial, attorneys for BNSF repeatedly tried to deflect blame for people getting sick, including by pointing to the actions of W.R. Grace and Co., which owned the mine from 1963 until it closed. They also questioned whether other asbestos sources could have caused the two plaintiffs’ illnesses and suggested Walder and Wells would have been trespassing on railroad property. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris blocked BNSF from blaming the conduct of others as a means of escaping liability. And he said the law doesn’t support the notion that trespassing reduces a property owner’s duty not to cause harm. Morris has yet to issue a definitive ruling on another key issue: the railroad’s claim that its obligation to ship goods for paying customers exempts it from liability. The plaintiffs argue the rail yard in downtown Libby — where Resch once played in piles of vermiculite — was used for storage and not just transportation, meaning the railroad is not exempt. Montana’s Supreme Court has ruled in a separate case that BNSF and its predecessors were more involved in the mine than simply shipping its product. Mine owner W.R. Grace filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and paid $1.8 billion into an asbestos trust fund to settle future cases. It paid about $270 million to government agencies for environmental damages and cleanup work. The state of Montana was also faulted in Libby, for failing to warn residents about asbestos exposure. It paid settlements totaling $68 million to about 2,000 plaintiffs. BNSF has settled some previous lawsuits for undisclosed amounts, attorneys for plaintiffs said. A second trial against the railroad over the death of a Libby resident is scheduled for May in federal court in Missoula. “I sure hope that they give those folks justice,” Resch said about the upcoming trials. “I mean everybody took part in it as far as corporate America goes.” Hanson reported from Helena, Montana. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

It continues to operate with reduced staff. Some asbestos victims viewed the case as a ploy to discredit the clinic and undermine lawsuits against the railroad. BNSF said the verdict would deter “future misconduct” by the clinic. In the months leading up to this week’s trial, attorneys for BNSF repeatedly tried to deflect blame for people getting sick, including by pointing to the actions of W.R. Grace and Co., which owned the mine from 1963 until it closed.  They also questioned whether other asbestos sources could have caused the two plaintiffs’ illnesses and suggested Walder and Wells would have been trespassing on railroad property. US District Court Judge Brian Morris blocked BNSF from blaming the conduct of others as a means of escaping liability. And he said the law doesn’t support the notion that trespassing reduces a property owner’s duty not to cause harm. Morris has yet to issue a definitive ruling on another key issue: the railroad’s claim that its obligation to ship goods for paying customers exempts it from liability. The plaintiffs argue the rail yard in downtown Libby — where Resch once played in piles of vermiculite — was used for storage and not just transportation, meaning the railroad is not exempt. Montana’s Supreme Court has ruled in a separate case that BNSF and its predecessors were more involved in the mine than simply shipping its product. Mine owner W.R. Grace filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and paid $1.8 billion into an asbestos trust fund to settle future cases. It paid about $270 million to government agencies for environmental damages and cleanup work.  The state of Montana was also faulted in Libby, for failing to warn residents about asbestos exposure. It paid settlements totaling $68 million to about 2,000 plaintiffs. BNSF has settled some previous lawsuits for undisclosed amounts, attorneys for plaintiffs said. A second trial against the railroad over the death of a Libby resident is scheduled for May in federal court in Missoula. “I sure hope that they give those folks justice,” Resch said about the upcoming trials. “I mean everybody took part in it as far as corporate America goes.” Advertisement"

    "description": "Ekonom oslovil významné průmyslníky, kteří pracují i v pokročilém věku. Jak se s přibývajícími lety mění jejich styl práce a řízení lidí?",
    "published_at": "2024-04-07T16:09:11Z",
    "content": "Já jsem mladý, říká přesvědčivě Lubomír Stoklásek, ředitel a majitel firmy Agrostroj Pelhřimov, vyrábějící zemědělskou techniku. Narážku na vyšší věk považuje za nepatřičnou. Ačkoliv v lednu oslavil 74. narozeniny, odpočívat se rozhodně nechystá. \"Budu pracovat dalších dvacet let,\" plánuje. Žádné změny svého manažerského stylu nepozoruje. \"Řídím lidi pořád stejně,\" tvrdí byznysmen, jehož firma zaměstnává jen na Vysočině přes dva tisíce lidí. \"Další dva závody máme v Německu, tři ve Spojených státech a jeden v Polsku,\" vyjmenovává Stoklásek a popisuje, jak před časem koupil německou firmu Stoll, vyrábějící zemědělské nakladače. Téměř sto procent produkce holdingu se vyváží. Když má prozradit recept na úspěch, odpovídá jednoznačně: \"Chodíme do fabriky a pracujeme i 12 hodin denně.\" Připouští, že to zní banálně, ale podle něj se na důležitost tvrdé a poctivé práce dnes zapomíná. I po sedmdesátce přichází Stoklásek ve firmě s novými nápady a inovacemi, do udržovacího režimu se rozhodně přepnout nechystá. Nedávno postavil byty pro zaměstnance, aby přilákal ty kvalitní. Nyní se chce zaměřit na vzdělávání a buduje vlastní učiliště. Také zakladatel skupiny Fenix Cyril Svozil, který letos oslaví sedmdesátku, reaguje na dotazy související s věkem zpočátku pobaveně a lehce dotčeně. \"Ani mě zatím nenapadlo o věku příliš přemýšlet,\" říká majitel firmy s obratem dvě miliardy korun. Následně však připouští, že už musel z pracovního nasazení přece jen trochu ubrat. \"Dřív jsem trávil většinu času na cestách, teď už mám poslední tři nebo čtyři roky problém vyspat se v cizím prostředí,\" vysvětluje, proč cestování omezil na nutné minimum. A může si to dovolit, protože řízení byznysu už převzaly děti. Největší firmu skupiny Fenix Trading, s níž je spojena většina cest, má pár let na starosti dcera Kateřina Jezerská, šéfování celého holdingu se na začátku letošního roku ujal syn Cyril Svozil mladší. Daleké cesty nelákají ani Vlastislava Břízu, majitele a generálního ředitele holdingu Koh-i-noor Hardtmuth. \"Potřeboval bych letět pracovně do Bangladéše, kdyby mi bylo padesát, už sedím v letadle, ale v mém věku se mi nechce,\" přiznává 77letý podnikatel. Zvažuje, že se do cílové destinace vydá s mezipřistáním v Dubaji, kde si dva dny odpočine a pak bude pokračovat. V Česku spadá pod holding Koh-i-noor Hardtmuth celkem 28 společností, dalších pět pak v cizině. Dříve Bříza do všech pravidelně osobně jezdil. \"Teď už třeba do Broumova zamířím maximálně jednou za rok,\" popisuje. Má ale ve výrobních závodech kamery, takže každý den sleduje, co se v holdingu děje. \"O firmě mám dokonalý přehled,\" podotýká. Bříza připouští, že bez moderní techniky by byl v mnohem horší pozici. \"Operativní řízení firem se v poslední době výrazně změnilo. Lidé si to často neuvědomují, ale nové technologie nahrávají starším šéfům,\" myslí si Bříza. Vedle kontrol výroby prostřednictvím kamer je dnes běžné uspořádat poradu nebo konferenci ve virtuálním prostředí. \"Ještě před covidem jsem skoro každé dva dny provázel nějakou delegaci naším výrobním závodem. Dneska nikdo nepřijede, na všechno máme videokonference,\" říká. Během covidových restrikcí se totiž ukázalo, že řadu administrativy i schůzek lze nahradit dálkovým přístupem. Není to sice tak osobní, ale zase rychlejší, levnější a pohodlnější. A jak se ukazuje, moderní technologie udržují ve hře i starší manažery. Vedle snížené ochoty cestovat přiznávají někteří sedmdesátníci v čele firem i určitý úbytek sil. \"V průběhu života se dostáváte na vrchol. Ale cesta z vrcholu vede prostě z kopce, ať se vám to líbí, nebo ne,\" podotýká Vlastislav Bříza s tím, že nejvýkonnější byl v padesáti a za vrchol své kariéry považuje dobu zhruba před deseti lety, kdy se stal Podnikatelem roku a získal i další ceny. \"Po sedmdesátce si na vás už nikdo nevzpomene. Možná tak s oceněním in memoriam,\" vtipkuje. Bříza nepracuje méně než dříve, jen dbá na odpočinek. \"Jdu se občas projít, snažím se pohybovat, každý rok jedu na tři týdny do lázní,\" popisuje s tím, že se drží sokolského hesla \"Ve zdravém těle, zdravý duch\". V létě jezdí na kole, teď o víkendu si byl v Rakousku zalyžovat. \"Na svahu už prostě nejezdím 90 kilometrů v hodině, ale jen padesát,\" popisuje Bříza, jak bere ohled na svůj vyšší věk. Šediny a přibývající roky přinášejí také řadu výhod. Mnozí z šéfů si pochvalují, že kolem šedesátky získali větší nadhled, předvídavost a lépe zvládají konflikty. Cyril Svozil oceňuje, že s věkem získal větší sebejistotu a uvážlivost. \"Do 35 let většinou člověk vidí svět černobíle, buď je něco pravda, nebo lež, pak s věkem začnou přibývat odstíny šedé. A musím říct, že po šedesátce se mi svět vybarvil,\" přiznává. Díky tomu je k podřízeným a spolupracovníkům tolerantnější. Vede je méně direktivně než zamlada. \"Snažím se poznat jejich silné a slabé stránky, ty první zkouším posilovat, druhé omezovat,\" vysvětluje. Změna přístupu podle Svozila souvisí s tím, že jak člověk stárne, a je navíc úspěšný, získává sebejistotu. \"Když ji máte, rozhodujete s daleko větší uvážlivostí,\" podotýká. Člověk pak podle něj nevidí jen dobré a špatné řešení, ale hledá i další alternativy. \"Většina křečovitých špatných rozhodnutí pramení právě z nejistoty,\" myslí si Svozil. S vyšším věkem se také snaží přistupovat jinak k řešení konfliktů. Vyhýbá se dohadům kvůli malichernostem. A zkouší navíc dosáhnout cíle jinak než striktním nařizováním a přikazováním. \"Taky jsem si uvědomil, že je lepší řešit i sporné záležitosti hned, jak se objeví, a v klidu. Nemá smysl čekat, až někdo vybuchne,\" říká Svozil. K silným stránkám starších manažerů a šéfů patří podle Agnieszky Pietrasik, ředitelky personální společnosti Hays pro Česko, zejména rozsáhlé praktické zkušenosti. Z nich podle svých slov těží třeba Vlastislav Bříza. \"Zkušenosti sbírám roky. Když jsem podepisoval nějakou investici, vždy jsem se na místo jel podívat a plán té fabriky jsem si v podstatě uložil do hlavy,\" popisuje. Právě léta praxe a studium strojařiny na ČVUT umožňují Břízovi vyniknout v oboru. Důležitá je také schopnost tyto znalosti a dovednosti předávat dětem nebo kolegům. \"Starší manažeři jsou často dobří mentoři,\" upozorňuje Pietrasik. Předávat zkušenosti svým nástupcům, synům a synovci, se snaží i Bříza. \"Bohužel některé jsou nepřenosné,\" podotýká. Zkušenosti považuje za klíčové i headhunter Jan Bubeník ze společnosti Bubenik Partners. Setkal se s požadavkem vlastníka na vyhledání mladého energického manažera. Ale jak se posléze ukázalo, jedna z mála věcí, které nevyčtete v knížkách ani je nemůžete nikde narychlo získat, jsou životní zkušenosti. Nadhled a schopnost předjímat vývoj považuje Bubeník za největší přednost starších šéfů firem a manažerů. \"Dotyčný už bývá dobrý dirigent, ne sólista na jeden nástroj, byť by byl nejlepším virtuosem a zvládal hrát těžké skladby,\" popisuje Bubeník. Starší šéf je podle něj spíše schopný poskládat orchestr z nejlepších hráčů, vytvořit jim dobré podmínky pro práci, sladit je dohromady. \"Úkolem zkušeného šéfa je ostatní inspirovat, vyburcovat nebo v případě potřeby i uklidňovat,\" říká. Nemá podle něj smysl, aby soutěžil s mladými, spíše by měl být schopen využít svoje životní zkušenosti ku prospěchu celku. Rozdíly mezi staršími a mladšími šéfy firem pramení i z odlišností mezi generacemi. \"Každá má své silné stránky, priority, motivace a cíle,\" vysvětluje Jitka Kouba, marketingová ředitelka personální agentury Grafton Recruitment. Z nedávného průzkumu této společnosti například vyplynulo, že manažeři z generace označované baby boomers, kam spadají lidé ve věku 60 až 80 let, jsou známí svým konzervativnějším přístupem a vynikají v odolnosti vůči stresu. Jen tak něco je nerozhodí, takže mohou sloužit jako opora týmu v těžkých časech nebo při práci v časovém presu. \"I když jde o nejzkušenější generaci, její zástupci si cení odborných znalostí a chtějí je dále prohlubovat,\" říká Kouba. Práci mají rádi, a proto nemají problém jí věnovat více času než jiné generace. Nejsou ani tak týmoví hráči, jako spíše individualisté. \"Pracují často sami a výsledky pak rádi předvedou,\" podotýká. Řada kapitánů českého průmyslu nechce ani po sedmdesátce přibrzdit, mnozí považují za zbytečné vybírat a zaučovat nástupce. Třeba Luboš Stoklásek by firmu jednou rád převedl na vnuka, jenže ten není ještě ani plnoletý. \"Když jsem téma nástupnictví před pár lety otevřel s majitelem Juty Jiřím Hlavatým, nechtěl se tím vůbec zabývat,\" říká Bubeník. Sám Hlavatý žádného konkrétního nástupce zatím nepředstavil a stále pracuje naplno, sedm dní v týdnu. Podle Bubeníka je rozhodnutí o odchodu z byznysu individuální záležitost, měla by odrážet, jak se kdo cítí. Jsou podnikatelé, kteří zvládají jet na plný výkon klidně i v sedmdesáti, jsou vitální a energie mají na rozdávání. Jiní připouštějí, že už toho nezvládnou tolik jako dřív. To je třeba případ Cyrila Svozila, který letos řízení skupiny Fenix předal synovi. Sám má nyní ve skupině na starosti inovace, spolupráci se školami nebo zajímavé projekty. \"Teď dělám jen věci, které mě baví, takže mě práce tolik neunavuje,\" říká a zdůrazňuje, že ho vyčerpávaly zejména záležitosti spojené s Green Dealem. \"Měl jsem rád dobu svobodného podnikání, kdy jsem řešil, co vyvineme pro zákazníky,\" říká a vysvětluje, že v přeregulovaném a přebyrokratizovaném světě se mu podnikat už ani příliš nechtělo. Někteří šéfové firem však po šedesátce nebo o něco později z výkonných funkcí odcházejí. Zakladatel a majitel firmy Linet Zbyněk Frolík, kterému je sedmdesát, se z byznysu stáhl a prohlásil, že chce čas trávit hlavně s manželkou a vynahradit jí čas za roky, kdy byl celé dny ve firmě. Kousek od chorvatského Šibeniku si pořídili domek u moře, kam chtějí na část roku přesídlit. Svého nástupce pro řízení firmy Tomáše Koláře vybral už dříve a pozici generálního ředitele opustil v 65 letech. Firmu však Frolík neprodal. Pokud ovšem podnikatel roky budovaný byznys prodá a skočí ze dne na den do plného důchodu, může se to negativně odrazit na jeho celkové kondici. \"Stýkám se i s dalšími zakladateli firem a nejrychleji zestárli ti, kteří podnik prodali,\" popisuje Svozil. Dotyční sice měli najednou čas a prostředky na cestování, ale prudká změna rutiny jim neprospěla. \"Jsou to úplně jiní lidé,\" podotýká. Problémy může působit i situace, kdy má starší majitel firmy pocit, že je v nejlepší kondici, ale řízení byznysu už reálně nezvládá. Nepřipouští si to a předat firmu buď nechce, nebo nemá komu. Pak firmu odsoudí k pomalému úpadku. Některé firmy si právě z důvodu klesající výkonnosti ve vyšším věku hlídají, aby na klíčových postech nebyli manažeři starší šedesáti let. Proto musela například před časem v poradenské společnosti EY skončit Magdalena Souček a Zdeněk Tůma zase opustil KPMG. Podle Bubeníka je potřeba myslet i na to, co by pro firmu znamenala náhlá nemoc nebo smrt šéfa. \"Pokud je dotyčný jediným jednatelem nebo člověkem s podpisovými právy, může být firma paralyzovaná. Najednou nelze odeslat peníze,\" říká. Vzpomíná na dobu covidu, kdy se dokonce stávalo, že majitel zemřel a firma musela do likvidace, protože než bylo ukončeno dědické řízení, nešlo s ní žádným způsobem nakládat. Pokud není vyjasněno nástupnictví, hrozí soudní spory, paralyzování firmy a s tím spojené dodatečné výdaje. \"Většinou se rodina pohádá, takže místo aby majetek zlepšoval život, vypukne o něj boj a rodina se často i rozpadne,\" podotýká Bubeník. Upozorňuje, že je vhodnější mít závěť. \"I když je rozdělení majetku asymetrické, ale vychází z vůle zemřelého, ostatní členové rodiny to většinou přijmou,\" říká. Pokud ale žádný dokument neexistuje, po smrti zakladatele firmy většinou začínají spory o majetek. \"Kromě rodiny se do nich pletou přivdaní a přiženění partneři, jejich právníci, daňaři,\" vyjmenovává Bubeník. Podle něj je odpovědností majitele firmy, aby ještě za života své majetkové záležitosti nějakým způsobem uspořádal. \"Je to bezpečnější jak pro firmu, tak pro rodinu,\" podotýká. Populace stárne, časem by se v Česku mohlo chodit do důchodu až na prahu sedmdesátky. Podnikatelé a majitelé firem, kteří se svého byznysu nechtějí vzdát ani ve vyšším věku, jsou svého druhu průkopníci. Příklady ze světového byznysu ukazují, že úspěšně podnikat a řídit firmu lze i v mnohem vyšším věku. V čele investiční společnosti Berkshire Hathaway stojí americký miliardář Warren Buffett, kterému je 93 let. Firmě to zjevně svědčí. Loni dosáhla rekordního čistého zisku ve výši 96 miliard dolarů. Není bez zajímavosti, že v letošním dopise akcionářům Buffett připomněl Charlieho Mungera, který zemřel loni ve věku 99 let a byl jeho pravou rukou. Dalším rekordmanem je mediální magnát Rupert Murdoch, který v březnu oslavil 93. narozeniny. Přitom až do loňského podzimu řídil společnosti Fox Corporation i News Corporation. V čele obou firem ho vystřídal syn Lachlan. Až do 94 let zastával pozici generálního ředitele Helmut Claas, majitel německé firmy Claas, vyrábějící zemědělskou techniku. Zemřel před třemi lety. Právě Classe si za vzor bere v úvodu zmíněný Lubomír Stoklásek. Ačkoliv jeho plán pracovat dalších dvacet let, tedy do 94 let, vypadá na první pohled bláznivě, příklady úspěšných seniorních byznysmenů ze světa ukazují, že by to vyjít mohlo. \n\n            Centrum.cz\n        \n         | \n        Atlas.cz 1999 – 2024 © Economia, a.s.\n         | \n        \n            O nás\n        \n         | \n        \n            Všechny služby\n        \n         | \n        \n            Volná místa\n        \n \n\n            Inzerce\n        \n         | \n        \n            Služby firmám\n        \n         | \n        \n            Všeobecné podmínky\n        \n         | \n        \n            Cookies\n        \n         | \n        \n            Nastavení soukromí\n        \n         | \n        \n            Ochrana osobních údajů\n        \n         | \n        \n            Zpracování osobních údajů\n        \n         | \n        \n            Audiovizuální mediální služby\n        \n         | \n        \n            Nápověda\n        \n \n        Jakékoliv užití obsahu, včetně převzetí článků, je bez souhlasu Economia, a.s. zapovězeno.\n        \n        Bez souhlasu Economia, a.s. je zapovězeno též rozmnožování obsahu pro účely automatizované analýzy textů nebo dat podle ustanovení § 39c autorského zákona.\n    "

    "description": "BNSF Railway, sediada no Texas, enfrenta acusações de negligência e homicídio culposo por não ter controlado as nuvens de poeira contaminada",
    "published_at": "2024-04-07T13:50:36Z",
    "content": " Por Associated Press — Montana    07/04/2024 10h50    Atualizado  07/04/2024       Paul Resch lembra-se de ter jogado beisebol quando criança em um campo construído com vermiculita (espécie de areia) contaminada por amianto, a poucos metros dos trilhos da ferrovia, onde os trens levantavam nuvens de poeira ao transportar o material contaminado de uma mina no topo de uma montanha pela cidade de Libby, no noroeste de Montana. Ele gostava de entrar em depósitos de vermiculita em um pátio ferroviário adjacente, para capturar pombos que ele alimentava durante os longos dias passados nos trilhos ao longo do rio Kootenai.   Hoje, Resch, 61 anos, está lutando contra uma doença relacionada ao amianto que deixou cicatrizes graves em seu pulmão esquerdo. Ele se cansa facilmente e sabe que não há cura para uma doença que pode sufocá-lo com o tempo.   \"Em algum momento, provavelmente todo mundo foi exposto a isso\", disse ele, falando da vermiculita contaminada com amianto. \"Havia pilhas dela ao longo dos trilhos da ferrovia. ... Havia nuvens de poeira soprando pelo centro da cidade.\"   Quase 25 anos depois que as autoridades federais, em resposta a notícias sobre mortes e doenças, chegaram a Libby, uma cidade com cerca de 3.000 habitantes perto da fronteira entre os EUA e o Canadá, algumas vítimas do amianto e seus familiares estão tentando responsabilizar publicamente uma das principais empresas envolvidas na tragédia: a BNSF Railway.   Centenas de pessoas morreram e mais de 3.000 ficaram doentes devido à exposição ao amianto na área de Libby, de acordo com pesquisadores e autoridades de saúde. A BNSF, sediada no Texas, enfrenta acusações de negligência e homicídio culposo por não ter controlado as nuvens de poeira contaminada que costumavam sair do pátio ferroviário e se instalar nos bairros de Libby. A vermiculita era transportada por trem de Libby para ser usada como isolamento em residências e empresas em todos os EUA.   O primeiro julgamento entre o que os advogados dizem ser centenas de ações judiciais contra a BNSF por seu suposto papel na poluição da comunidade de Libby está programado para começar nesta segunda-feira. Os advogados da ferrovia - de propriedade da Berkshire Hathaway Inc., de Warren Buffett - negam a responsabilidade.   Resch trabalha em uma concessionária de automóveis em Libby e sua esposa está listada como autora em um processo pendente contra a BNSF no tribunal de reivindicações de amianto de Montana. Ele não tem certeza se sua doença foi causada pelo pátio ferroviário. A pista de atletismo da escola secundária de Libby incluía vermiculita contaminada, assim como o isolamento das paredes e sótãos das casas em que ele entrou durante suas duas décadas como bombeiro voluntário.   Os demandantes do próximo julgamento contra a BNSF, as propriedades de Joyce Walder e Thomas Wells, moravam perto do pátio ferroviário de Libby e se mudaram há décadas. Ambos morreram de mesotelioma, um raro câncer de pulmão causado pelo amianto que é desproporcionalmente comum em Libby.   A mina de vermiculita a vários quilômetros de distância fechou em 1990. Nove anos depois, a Agência de Proteção Ambiental chegou a Libby. A limpeza subsequente custou cerca de US$ 600 milhões, sendo a maior parte coberta pelo dinheiro do contribuinte. Ela ainda está em andamento, mas as autoridades dizem que os volumes de amianto no ar do centro de Libby são menores do que quando a mina estava em operação.   A conscientização sobre os perigos do amianto cresceu significativamente nos anos seguintes e, no mês passado, a EPA proibiu os últimos usos industriais remanescentes do amianto nos EUA.   A proibição não incluiu o tipo de fibra de amianto encontrado em Libby nem abordou o chamado amianto \"legado\" que já se encontra em residências, escolas e empresas. Uma análise do governo sobre os riscos remanescentes, há muito esperada, deverá ser apresentada até 1º de dezembro.   O amianto não queima e resiste à corrosão, o que o torna duradouro no meio ambiente. As pessoas que inalam as fibras em forma de agulha podem ter problemas de saúde até 40 anos após a exposição. As autoridades de saúde esperam ter que lidar com casos recém-diagnosticados de doenças causadas pelo amianto por décadas.   Durante um ano de limpeza do pátio ferroviário de Libby, que começou em 2003, as equipes escavaram quase todo o pátio, removendo cerca de 18.000 toneladas de solo contaminado. Em 2020, a BNSF assinou um decreto de consentimento com as autoridades federais resolvendo seu trabalho de limpeza em Libby, na cidade vizinha de Troy e ao longo de 42 milhas (68 quilômetros) de direito de passagem da ferrovia.   No ano passado, a BNSF ganhou um processo federal contra uma clínica de tratamento de amianto em Libby que, segundo um júri, apresentou 337 falsas alegações de amianto que tornaram os pacientes elegíveis para o Medicare e outros benefícios. O juiz que supervisionou o caso ordenou que o Center for Asbestos Related Disease pagasse quase US$ 6 milhões em multas e indenizações, forçando a instalação à falência. Ele continua a operar com uma equipe reduzida.   Algumas vítimas do amianto viram o caso como uma manobra para desacreditar a clínica e minar as ações judiciais contra a ferrovia.   Nos meses que antecederam o julgamento desta semana, os advogados da BNSF tentaram repetidamente desviar a culpa da empresa, inclusive apontando para as ações da W.R. Grace and Co. que foi proprietária da mina de 1963 até seu fechamento. Eles também questionaram se outras fontes de amianto poderiam ter causado as doenças dos reclamantes e sugeriram que Walder e Wells estariam invadindo a propriedade da ferrovia.   O juiz do Tribunal Distrital dos EUA, Brian Morris, impediu a BNSF de culpar a conduta de outros como forma de escapar da responsabilidade. Ele também disse que a lei não apóia a noção de que a invasão de propriedade reduz o dever do proprietário de não causar danos.   Morris ainda não emitiu uma decisão definitiva sobre outra questão jurídica importante: a alegação da ferrovia de que sua obrigação de transportar mercadorias para clientes pagantes a isenta de responsabilidade.   Os autores da ação argumentam que o pátio ferroviário no meio de Libby foi usado para armazenamento e não para transporte, o que significa que a ferrovia não está isenta. A ferrovia construiu uma instalação de carregamento perto da mina, realizou análises econômicas das operações de vermiculita e ajudou a comercializar e desenvolver novos usos para o material, disseram os autores da ação.   A Suprema Corte de Montana decidiu, em um caso separado, que a BNSF e seus antecessores estavam mais envolvidos na mina do que simplesmente transportar seu produto. A poluição em Libby levou a ações civis de milhares de pessoas que trabalharam na mina ou para a ferrovia, seus familiares e outras pessoas da região. A BNSF resolveu alguns processos anteriores por valores não revelados, disseram os advogados dos reclamantes.   Outras entidades pagaram acordos substanciais.

    "title": "What To Watch As First-Quarter 2024 Earnings Season Begins",
    "description": "With this season expected to mark trough earnings growth for the year, earnings guidance will be closely watched. The CPI and PPI reports will impact Fed rate cut timing.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-07T11:00:00Z",
    "content": "This week kicks off the first quarter earnings season, with the primary focus on bank earnings.  Another quarter of modest growth is expected for this earnings season. Earnings are slated to increase by 3.5% year-over-year, and topline sales are also expected to grow by 3.5%. The pace of inflation has ticked up a bit, but the differential between input costs and pricing is expected to keep profit margins steady. Forward earnings guidance will be crucial as the first quarter is forecasted to be the slowest earnings growth of the year. S&P 500 Earnings Estimates Ten S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report earnings this week to kick off the earnings season, but the primary focus will be bank earnings. There are a handful of other companies on the calendar, like Delta Air Lines\nDAL\n (DAL), BlackRock\nBLK\n (BLK), and Progressive\nPGR\n (PGR). Among the banks reporting are JPMorgan Chase\nJPM\n (JPM), Citigroup\nC\n (C), Wells Fargo\nWFC\n (WFC), and State Street (STT). According to FactSet, while the consensus year-over-year earnings estimates for financials call for growth of 1.7%, the banks within the sector are expected to post a decline of 18%. The pace of loan growth has been weak, which should weigh on earnings. Credit losses continue normalizing, so the banks will likely increase reserves to prepare for future losses. Investment banking and wealth management revenues should have benefitted from strong markets. Bank stocks have suffered recently as the odds of a June Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut have declined. Outside the banks, insurance companies should post strong earnings growth at 37% with benefits from easier comparisons, improved loss ratios, and higher yields. Bank Loans: Year-Over-Year Change The communications services sector should report the most robust year-over-year earnings growth at 19.4%. Meta Platforms\nFB\n (META) is expected to be the most significant contributor to the increase, as the company faces easy comparisons and improved earnings. The consumer discretionary sector is expected to post outsized year-over-year earnings growth at 16%. This increase is primarily due to Amazon\nAMZN\n.com (AMZN), which is expected to grow year-over-year earnings per share from $0.31 to $0.83. Since Amazon is over 20% of the total market capitalization of the sector, its results have an outsized influence on the industry. According to FactSet, if Amazon were excluded from the calculation, the consumer discretionary sector would expect a 2.7% year-over-year decline in earnings for the quarter. Several retailers, like Lululemon Athletica\nLULU\n (LULU) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA), have issued disappointing guidance based on more fickle consumer spending despite the robust labor market, so the actual results in this sector will be closely watched. 1Q 2024 Estimated Sector Earnings While oil has stabilized, natural gas prices are sharply lower year-over-year, resulting in the most significant expected declines in year-over-year sector revenues for the materials and energy industries. With the contraction in sales, energy and materials companies will likely have the largest year-over-year decline in earnings this quarter. Energy Commodities Price Changes Despite the continued plunge in profits due to falling energy prices, two of Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRKA, BRKB) largest publicly traded stock holdings are Occidental Petroleum\nOXY\n (OXY) and Chevron\nCVX\n (CVX). Berkshire had amassed an over 28% stake in Occidental as of February. A previous piece discussed why Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway favors Occidental Petroleum. 1Q 2024 Sector Revenue Estimates Sales growth is typically closely tied to nominal GDP growth, combining after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Solid economic activity in the first quarter should support revenue growth. This economic growth supports the consensus estimate of a 3.5% year-over-year sales increase for the S&P 500 and should provide some upside. GDP Growth Supports S&P 500 Sales Though it has recently bounced higher, inflation has been trending lower since mid-2022, which should help earnings again this quarter. Inflation can threaten unit sales and pressure companies to raise prices or risk lower profit margins as their costs rise. U.S. CPI Year-Over-Year Looking at the differential in price growth for producer’s inputs (PPI) versus the price increases hitting consumers indicates that profit margins should be able to hold steady this quarter. The topline sales growth, helped by solid economic activity in the quarter and stable margin pressures, allows positive year-over-year earnings growth expectations. S&P 500 Margins The U.S. dollar should have little impact on multinational companies this quarter. With approximately 40% of the sales of S&P 500 companies coming from international sources, the dollar can impact profits for companies selling products internationally. Dollar Neutral Federal Reserve Chair Powell’s rate-cut-friendly comments after the Fed meeting on March 20 sent market odds to an 85% chance of a Fed easing in June. The strong jobs report on Friday threw more cold water on the optimism, and the odds of a June cut currently sit at around 55%. The probabilities still favor a June or July start to the Federal Reserve’s short-term interest rate cuts. Fed Fund futures are looking for two to three cuts of 25 basis points (0.25%) each in 2024. Fed Rate Cut Probability The low single-digit year-over-year earnings gains for the first quarter seem likely to be exceeded, assisted by topline sales fed by resilient economic growth. With the first quarter expected to be the trough earnings growth for the year, much attention will be paid to management’s future earnings guidance. In addition to the start of earnings season this week, consumer (CPI) and producer (PPI) inflation readings will be closely watched for the impact on the timing of Fed rate cuts. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Citigroup (C), Amazon.com (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA, BRKB), Wells Fargo (WFC), Meta Platforms (META), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), and Chevron (CVX) within its recommended investment strategies.

    "content": "Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Hundreds of people have died and more have been sickened from asbestos exposure in the Libby, Montana area. BNSF Railway faces accusations of wrongful death for failing to control clouds of contaminated dust. The railroad denies the charges. (AP video by Matthew Brown/Production by Thomas Peipert)                 LIBBY, Mont. (AP) — Paul Resch remembers playing baseball as a kid on a field constructed from asbestos-tainted vermiculite, mere yards from railroad tracks where trains kicked up clouds of dust as they hauled the contaminated material from a mountaintop mine through the northwestern Montana town of Libby. He liked to sneak into vermiculite-filled storage bins at an adjacent rail yard, to trap pigeons that he would feed, during long days spent by the tracks along the Kootenai River. Today, Resch, 61, is battling an asbestos-related disease that has severely scarred his left lung. He’s easily winded, quickly tires and knows there is no cure for an illness that could suffocate him over time. “At some point, probably everybody got exposed to it,” he said, speaking of asbestos-tainted vermiculite. “There was piles of it along the railroad tracks. ... You would get clouds of dust blowing around downtown.” Almost 25 years after federal authorities responding to news reports of deaths and illnesses descended on Libby, a town of about 3,000 people near the U.S.-Canada border, some asbestos victims and their family members are seeking to hold publicly accountable one of the major corporate players in the tragedy: BNSF Railway. Hundreds of people died and more than 3,000 have been sickened from asbestos exposure in the Libby area, according to researchers and health officials. Texas-based BNSF faces accusations of negligence and wrongful death for failing to control clouds of contaminated dust that used to swirl from the rail yard and settle across Libby’s neighborhoods. \n The vermiculite was shipped by rail from Libby for use as insulation in homes and businesses across the U.S. The first trial among what attorneys say are hundreds of lawsuits against BNSF for its alleged role polluting the Libby community is scheduled to begin Monday.  The railroad — owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. — has denied responsibility in court filings and declined further comment. Resch works at an auto dealership in Libby and his wife is listed as a plaintiff in a pending lawsuit against BNSF in Montana’s asbestos claims court. He’s uncertain whether his sickness came from the rail yard. The Libby high school track included contaminated vermiculite, as did insulation in the walls and attics of homes he entered during his two decades as a volunteer firefighter.  The plaintiffs for the upcoming trial against BNSF, the estates of Joyce Walder and Thomas Wells, lived near the Libby rail yard and moved away decades ago. Both died in 2020 of mesothelioma, a rare lung cancer caused by asbestos that is disproportionately common in Libby. The mine a few miles outside town once produced up to 80% of global vermiculite supplies. It closed in 1990. Nine years later, the Environmental Protection Agency arrived in Libby and a subsequent cleanup has cost an estimated $600 million, with most covered by taxpayer money. It’s ongoing, but authorities say asbestos volumes in downtown Libby’s air are 100,000 times lower than when the mine was operating. Awareness about the dangers of asbestos grew significantly over the intervening years, and last month the EPA banned the last remaining industrial uses of asbestos in the U.S. The ban did not include the type of asbestos fiber found in Libby or address so-called “legacy” asbestos that’s already in homes, schools and businesses. A long-awaited government analysis of the remaining risks is due by Dec. 1. Asbestos doesn’t burn and resists corrosion, making it long lasting in the environment. People who inhale the needle-shaped fibers can develop health problems as many as 40 years after exposure. Health officials expect to grapple with newly diagnosed cases of asbestos disease for decades. The EPA declared the nation’s first ever public health emergency under the Superfund cleanup program in Libby in 2009. The pollution led to civil claims from thousands of people who worked for the mine or the railroad, or who lived in the Libby area. During a yearslong cleanup of the Libby rail yard that began in 2003, crews excavated nearly the entire yard, removing about 18,000 tons of contaminated soil. In 2020, BNSF signed a consent decree with federal authorities resolving its cleanup work in Libby and nearby Troy, plus a 42-mile stretch (68 kilometers) of railroad right-of-way. Last year, BNSF won a federal lawsuit against an asbestos treatment clinic in Libby that a jury found submitted 337 false asbestos claims, making patients eligible for Medicare and other benefits. The judge overseeing the case ordered the Center for Asbestos Related Disease to pay almost $6 million in penalties and damages, forcing the facility into bankruptcy. It continues to operate with reduced staff. Some asbestos victims viewed the case as a ploy to discredit the clinic and undermine lawsuits against the railroad. BNSF said the verdict would deter “future misconduct” by the clinic. In the months leading up to this week’s trial, attorneys for BNSF repeatedly tried to deflect blame for people getting sick, including by pointing to the actions of W.R. Grace and Co., which owned the mine from 1963 until it closed. They also questioned whether other asbestos sources could have caused the two plaintiffs’ illnesses and suggested Walder and Wells would have been trespassing on railroad property. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris blocked BNSF from blaming the conduct of others as a means of escaping liability. And he said the law doesn’t support the notion that trespassing reduces a property owner’s duty not to cause harm. Morris has yet to issue a definitive ruling on another key issue: the railroad’s claim that its obligation to ship goods for paying customers exempts it from liability.  The plaintiffs argue the rail yard in downtown Libby — where Resch once played in piles of vermiculite — was used for storage and not just transportation, meaning the railroad is not exempt. Montana’s Supreme Court has ruled in a separate case that BNSF and its predecessors were more involved in the mine than simply shipping its product.  Mine owner W.R. Grace filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and paid $1.8 billion into an asbestos trust fund to settle future cases. It paid about $270 million to government agencies for environmental damages and cleanup work. The state of Montana was also faulted in Libby, for failing to warn residents about asbestos exposure. It paid settlements totaling $68 million to about 2,000 plaintiffs. BNSF has settled some previous lawsuits for undisclosed amounts, attorneys for plaintiffs said. A second trial against the railroad over the death of a Libby resident is scheduled for May in federal court in Missoula. “I sure hope that they give those folks justice,” Resch said about the upcoming trials. “I mean everybody took part in it as far as corporate America goes.” ___ This story has been corrected to reflect the proper spelling of Warren Buffett’s last name.

Resch works at an auto dealership in Libby and his wife is listed as a plaintiff in a pending lawsuit against BNSF in Montana's asbestos claims court. He's uncertain whether his sickness came from the rail yard. The Libby high school track included contaminated vermiculite, as did insulation in the walls and attics of homes he entered during his two decades as a volunteer firefighter. The plaintiffs for the upcoming trial against BNSF, the estates of Joyce Walder and Thomas Wells, lived near the Libby rail yard and moved away decades ago. Both died in 2020 of mesothelioma, a rare lung cancer caused by asbestos that is disproportionately common in Libby. The mine a few miles outside town once produced up to 80% of global vermiculite supplies. It closed in 1990. Nine years later, the Environmental Protection Agency arrived in Libby and a subsequent cleanup has cost an estimated $600 million, with most covered by taxpayer money. It's ongoing, but authorities say asbestos volumes in downtown Libby's air are 100,000 times lower than when the mine was operating. Awareness about the dangers of asbestos grew significantly over the intervening years, and last month the EPA banned the last remaining industrial uses of asbestos in the U.S. The ban did not include the type of asbestos fiber found in Libby or address so-called “legacy” asbestos that's already in homes, schools and businesses. A long-awaited government analysis of the remaining risks is due by Dec. 1. Asbestos doesn’t burn and resists corrosion, making it long lasting in the environment. People who inhale the needle-shaped fibers can develop health problems as many as 40 years after exposure. Health officials expect to grapple with newly diagnosed cases of asbestos disease for decades. The EPA declared the nation’s first ever public health emergency under the Superfund cleanup program in Libby in 2009. The pollution led to civil claims from thousands of people who worked for the mine or the railroad, or who lived in the Libby area. During a yearslong cleanup of the Libby rail yard that began in 2003, crews excavated nearly the entire yard, removing about 18,000 tons of contaminated soil. In 2020, BNSF signed a consent decree with federal authorities resolving its cleanup work in Libby and nearby Troy, plus a 42-mile stretch (68 kilometers) of railroad right-of-way. Last year, BNSF won a federal lawsuit against an asbestos treatment clinic in Libby that a jury found submitted 337 false asbestos claims, making patients eligible for Medicare and other benefits. The judge overseeing the case ordered the Center for Asbestos Related Disease to pay almost $6 million in penalties and damages, forcing the facility into bankruptcy. It continues to operate with reduced staff. Some asbestos victims viewed the case as a ploy to discredit the clinic and undermine lawsuits against the railroad. BNSF said the verdict would deter \"future misconduct” by the clinic. In the months leading up to this week's trial, attorneys for BNSF repeatedly tried to deflect blame for people getting sick, including by pointing to the actions of W.R. Grace and Co., which owned the mine from 1963 until it closed. They also questioned whether other asbestos sources could have caused the two plaintiffs’ illnesses and suggested Walder and Wells would have been trespassing on railroad property. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris blocked BNSF from blaming the conduct of others as a means of escaping liability. And he said the law doesn’t support the notion that trespassing reduces a property owner’s duty not to cause harm. Morris has yet to issue a definitive ruling on another key issue: the railroad’s claim that its obligation to ship goods for paying customers exempts it from liability. The plaintiffs argue the rail yard in downtown Libby — where Resch once played in piles of vermiculite — was used for storage and not just transportation, meaning the railroad is not exempt. Montana's Supreme Court has ruled in a separate case that BNSF and its predecessors were more involved in the mine than simply shipping its product. Mine owner W.R. Grace filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and paid $1.8 billion into an asbestos trust fund to settle future cases. It paid about $270 million to government agencies for environmental damages and cleanup work. The state of Montana was also faulted in Libby, for failing to warn residents about asbestos exposure. It paid settlements totaling $68 million to about 2,000 plaintiffs. BNSF has settled some previous lawsuits for undisclosed amounts, attorneys for plaintiffs said. A second trial against the railroad over the death of a Libby resident is scheduled for May in federal court in Missoula. “I sure hope that they give those folks justice,” Resch said about the upcoming trials. “I mean everybody took part in it as far as corporate America goes.” ___ This story has been corrected to reflect the proper spelling of Warren Buffett's last name.

A bearish signal all around? Warren Buffett took hours of questions from shareholders on Saturday for the first time since the passing of his right-hand man, Charlie Munger. This year’s Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting marked a new era for the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett. It’s the investing legend’s first without his right-hand man, Charlie Munger.

    "description": "From vehicles to chips to banks to chocolate, a variety of industries could see volatility as shareholder meeting season kicks into high gear",
    "published_at": "2024-04-08T20:31:46Z",
    "content": "Companies have faced a range of challenges over the past two-plus years. Following the 2021 boom driven by intense fiscal and monetary stimulus, along with the subsequent dramatic rise in interest rates throughout 2022, last year was tough at the macro level as corporate profit growth stalled. But the fourth-quarter reporting season underscored just how strong large multinational companies are in producing cash flow and rewarding shareholders. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with STLA. According to Factset, a third-straight quarter of earnings per share growth is the current forecast among S&P 500 companies.[1] We'll know a whole lot more beginning this Friday when the big banks begin posting first-quarter results. Investors will also be curious about dividend and buyback plans now that the earnings recession is clearly in the rearview mirror. Furthermore, capital markets may be turning the corner with a few decent IPOs in recent weeks and M&A activity showing vital signs in some industries. Clues on all these areas are commonly provided at shareholder meetings. At annual events, stockholders vote on important company decisions such as electing board members (we saw the drama on that front last week with Disney (NYSE:DIS)), approving M&A actions and other corporate moves. Shareholder meetings offer a platform for management teams to hear from equity owners big and small while relaying operations plans to the market. The gatherings can become tense, though, when activist investors assert themselves. Enhanced stock price volatility can also come about when major strategy shifts are announced unexpectedly or if surprising financial details are presented. The April through June stretch is the peak season for shareholder meetings. Let's shed light on some of the most notable events that could move individual stocks and drive industry price action. There's even a sweet treat at the end. April 16: Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) The auto OEM space is in flux. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported very weak March EV numbers and a tepid outlook while Ford (NYSE:F) posted solid year-on-year hybrid sales.[2] Investors may get a glimpse of how the situation has unfolded at Stellantis after a tumultuous second half of 2023 recall last year's labor strikes and an eventual agreement reached between workers and management. Then in March, Stellantis reported that it will cut 400 tech jobs, so all may not be so well with the U.S. automaker.[3] Looking ahead, rival Ford's shareholder meeting is slated for May 9. April 22: Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Powering markets higher last year and during the early part of 2023 was the semiconductor area. Broadcom is seen as the little sibling of sorts to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), but the former's 100%-plus return over the past 12 months is no sleeper among momentum traders. The AI infrastructure buildout player's shareholder meeting could provide further details about the chip industry's growth trajectory. The company's second-quarter earnings release doesn't come until June 12. April 24: ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) Keeping on the semiconductor theme, the third-largest non-U.S. stock hosts its shareholder meeting just two days after Broadcom's.[4] The Dutch company, part of Goldman's vaunted GRANOLAS trade, is also a beneficiary of the AI boom.[5] Strong EPS growth is expected this year, but shares trade at a lofty forward earnings multiple.[6] Any financial updates presented could move the stock as well as European equity ETFs. April 24: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Broadening out, Bank of America's shareholder event comes just eight days after the release of its first-quarter profit report. CEO Brian Moynihan has navigated volatile financial and capital markets okay, but the bank's one-year stock performance pales in comparison to peer JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM). Be on the lookout for comments about consumer spending and risk appetite among institutions at the event. Money Center banks would benefit from more active capital markets as the year unfolds, so say analysts at Morgan Stanley, but much uncertainty remains.[7] April 30: Citigroup (NYSE:C) Citi's shareholder gathering takes place the following Tuesday after its April 12 first-quarter report. CEO Jane Fraser has been leading a turnaround at the $120 billion market cap bank, and the stock has responded well up 20% year to date. Last month, the industry reported improved credit card delinquencies and a decline in net charge-offs.[8] It comes as card issuers are seen being negatively impacted by a new swipe-fee agreement, potentially having a material impact on revenue.[9] May 1: The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) Speaking of the consumer, volatility could come about on April 30 when Coca-Cola reports first-quarter results. Its annual shareholder meeting occurs the next day on Wednesday, May 1. The stock is down fractionally in the past 12 months, no doubt hurt by the rising popularity of GLP-1 wonder drugs. But Coca-Cola hiked its dividend by more than 5% earlier this year, perhaps a sign that the Consumer Staples stalwart remains a dominant brand around the world.[10] Growth in its Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and EMEA regions helped drive a 7% year-on-year revenue jump, as reported back in February.[11] May 4: Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(BRK.B) The most famous shareholder meeting is arguably the one hosted by the Oracle of Omaha. Woodstock for Capitalists will have a somber tone on the first Saturday in May, however. The event comes after the passing of Charlie Munger, the late vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. Still, value investors will look forward to hearing what Buffett has to say about the state of the economy and what Berkshire plans to do with its growing cash position. First-quarter 2024 earnings are also released at the annual event. May 6: The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) Last but not least, this year's shareholder meeting in Hershey, Pennsylvania might capture more attention following the meteoric rise in cocoa futures in the past three months. Rising from $4,000 to above $10,000 per ton, cocoa topped copper in value last month.[12] Ironically, Hershey shares have been generally rangebound between $180 and $205 since October 2023. Hershey has an unconfirmed first-quarter 2024 earnings date of Thursday, May 2.

    "content": "Warren Buffett is one of the wealthiest people in the world, with a net worth estimated at over $133 billion. Despite his wealth, the legendary investor and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. CEO lives a frugal lifestyle, preferring the simple pleasures of a McDonald’s hamburger over extravagant dining. “I buy everything I want in life,” Buffett said at the 2017 New York City premiere of the documentary “Becoming Warren Buffett,\" according to People.com. “Would 10 homes make me more happy? Possessions possess you at a point. I don’t like a $100 meal as well as a hamburger from McDonald’s. That’s the way I’m put together, I don’t equate the amount I spend with the enjoyment I’m going to get from something.” Don't Miss: Americans got swindled out of $24.6 billion in the last 3 years – here’s how millionaires protect their assets. Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you. This humble approach extends to Buffett’s transportation and housing. In a 2013 CBS News interview, Buffett was spotted driving around his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, in a 2006 Cadillac. While being interviewed by journalist Rebecca Jarvis, he showed off his favorite places in the city, including the local McDonald’s. When Jarvis asked what he typically ordered there, Buffett replied, “Three times out of four, I get the sausage McMuffin. Lunchtime I get the Quarter Pounder and fries.” Despite now driving a more recent 2014 Cadillac model, Buffett has never been one to flaunt his wealth with lavish vehicles. According to his daughter, he looks for hail-damaged cars to get the best deal. The same goes for his living situation. Buffett still resides in the home he purchased in 1958 for $31,500, the equivalent of around $338,000 today — less than the price of the average home in 2024. “I am happy in a pair of khakis and a sweater so I don’t need fancy clothes. I don’t need fancy food,” Buffett said. Buffett’s frugal philosophy extends beyond his personal life. He has pledged to give away 99% of his wealth to philanthropic causes, and he lives on a salary of $100,000 per year from Berkshire Hathaway. For Buffett, his immense wealth is not a source of lavish spending but a responsibility to use it wisely and give back to others. By modeling a life of simplicity and moderation, the Oracle of Omaha shows that true happiness and fulfillment come not from material possessions, but from within. Buffett’s lifestyle offers a valuable lesson: Happiness is not directly proportional to wealth, but securing sufficient funds for a comfortable retirement remains essential. As the bar for retirement savings continues to rise, seeking guidance from a financial adviser gains importance. Such professional advice can help people establish a robust financial strategy, ensuring a worry-free enjoyment of their retirement years.

    "description": "Taiwan Semiconductor's grants and loans will allow the company to build a third factory in Phoenix that will open by the end of the decade.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-08T11:40:16Z",
    "content": "       The White House is giving the world's largest chipmaker government grants and loans worth almost $12 billion to expand production in Arizona. The agreement with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) announced an initial deal in a press release on Monday.  The company is poised to garner as much as $6.6 billion in grants and $5 billion in direct funding from the Biden administration, under the CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022. TSMC generated about $67 billion in revenue last year and and $26 billion of net income.  \n                              Related stories\n                             The semiconductor giant said it would construct a third factory on its Phoenix site that would begin production this decade. Its first facility is on track to go live next year, while the second is under construction and set to be operational in 2028. TSMC, which supplies chips to companies including Apple and Nvidia, now pegs its total commitment to Arizona at $65 billion. The company expects to make new, two-nanometer chips at its third facility that could help power the artificial-intelligence boom. Rivals like Intel, Samsung, and Microchip Technology have either agreed their own funding deals with the government, or are expected to soon. Arizona is set to be a key battleground state in the presidential election. The deal struck between TSMC and the White House could aid Biden's reelection bid, especially as the grant includes funding to train local workers and promises to help create 6,000 manufacturing jobs and 20,000 construction jobs. Both the government and companies in the US are working to lessen their reliance on China's high-tech manufacturing industry after decades of outsourcing. The key reasons include rising US-China tensions, national-security concerns about Chinese access to Western tech, and extended pandemic lockdowns in China that caused painful shortages of key components in the US. TSMC's American Depositary Receipts, which represent shares in the foreign company, have surged 36% this year. They've rallied significantly since Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway amassed a $4 billion stake in the summer of 2022 then promptly dumped the entire position within the next six months. Buffett has explained that China-Taiwan tensions were \"a consideration\" when his conglomerate sold, and his team also found better places to park money. For now, it looks as though TSMC is deepening its foothold in the US as it seeks to become a key domestic supplier of microchips. \n                              Most popular\n                             Jump to"

    "title": "Fresh Thinking On Aging Leaders",
    "description": "As demographics gray the workforce, how old is too old to hold a demanding leadership role?",
    "published_at": "2024-04-09T15:46:36Z",
    "content": "As demographics gray the workforce, how old is too old to hold a demanding leadership role? In the US, there’s an urgent debate underway regarding age that focuses on the capacity of two men—one in his late 70s, the other his early 80s—to handle four more years as the most powerful leader in the world. This isn’t just a political argument. It’s also a critical issue in business, and it’s one that is only going to become more common as people live and work longer. While wisdom certainly grows with age, does the risk of cognitive and physical decline call for upper age limits on more top leadership positions? Before answering this question, it’s important to consider the difference between chronological age and functional age. There is no question about cognitive decline as you age—it is real. It is also true that the pace of change in the world and the degree of volatility has never been higher. This all requires significant flexibility and adaptability. That must be balanced with the value of experience and the wisdom and judgment that comes with that experience. The corner office is aging. According to data from The Conference Board and Esgauge, more than 5% of CEOs of Russell 3000 companies are 70 years old or older, and the percentage who are 65 and older is climbing. At 93, Warren Buffett, who’s been running Berkshire Hathaway since 1970, is the oldest CEO in that group. This may just be the beginning given demographic trends. By 2031, workers age 55 and older will exceed 25% of the workforce of the Group of Seven nations, nearly 10 percentage points higher than in 2011, according to Bain Futures research. In Japan, where I am based, workers 55 and older will approach 40% of the workforce by the end of this decade. This is contributing to later retirement. Forty-one percent of US workers expect to work beyond age 65 today compared with 12% 30 years ago, according to Gallup. There’s a true silver lining to this because older workers are valuable contributors. Age-diverse firms are lower in turnover and higher in productivity than benchmarks, according to OECD research. Older workers are especially motivated by mastering their craft and by having a positive impact on the lives of others, Bain Futures has found, with a service-oriented mindset that can be a valuable corporate asset. In an article in The Atlantic entitled “The Kind of Smarts You Don’t Find in Young People,” Arthur Brooks dives into a distinction psychologists Raymond Cattell and John Horn first made in the 1960s between fluid intelligence, namely, the ability to reason, think, and solve problems with which we are born and which peaks in our 30s, and crystallized intelligence, which we use to solve problems with acquired knowledge and information. Accumulated over a lifetime, crystallized intelligence does not automatically diminish with age, and indeed, it can keep growing. Crystallized intelligence helps us mentor and supervise, explain and teach, and cultivate others, Brooks explains. Even so, many jobs have mandatory retirement ages that have remained unchanged for years. Commercial airline pilots, firefighters, and police officers are among them. Directors, too. Earlier this year, it made headlines when two long-serving members of Apple’s board of directors announced their retirement. Former US Vice President Al Gore and former Boeing CFO James Bell had both turned 75, which is too old to stand for reelection to the tech giant’s board under its rules. According to executive search firm Spencer Stuart, 69% of S&P 500 companies have such mandatory retirement ages for directors. Similar rules are in place for many CEOs, though exceptions can be made. Jim Umpleby of Caterpillar got a job extension in October 2022 when the board cited his strong strategic and operating leadership in announcing that he’d be staying in the role past 65. And in recent years, MetLife, 3M, and Merck have all waived mandatory retirement for their CEO. Clearly, bright-line rules, such as retirement at 65 or 75, aren’t always the answer. Whether someone’s up to a task varies by individual. Putting a blanket requirement on chronological age risks including people who aren’t capable and excluding others who are. In 2022, when Disney rehired Bob Iger as CEO less than a year after he retired, the board called him uniquely situated to lead the company through an increasingly complex period of industry transformation. His age, 71, got little attention. So rather than an aggressive and specific focus on age, it makes more sense to return to the most important questions we should always be asking for leadership appointments.   Conversations about age and retirement are tricky. Maybe that’s why, in a corporate setting, they seem to happen so rarely. Korn Ferry cites survey data from the National Association of Corporate Directors finding that 26% of public companies haven’t established who would step in if the current boss departed suddenly and that 37% of private companies also don’t know who would take over. Even worse, fewer than half of all companies (public or private) have a pipeline of internal candidates who could succeed the current CEO. These are complicated, nuanced questions: questions that boards—and all of us—increasingly will have to consider. "

First quarter earnings season is about to put the breadth of the rally to the test. \"We can always talk about price action and whether, you know, the rally is widening, but at the end of the day, it's about earnings and fundamentals,\" Deutsche Bank chief equity strategist Binky Chadha told Yahoo Finance. First quarter earnings reports will kick off in earnest on Friday with JPMorgan (JPM) and other banks set to release results before the opening bell. Earnings from Delta Air Lines (DAL) will serve as an appetizer on Wednesday. Broadly, consensus sees earnings growing compared to the year prior for a third straight quarter. Consensus expectations are for a 3.2% year-over-year earnings increase for S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies in the first quarter, per FactSet data. Market bulls expect earnings and forward guidance for the rest of the year to show the outlook for corporates is improving despite a continued high interest rate environment. Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon pointed out to Yahoo Finance Live that recent data on economic growth has surprised consensus to the upside, and that likely indicates \"consensus might be too low, especially this earnings season.\" \"We're looking for another strong quarter [of earnings growth],\" Kwon said. Still, the companies driving the overall earnings growth for the S&P 500 aren't expected to shift much this quarter. Research from Goldman Sachs' equity strategy team led by David Kostin shows the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 — primarily the Magnificent Seven — are expected to see earnings grow by 32% in the first quarter. Meanwhile, the other 490 stocks are projected to produce an earnings decline of 4%. Nvidia (NVDA) is the clear leader of the group, with earnings expected to grow 406% compared to the year prior, followed by Amazon's (AMZN) 175% expected growth. Meta (META), Eli Lily (LLY), Alphabet (GOOGL), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B), Microsoft (MSFT), Broadcom (AVGO), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Apple (AAPL) round out the rest of the top 10. This leaves the overall earnings picture for the benchmark index levered to the index's largest corporations once again.‌ Kostin notes that if those companies continue to perform, the likelihood of an \"acute catch down\" — where stocks fall to reprice slower-than-expected earnings growth — is \"relatively slim.\" Instead, bullish investors are looking for a \"catch-up\" scenario in markets where the earnings for the other 490 companies in the S&P 500 start to rebound later in the year. While that trend won't be the clear driver of earnings growth this quarter, Chadha at Deutsche Bank believes there will be signs of a rotation under the surface in earnings growth, backing the recent market narrative that a growing US economy will be a tailwind for stocks outside the tech sector. \"With a cyclical uptake, with the pickup in CEO confidence that we've seen and talked about, you should start to see much better earnings,\" Chadha said. \"You should start to see much better and more confident guidance.\" To be clear, Chadha still sees \"good earnings\" for megacap growth and tech moving forward. But he believes the companies' guidance released this quarter will show some signs of a cooldown from the astronomical earnings growth seen by some large companies in 2023. If this is met by upbeat guidance from the other areas of the market, it would \"continue to encourage\" the rotation seen in markets over the past month with sectors like Energy (XLE), Materials (XLB), and Industrials (XLI) outpacing gains in Technology (XLK) and Communications Services (XLC). Charles Schwab global chief investment strategist Jeffrey Kleintop told Yahoo Finance Live that if first quarter earnings calls indicate a rotation may be underway, that'd be a welcome sign for the health of the stock market rally. He added that the recent pickup in manufacturing activity, which grew at its fastest pace in the US since 2022, shows analyst expectation for an earnings pickup in economic-sensitive sectors is more than \"hope.\" \"It's a second wind for the stock market,\" Kleintop said.

The sale marks the end of an era for 3G. The firm's influence over Kraft Heinz had been dwindling in recent years as its number of board seats slipped from three to none by July 2022. \"3G has not been involved in the management of Kraft Heinz, nor have they been on the Board for several years. They had continued to be an investor and were treated as we do any investor,\" Kraft Heinz said in a statement to CNBC. \"We did learn from their recent filing that 3G exited the Kraft Heinz stock entirely in 2023.\" The company added that Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, its largest shareholder with a 26.8% stake, is a committed long-term owner. 3G did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC. Berkshire and 3G's doomed romance began on Valentine's Day in 2013 when the two firms announced they were teaming up to take Heinz private. The merger with Kraft Foods followed two years later. The new company initially pleased investors with its earnings growth, thanks to its cost-cutting approach favored by 3G. The firm had already found success with that strategy when it created beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev through a series of megamergers and took Burger King private and revived its sales. But the packaged food business presented new challenges. Consumers were shifting to eating more fresh food. Plus, retailers' private-label brands and newcomers touting themselves as a healthier option were stealing Big Food's shoppers. Kraft Heinz sought to drive inorganic growth through a takeover bid for Unilever, but the Popsicle owner rejected its offer. Then a disastrous quarter came for Kraft Heinz in 2019. In a single earnings report, the company slashed its dividend, disclosed a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into its accounting practices and wrote down its brands by $15 billion. Several months later, Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire and 3G overpaid for Kraft Heinz, buoyed by optimism that its brands were more valuable than they actually were. Still, he stood by both 3G and Kraft Heinz. Other investors blamed 3G's aggressive cost cutting for the company's troubles. To reverse the company's downward spiral, 3G handpicked the food giant's new chief executive, an AB InBev veteran, and Kraft Heinz went into turnaround mode. The company announced plans to ramp up its marketing and advertising spending and shift its strategy for making new products. To reduce its exposure to private-label competition, it also sold its cheese business to Lactalis, a French dairy giant, and its Planters nuts brand to Hormel. In 2021, 3G founding partner Jorge Paulo Lemann stepped down from Kraft Heinz's board. The following year, fellow founding partner Alexandre Behring left the board. And two months after Behring's departure, 3G's final board member, former AB InBev CEO Joao Castro-Neves, also stepped down. Kraft Heinz disclosed his departure in a regulatory filing but no press release — or fanfare — accompanied it. 3G had been periodically trimming its stake in Kraft Heinz since 2018. When it sold 25 million shares in 2019, at the height of the company's troubles, the stock fell 4% in response to the disclosure. In 2022, it distributed about 7% of Kraft Heinz to investors in its fund, which reportedly included tennis star Roger Federer. Last year, Kraft Heinz tapped Carlos Abrams-Rivera as its new chief executive. While he's been with the company since 2020, he's notably the company's first CEO without ties to 3G.

    "content": "Companies will have to publish standardized operating profit figures from 2027 under new requirements from a global accounting rulesetter to help end what international investor Warren Buffett has called “misleading” numbers. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) writes book-keeping rules used by about 50,000 companies across 147 countries, but not in the United States, which has its own rules. IASB Chair Andreas Barckow said it marks a significant change by ending the discretion of companies to decide what constitutes operating profit in their income statement that investors rely on. Currently, before arriving at a net profit or loss, many companies report earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, a figure that is not defined under IASB rules and therefore can be compiled in different ways to flatter performance. Investors have called for more rigor to standardize information on operating profit and make comparability easier, Barckow told Reuters. “We need a standardized version so that we can actually base our analysis on the same anchor point.” Warren Buffett, chair of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, has described EBITDA as a “misleading statistic” by failing to include the cost of depreciation. His deputy Charlie Munger, who died in November, called it “bullshit earnings.” The new IASB rules define mandatory sub-totals for operating profit, which will include depreciation, amortization and impairment on goodwill, and profit before financing and income taxes. Common adjustments, such as for currency fluctuations, can only be included in footnotes to the statement. Companies can continue reporting an EBIDTA figure, but only in the footnotes, if it can be reconciled with what’s in the two new mandatory subtotals. Banks and insurers will have to include interest, a key part of their business model, in their operating profit, which some already do. Barckow said companies can use the new rules before statements for 2027 if they want to. U.S. accounting rules are not being reformed in the same way as IASB norms.

    "title": "Montana asbestos victims want Warren Buffett’s railroad company held responsible for thousands exposed to toxic dust",
    "description": "The railroad—now owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway—hauled asbestos-tainted vermiculite from a nearby mine through Libby, Montana, over decades.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-09T08:49:12Z",
    "content": "An attorney for two people who died of a rare lung cancer argued on Monday for a jury to hold BNSF Railway responsible for pollution in a small Montana town near the U.S.-Canada border where thousands of people were exposed to toxic asbestos dust. The railroad — now owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. — hauled asbestos-tainted vermiculite from a nearby mine through Libby, Montana, over decades. How much BNSF knew about the health hazard from those shipments is it at the center of a weekslong civil trial that began Monday. Attorneys for the railroad said it was told repeatedly that the product it was shipping through Libby was safe. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2009 declared the first-ever public health emergency during a Superfund cleanup in Libby. It’s one of the deadliest sites under the federal pollution program. The W.R. Grace & Co. mine that operated most of last century on a mountaintop outside Libby produced contaminated vermiculite that health officials say has sickened more than 3,000 people and led to several hundred deaths. The pollution has been largely cleaned up. Yet the long latency period of asbestos diseases has meant people have continued getting sick with lung problems. The estates of Thomas Wells of LaConner, Oregon, and Joyce Walder of Westminster, California, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against BNSF in 2021. They argue the railroad and its corporate predecessors stored asbestos-laden vermiculite in a large rail yard in Libby — before shipping it to plants across the U.S. where it was heated to expand for use as insulation in millions of homes and businesses. Plaintiffs’ attorney Mark Lanier said the dangers of asbestos were well known by the industry yet BNSF never took steps to warn the people of Libby. He added that W.R. Grace, the mining company, started putting warning signs on its vermiculite rail cars as early as 1977. The trial, Lanier said, was about “did (the railroad) expose Libby residents to wind-born asbestos contamination.” BNSF attorney Chad Knight said the railroad was required under law to accept the vermiculite for shipment and had been told by W.R. Grace that it was safe. The onus was on the shipper to tell the railroad if it was hazardous, Knight said. Numerous other lawsuits alleging BNSF exposed Libby residents to asbestos are pending, court records show. The Walder and Wells lawsuit is the first so-called community exposure case against BNSF to go to trial, almost 25 years after federal authorities arrived in Libby following news reports about widespread deaths and illnesses. People who lived and worked in Libby breathed in the microscopic needle-shaped asbestos fibers that can cause lung scarring and the lung cancer mesothelioma, the lawsuit argues. Wells, 65, died in March 2020, a day after giving a 1/2-hour recorded deposition for the lawsuit. He talked about his exposure during seasonal work for the U.S. Forest Service in the Libby area in late 1970s and early 1980s. Wells said he was diagnosed with mesothelioma in late 2019 after feeling an ache in his back and developing a serious cough. He said the pain was intolerable and that he had to sell his house to help cover medical bills. Walder 66, died in October 2020. She lived in Libby for at least 20 years and could have been exposed to asbestos while fishing and floating on a river that flowed past a spot where vermiculite was loaded onto train cars, according to court records. Her exposure may have also come from playing around a baseball field near the rail yard or walking along the railroad tracks and occasionally heating up pieces of vermiculite to watch it puff up, the records said. The trial, presided over by U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris, is expected to last three weeks. BNSF said in court documents filed in advance of the trial that when low levels of asbestos were found in the Libby rail yard during testing in 2001, the railroad cleaned up the site to protect its employees. But an expert for the plaintiffs said BNSF and its predecessors sponsored geologic reports in the area and knew as early as the 1920s that the vermiculite mined near Libby had asbestos. By the 1930s the railroad would have known asbestos exposure could be hazardous, based on research disseminated at the time through the Association of American Railroads, said plaintiffs’ expert Julie Hart, who chairs the Department of Safety, Health and Industrial Hygiene at Montana Technological University. Late Sunday night, the railroad requested a last-minute delay in the trial and a change of venue to a different state, citing a weekend story by The Associated Press about the trial and asbestos contamination in Libby. Attorneys for the railroad said prospective jurors would be prejudiced by the article, which quoted a 61-year-old Libby resident who has an asbestos-related disease as saying he used to play in and around the rail yard. Morris instead allowed the trial to proceed after telling attorneys not to talk to the news media while it’s ongoing. Another case against BNSF Railway alleging community — rather than work-related — exposure to asbestos is scheduled to go to trial next month in U.S. District Court in Missoula. It was brought by the estate of Mary Diana Moe, 79, who died of mesothelioma in December 2022. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

The deal may come in the near future, subject to market conditions. Berkshire Hathaway would be the first major non-financial overseas debt issuer to kick off a yen deal after the Bank of Japan last month scrapped the world’s last negative interest rate. Spreads on yen-denominated bonds from both Japanese and overseas issuers have tightened to the lowest since September 2022 amid signs BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda won’t rush to hike interest rates again. The extra yield investors seek for corporate debt is about 52 basis points, down from 67 a year ago. “Berkshire’s plan to sell a yen bond is spurring speculation that the company may buy more trading-house shares,” said Atsuko Ishitoya, a strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. Shares of Mitsubishi Corp. gained as much as 2.8%, Sumitomo Corp. jumped 2.3% and Marubeni Corp. rose 1.9%, while the Topix added 0.9%. The purchases by the legendary US investor helped to propel gains in the Japanese stock market last year, with analysts trying to scope out what his next targets might be. “There is hope that undervalued stocks, firms with brand strength as well as financial-related companies may be bought, too. It’s positive for overall Japanese stocks,” Ishitoya said. The US company last turned to the yen bond markets in November, with a ¥122 billion ($803 million) five-tranche deal. It’s a regular issuer of yen bonds, and often taps the market in April. “The timing for foreigners to invest in Japanese companies couldn’t be better,” said Shunsuke Oshida, head of credit research at Manulife Investment Management Japan. “With the governance reforms and the Tokyo bourse’s message to the capital markets, it makes sense that more and more companies are becoming investor-friendly and so foreigners would want to raise funds to invest in them.” Buffett said in his annual letter to investors in late February that Japanese trading companies are following investor-friendly policies, driving speculation that he may increase his stakes in these companies. Berkshire Hathaway has funded most of its current Japanese investment through yen bonds, the letter said. “Berkshire has issued big amounts in the past, surpassing ¥100 billion, which shows that it’s been successful in attracting a wide range of investors,” said Kazuma Ogino, senior credit analyst at Nomura Securities Co. --With assistance from Winnie Hsu and Naoto Hosoda.

He said investors continually admire Buffett, but have turned on Musk with the sharp decline in Tesla's share price. \"We are in a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately business. Buffett does it endlessly,\" he said. \"Musk? Nothing that can make you money right now. And no matter what, to the small mind of Wall Street, that's really all that it's all about.\" To Cramer, investors love Musk as long as Tesla's stock is performing well, saying they call him a \"genius\" and praise the company's electric vehicles. But now that Tesla's down more than 30% year to date, many have changed their tune, with some noting Musk's electric vehicles are falling in price and that he faces stiff competition from Chinese carmakers, Cramer said. They might also be worried that the CEO is distracted by other ventures like his takeover of X, formerly known as Twitter, according to Cramer. \"With the downgrades and price target cuts, the long knives are really out for Musk,\" Cramer said. \"They obviously never liked him, they only liked that Tesla's stock was a juggernaut.\" But Cramer hasn't lost faith in the Tesla CEO. \"Look, even when Tesla's business is faltering and the stock is going down, I always caveat that by reminding you that Elon Musk is brilliant,\" he said. \"But now there are overtones that he's lost his touch or maybe become more of an evil genius — which I think, by the way, is unfair, but life's unfair.\" Cramer said Buffett isn't a \"tough call\" for investors, saying his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway \"has so many levers that it's truly magnificent.\" He said the company has a solid portfolio, adding its insurance business is essential because auto insurance companies often raise rates, and that Buffett's Geico is the best and the cheapest.

    "content": "Get local news delivered to your inbox! Hundreds of people have died and more have been sickened from asbestos exposure in the Libby, Montana area. BNSF Railway faces accusations of wrongful death for failing to control clouds of contaminated dust. The railroad denies the charges. (AP video by Matthew Brown/Production by Thomas Pe… LIBBY, Mont. — Paul Resch remembers playing baseball as a kid on a field constructed from asbestos-tainted vermiculite, mere yards from railroad tracks where trains kicked up clouds of dust as they hauled the contaminated material from a mountaintop mine through the northwestern Montana town of Libby. He liked to sneak into vermiculite-filled storage bins at an adjacent rail yard, to trap pigeons that he would feed, during long days spent by the tracks along the Kootenai River. Paul Resch, seen April 4 near Libby, Mont., has asbestos-related disease and is among thousands of people who were exposed to asbestos after contaminated vermiculite was mined near Libby and shipped through the small town by rail.  Today, Resch, 61, is battling an asbestos-related disease that has severely scarred his left lung. He's easily winded, quickly tires and knows there is no cure for an illness that could suffocate him over time. “At some point, probably everybody got exposed to it,” he said, speaking of asbestos-tainted vermiculite. “There was piles of it along the railroad tracks. ... You would get clouds of dust blowing around downtown.” Respiratory therapist Vernon Johnson, left, conducts a pulmonary test on Christine Ekstedt at the Center for Asbestos Related Disease on April 4 in Libby, Mont.  Almost 25 years after federal authorities responding to news reports of deaths and illnesses descended on Libby, a town of about 3,000 people near the U.S.-Canada border, some asbestos victims and their family members are seeking to hold publicly accountable one of the major corporate players in the tragedy: BNSF Railway. Hundreds of people died and more than 3,000 have been sickened from asbestos exposure in the Libby area, according to researchers and health officials. Texas-based BNSF faces accusations of negligence and wrongful death for failing to control clouds of contaminated dust that used to swirl from the rail yard and settle across Libby’s neighborhoods. The vermiculite was shipped by rail from Libby for use as insulation in homes and businesses across the U.S. The railroad — owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. — has denied responsibility in court filings and declined further comment. Dr. Lee Morissette shows an image of lungs damaged by asbestos exposure, at the Center for Asbestos Related Disease on April 4 in Libby, Mont.  Resch works at an auto dealership in Libby and his wife is listed as a plaintiff in a pending lawsuit against BNSF in Montana's asbestos claims court. He's uncertain whether his sickness came from the rail yard. The Libby high school track included contaminated vermiculite, as did insulation in the walls and attics of homes he entered during his two decades as a volunteer firefighter. The plaintiffs for the upcoming trial against BNSF, the estates of Joyce Walder and Thomas Wells, lived near the Libby rail yard and moved away decades ago. Both died in 2020 of mesothelioma, a rare lung cancer caused by asbestos that is disproportionately common in Libby. The mine a few miles outside town once produced up to 80% of global vermiculite supplies. It closed in 1990. Nine years later, the Environmental Protection Agency arrived in Libby and a subsequent cleanup has cost an estimated $600 million, with most covered by taxpayer money. It's ongoing, but authorities say asbestos volumes in downtown Libby's air are 100,000 times lower than when the mine was operating.   Awareness about the dangers of asbestos grew significantly over the intervening years, and last month the EPA banned the last remaining industrial uses of asbestos in the U.S. The ban did not include the type of asbestos fiber found in Libby or address so-called “legacy” asbestos that's already in homes, schools and businesses. A long-awaited government analysis of the remaining risks is due by Dec. 1. This photo from the 1960s shows a baseball field next to a railyard in Libby, Mont., where asbestos-tainted vermiculite was stored after being mined from a nearby mountain. Asbestos doesn’t burn and resists corrosion, making it long lasting in the environment. People who inhale the needle-shaped fibers can develop health problems as many as 40 years after exposure. Health officials expect to grapple with newly diagnosed cases of asbestos disease for decades. The EPA declared the nation’s first ever public health emergency under the Superfund cleanup program in Libby in 2009. The pollution led to civil claims from thousands of people who worked for the mine or the railroad, or who lived in the Libby area. During a yearslong cleanup of the Libby rail yard that began in 2003, crews excavated nearly the entire yard, removing about 18,000 tons of contaminated soil. In 2020, BNSF signed a consent decree with federal authorities resolving its cleanup work in Libby and nearby Troy, plus a 42-mile stretch (68 kilometers) of railroad right-of-way. Last year, BNSF won a federal lawsuit against an asbestos treatment clinic in Libby that a jury found submitted 337 false asbestos claims, making patients eligible for Medicare and other benefits. The judge overseeing the case ordered the Center for Asbestos Related Disease to pay almost $6 million in penalties and damages, forcing the facility into bankruptcy. It continues to operate with reduced staff. Some asbestos victims viewed the case as a ploy to discredit the clinic and undermine lawsuits against the railroad. BNSF said the verdict would deter \"future misconduct” by the clinic. In the months leading up to this week's trial, attorneys for BNSF repeatedly tried to deflect blame for people getting sick, including by pointing to the actions of W.R. Grace and Co., which owned the mine from 1963 until it closed. They also questioned whether other asbestos sources could have caused the two plaintiffs’ illnesses and suggested Walder and Wells would have been trespassing on railroad property. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris blocked BNSF from blaming the conduct of others as a means of escaping liability. And he said the law doesn’t support the notion that trespassing reduces a property owner’s duty not to cause harm. Morris has yet to issue a definitive ruling on another key issue: the railroad’s claim that its obligation to ship goods for paying customers exempts it from liability. The plaintiffs argue the rail yard in downtown Libby — where Resch once played in piles of vermiculite — was used for storage and not just transportation, meaning the railroad is not exempt. Montana's Supreme Court ruled in a separate case that BNSF and its predecessors were more involved in the mine than simply shipping its product. Mine owner W.R. Grace filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and paid $1.8 billion into an asbestos trust fund to settle future cases.  Photo Credit: Drazen Zigic / Shutterstock A combination of economic factors, evolving since 2020, has fundamentally reshaped numerous industries and redefined individuals' relationships with work. Among the most notable outcomes of these transformations is the surge in entrepreneurial activity, including business sales. Historically low interest rates and high government stimulus provided entrepreneurs and investors with easy access to funding. Transitions to remote and hybrid work and the rise of ecommerce made digitally-based businesses more attractive. Amid the Great Resignation, more workers considered career alternatives including entrepreneurship. While inflation and rising interest rates have somewhat cooled activity in the market more recently, signs point to sustained interest in entrepreneurial activity. Since the beginning of COVID-19, interest in buying and selling businesses has exploded Source: Flippa analysis of Google Trends data (2005–2024) | Image Credit: Flippa According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, total new business application volume today is approximately 50% greater than before the pandemic began in early 2020. And entrepreneurs are also considering transactions around existing businesses. Google search data has shown a spike in the search terms “how to sell a business” and “how to buy a business” in recent years. In the Google Trends index, search interest in both terms has risen from the high 30s (out of 100) before COVID to 80+ now, indicating significantly elevated interest. While California accounts for the most buyer volume, lower-tax states account for a greater proportion of seller volume Source: Flippa marketplace transactions (2016–2024) | Image Credit: Flippa In recent years, the rapid pace of digital transformation has generated unparalleled demand for online businesses. While interest in entrepreneurship is up throughout the country, the volume of transactions varies by geography. Notably, residents in California, the epicenter of Silicon Valley, lead the pack of digital asset buyers, followed closely by those in Florida. Each state accounts for approximately 14% of total buyer volume. Other top states for buyers include Texas (8.9%), New York (7.3%), and Illinois (6.1%). However, the scenario shifts when examining sellers, where California residents do not dominate transaction volumes to the same extent. Instead, residents from states with lower or no tax implications, such as Florida, Texas, and Washington, command a significantly higher share of total seller volume at 15.8%, 14.2%, and 12.8%, respectively. States in the Mountain West & Florida stand out for high levels of business transactions Source: Flippa marketplace transactions (2016–2024) | Image Credit: Flippa On a per capita basis, states in the Mountain West and Florida are home to a higher volume of buyers. Wyoming leads all states in buyer volume per capita at 3.38 times higher than the U.S. average, with other western states like Idaho, Arizona, and Washington also having buyer volume more than twice the national rate. Leading states for sellers include Delaware, where the seller volume per capita is nearly 11 times higher than the U.S. average, and Wyoming, where the volume is almost 10 times higher. Delaware, Wyoming, and other leading states for sellers tend to be popular places to start a business due to business-friendly regulatory and tax structures. For example, Delaware is known for having clear corporate law, good liability and privacy protections, an efficient corporate court system, and certain tax advantages that make it an attractive place to operate. Meanwhile, Wyoming is regularly rated as having one of the best tax climates for businesses due to its lack of corporate and individual income taxes and relatively low sales tax rates. Below is a comparison of per capita business transaction volumes for buyers and sellers in all 50 states. The analysis was conducted by Flippa using over 100,000 business transactions on its marketplace spanning the past eight years. For more information, see the methodology section below. Photo Credit: Drazen Zigic / Shutterstock The data used in this study is from a proprietary set of more than 125,000 digital asset sales that occurred on the Flippa.com marketplace between 2016 and 2024. To determine the states with the most active tech investors, researchers at Flippa calculated how each state’s total transaction sales volume per capita compared to the U.S. average for both buyers and sellers. The total transaction sales volume was calculated as the sum of the sale prices for all transactions. States were ordered by the per capita buyer transaction volume.

Cornell University researcher Niko Kochendoerfer pets a sheep grazing at a solar farm in Ithaca, upstate New York during a 2021 study. Photo / Heather Ainsworth, AP \nWall Street investors are deploying flocks of sheep to trim the grass covering their solar panel installations as they seek to burnish their green credentials and win local support for sometimes divisive new renewable energy\nprojects.\n Inflation Reduction Act tax incentives and cash injections from the likes of subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway and quantitative hedge fund DE Shaw last year helped the US solar energy industry grow at its fastest ever pace, with enough capacity brought online to power roughly 6 million American homes. Ranchers from New York state to California have been some of the projects’ first beneficiaries. The number of solar power sites using sheep to graze the grass and pervasive Russian thistle that grow around panels has risen tenfold over the past two years, according to not-for-profit trade body the American Solar Grazing Association. The group estimates that 80,000 sheep now graze roughly 100,000 acres across 500 solar power sites in 27 states — reaching nooks and crannies below solar panels that bulky lawnmowers struggle to trim.  ASGA’s website says sheep “are resourceful foragers, walking to search for vegetation that might otherwise become a shady nuisance for the solar company”. It added that “for the safety of the existing, low-mount solar arrays, goats, cows, pigs and horses are not recommended”. Jonathan Kett, executive director of special projects at DE Shaw Renewable Investments (Desri), said: “We typically sign contracts for what we call vegetation management, which is just a fancy way of saying ‘cutting the grass and weeds’, and in a lot of our portfolios we consider whether sheep are a practical option... in some instances it’s a really natural fit.” “We’re not the ones out there shepherding the sheep around and getting in water and stuff,” he added. Desri says it now manages about 3,000 acres of grazing land and generates enough solar energy to power the city of Denver. Farmers are typically paid $1 per acre each time they visit a site, usually two or three times a year, with about 200 sheep required per hundred acres. Among the converts is Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary BHE Renewables, whose Topaz and Solar Star facilities in California produce about 1.1 megawatts of power every year. An army of 5,000 sheep tends to Topaz alone. BHE said: “We assess effectiveness of our vegetation management strategy from the previous year and examine rainfall amounts during the winter months to determine how many sheep will be needed on site to make sure we have an effective grazing strategy.” The backing from some of the country’s biggest finance groups has come at an opportune time for the US sheep industry, which for decades has grappled with declining production and shrinking revenues as demand for wool and lamb meat has slumped.  Sheep and lamb production makes up less than 1 per cent of the American livestock industry, according to US meat industry lobbying group the Animal Agriculture Alliance. “Another reason [for the industry’s decline] is historical,” said Susan Schoenian, sheep and goat specialist emeritus at the University of Maryland Extension. “During the Second World War, US soldiers were fed mutton — could’ve been goat, could’ve been sheep — and they came back saying ‘I ain’t never eating that crap again’”. Sheep farmers have had to diversify their sources of income to survive. So-called solar grazing represents “the biggest opportunity [the sheep] industry has seen in at least a generation or more”, said Ryan Indart, a fourth-generation rancher from California. MN8 Energy, which was spun out of Goldman Sachs in 2018, owns a 390-megawatt site in Kings County and a 2,100-acre plot in Lemoore, California — both of which have been maintained by Indart’s Solar Sheep Grazing. MN8 did not respond to a request for comment. Solar power companies and farmers team up in “quite a grassroots kind of way”, said ASGA president Nick Armentrout. “Often it’s as simple as there’s a solar site under construction or constructed and a neighbouring farmer just stops in there and asks questions.” New York-based infrastructure investment group Greenbacker Capital operates a dozen solar-grazing sites across the US. “Having a local farmer servicing a site can help keep theft down, plus you have someone who’s better equipped to steward the land than a traditional mower,” said Shannon Scarbrough, Greenbacker’s sustainability programme manager. “And in a rural community [solar grazing] adds a bit of charm.” Desri’s executive director of development Liz Peyton said that in cases where land had been used for agriculture prior to the construction of a solar site, “it can be a hard transition for local communities”. “If they know that the land isn’t going to be used for a dairy farm, but that sheep will still be grazing, that helps to ease some of the hesitance around the change,” Peyton added. Some farmers have found it tricky to secure bank loans against their slowly growing solar-grazing businesses, preventing the wider industry from growing even faster than it already is.  “If you’re a small operator... and you go to the bank with a two- or three-year payout on equipment and livestock and you’ve got a one-year contract, that’s a tough sell to a banker,” said JR Howard, owner of Texas Solar Sheep. And some green energy groups found sheep more trouble than they are worth. “The sheep didn’t like to eat the weeds we needed them to eat, plus their hair kept getting caught in the inverters, causing equipment damage,” said a spokesperson for a Florida-based renewable energy group who asked not to be named. “Considering all those factors, they wound up not saving money [compared with] traditional mowing,” the person said. “[The sheep] were super cute, and our customers loved them, but alas.” Written by: George Steer in New York © Financial Times Share this article Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

    "content": "  Home » Investing Stock markets broadly trended lower on Wednesday after a disappointing inflation report. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.5% in March over the previous 12 months. That reading is up from 3.2% in February and higher than the 3.4% that was anticipated by economists. It’s also the highest rate since September 2023.  The markets did not take the news well. There had been hope that the inflation rate would keep trending lower, which in turn would hopefully prompt the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates sooner rather than later.  However, the March inflation result could indicate that the Fed may not start easing as soon as some had anticipated. All eyes will be on the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, a key inflation gauge for the Fed, when it comes out on April 26. Investors have already been through the worst of it as far as inflation goes, but if they are looking for a stock that has largely been resistant to inflation to balance things out, look no further than Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B). Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett and the late Charlie Munger built the firm precisely for times like this: to withstand shocks to the market like inflation rates at a 40-year high, like they were in 2022.  The conglomerate is largely made up of a $350 billion stock portfolio and the almost 70 privately held companies it owns, including brand names like GEICO, Dairy Queen, Benjamin Moore, Duracell, and Business Wire, to name a few. Among the companies Berkshire owns are several insurance companies, including ones it also manages, like Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance and Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies, along with GEICO and others.  Berkshire Hathaway uses the float from the insurance companies to invest in its massive stock portfolio. In addition, it also owns a railroad, energy and utility companies, industrial firms, manufacturing companies, retailers, construction and building businesses, consumer staples, and service companies.  Jeff Bezos once asked Buffett: “You are the second-richest man in the world and yet you have the simplest investment thesis. How come others didn’t follow this?”Warren Buffett responded: “Because no one wants to get rich slowly.” pic.twitter.com/6lKYdFCh3t Buffett and his team have carefully selected those companies and the ones in Berkshire’s stock portfolio, adhering to Buffett’s philosophy of investing in businesses that are well-managed, are good values, have consistent earnings, and are generally sturdy, stable businesses across a variety of industries that have long track records of success. That formula has worked beautifully for Berkshire Hathaway over the years and has allowed the company to effectively manage the markets’ ups and downs over the past 50+ years. Consider the results. When the market is down, Berkshire Hathaway is usually up. That was the case in 2022, when the stock was up 3% in a year when the S&P 500 was down 19%, mainly due to high inflation and rising interest rates. In 2018, when the market was off 6%, Berkshire Hathaway was up 3%. Over the past 10 years, Berkshire Hathaway has posted an average annualized return of 12.7%, compared to 10.6% for the S&P 500. Going back 20 years, it has generated a 9.8% annualized return, compared to 7.8% for the S&P 500. One of the reasons Berkshire Hathaway did so well in the most recent bear market was because of the abundance of companies it owns in industries that aren’t prone to wild swings based on economic conditions. For example, companies in consumer staples, energy, and insurance are needed no matter the environment, so they were not as impacted by inflation.  In fact, Berkshire Hathaway’s insurance holdings outperformed in the bear market, as insurance companies actually do fairly well in periods of high inflation because premiums go up, but people still need insurance.  The proof is in the fact that Berkshire Hathaway reported record operating earnings of $30.9 billion in 2022, surpassing that record again in 2023 when it generated $37.4 billion in operating earnings. However, the gains in its portfolio of privately owned companies in 2022 offset the unrealized losses in its stock portfolio that year.  Like the companies it invests in, Berkshire Hathaway is built for the long haul. It probably won’t soar like a technology company in a bull market, but it will produce consistent, reliable returns that investors can count on — in good times and bad.  This year, the stock has popped about 13% year to date, and it’s undervalued with a price-to-earnings ratio of 9. Berkshire Hathaway is pretty much always a buy, but right now it looks particularly good.  Disclaimer: All investments involve risk.

A gestora brasileira abriu mão da gigante de alimentos que havia nascido após a fusão costurada pelo trio em parceria com o bilionário Warren Buffett. Segundo a reportagem publicada pela CNBC, a influência da firma de private equity na Kraft Heinz vinha diminuindo ano a ano, com redução do número de assentos no conselho de administração de três, no melhor momento, para nenhum, em julho de 2022.

Records show James and Lana McNamara sold the house at 1095 Mariner Drive to a Florida entity named for the address and managed by Alvaro Castro Mendivil and Maria Alejandra Pinzas Arrospide in Coral Gables. Claudine Coto of One Sotheby’s International Realty had the listing, and Giulietta Ulloa of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty brought the buyer. James McNamara was president and CEO of the Spanish language broadcast network from 1999 to 2005, according to LinkedIn. Since leaving Telemundo, he has founded and chaired Panamax Films and Pantelion Films, Latino-focused production and distribution firms. He is also vice chairman of Hemisphere Media Group, a Coral Gables-based Spanish-language media company. He and his wife bought the Mariner Drive home in 2004 for $5.6 million, records show. Built in 1997 on 0.6 acres, the house spans 6,300 square feet, with seven bedrooms, six bathrooms, one half-bathroom, a pool and a dock with capacity for a 100-foot boat, according to records and the listing. The property, a corner lot, has 300 feet of waterfront.  The couple listed it for $22.5 million in November, Redfin shows. It sold for $4.5 million below the asking price.  Other recent deals in Key Biscayne include a waterfront teardown that sold for $16.5 million last month. The seller was Dr. Maurice Ferré Jr., son of the late former mayor of Miami, Maurice A. Ferré.  In February an entity linked to Paul DeStefanis, the head of Miami-based accounting firm Advanced Business Valuations, sold a waterfront home for $24.5 million.

    "description": "The legendary billionaire investor claimed he \"conquered envy.\"",
    "published_at": "2024-04-11T11:12:00Z",
    "content": "For premium support please call: If you’ve ever looked at your neighbor’s shiny new car and uttered curses at their good fortune, you’re not alone. In fact, this feeling of resentment about other people’s financial standing is what makes the world go around, according to the late Charlie Munger. Commercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger Cost-of-living in America is still out of control — use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says Car insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year — but you can be smarter than that. Here's how you can save yourself as much as $820 annually in minutes (it's 100% free) “The world is not driven by greed. It’s driven by envy,” said Warren Buffett’s former right-hand man at the Daily Journal ($DJCO) Annual Meeting in 2022. Munger, who served as Berkshire Hathaway's vice chairman until he passed away last year at the age of 99, said people too often take what they have “for granted” and they fixate on how seemingly unfair it is that other people have “more” than they do — whether that is more money, more tangible assets or even more friends. “I have conquered envy in my own life,” he said, while sitting on a multi-billion dollar pile of assets. “I don’t envy anybody. I don’t give a damn what somebody else has. But other people are driven crazy by it.” To illustrate his point, Munger highlighted the “pretentious expenditures of the rich.” “Who in the hell needs a real Rolex watch, so you can get mugged for it?” he said — noting that America’s “modern capitalist society” makes people think they need these uber-expensive items to feel like they’ve somehow made it. “My advice to young people is: don’t go there,” Munger added. “The hell with the pretentious expenditure. I don’t think there’s much happiness in it.” Interestingly, Jean-Frédéric Dufour, the CEO of the Swiss watch company, recently said people viewing luxury watches as investments “sends the wrong message and is dangerous.” Here’s how Munger preferred to invest his money. Rather than dropping thousands of dollars on “pretentious expenditures,” Munger preferred to put his money to work by investing — and his efforts resulted in an enviable investment portfolio. He was a well-known proponent of value investing, which is a strategy that involves buying stocks that are trading below their intrinsic or fair value. Read more: These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how Throughout his long life, Munger advocated for investing in high-quality businesses with strong brands, a competitive advantage, good cash flow, low debt and the ability to raise prices over time. He worked on the assumption that good opportunities were few and far between, and he was willing to pay more for quality. Munger referred to companies' competitive advantages as “economic moats.” A term popularized by Buffett, it refers to the unique attributes or “barriers” of a business that protect its market share and profitability as it competes with rivals, such that it will likely generate high returns on capital over the long term. As Munger put it: “We buy barriers, we don’t build them. Some industries simply don’t have barriers to entry and never will, so we avoid them.” He said his aim was to “always look for durable competitive advantage” — which he found in companies like See’s Candies, Coca-Cola and later Apple, all of which have made big bucks for the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate. Once Munger identified the high-quality businesses he wanted to back, he played the long game and used a buy-and-hold investment strategy to reap the benefits of compound interest and generate attractive returns as the market corrected its pricing inefficiencies. “All intelligent investing is value investing, acquiring more than you are paying for,” he once said. “You must value the business in order to value the stock.” As for playing the long game, Munger once said: “The big money is not in the buying or selling, but in the waiting.” Ultimately, his strategies were very successful. When Munger passed away on Nov. 28, 2023, the nonagenarian had a net worth of around $2.6 billion, according to Forbes — a different level of legacy to a Rolex watch and a nice house. Building an investment portfolio worth billions of dollars will guarantee your financial security and give you the ability to buy what you want, when you want and guilt-free. But it doesn’t necessarily guarantee happiness. So, what was Munger’s secret to a long and happy life? In an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box” in 2019, he said: “It’s so simple. You don’t have a lot of envy. You don’t have a lot of resentment. You don’t overspend your income. You stay cheerful in spite of your troubles. You deal with reliable people, and you do what you’re supposed to do.” He added, “All these simple rules work so well to make your life better. And they’re so trite.” Jeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe — you may want to do the same in 2024 Owning real estate for 'passive income' is one of the biggest myths in investing — but here's how you can actually make it work You don't need to invest like Warren Buffett to get rich — this simple technique tops his returns without taking on more risk This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

    "content": "Canva If you want to build the listing side of your business in the wake of the NAR settlement, Jimmy Burgess has 30 practical, actionable, doable strategies tailor-made for this moment. Inman Connect At Inman Connect Las Vegas, July 30-Aug. 1 2024, the noise and misinformation will be banished, all your big questions will be answered, and the new business opportunities that await will be revealed. Join us. “List to last” is a saying that has long been quoted in real estate. In the wake of a post-NAR settlement environment, its significance rings truer than ever. If you’re looking to increase the number of listings you take, this article shares 30 unique strategies or areas that can make it happen. Let’s start with one of the foundational strategies for generating listings, geographical farming. Farming, when executed properly, is the best listing strategy I know for providing a consistent flow of quality listing prospects. If you don’t have an area that you are farming, now is the time to start. If you have an existing farm area, now is the time to expand and add additional farms. If you’d like a more detailed breakdown on how to choose and market to a geographical farm in a way that gets results, this article will help. Airbnb owners are rarely satisfied with their current investments. Either they aren’t getting the returns they want and want to sell, or they are excited about their investments and want to look for another one. Many of the current Airbnb owners bought during the pandemic when booking rates were high and it was a trendy investment to make. Then came the reality of managing the property, maintenance costs, and oftentimes disappointing revenue results. This makes calling these owners a prime opportunity for agents looking to find listings and potential buyers.  Here’s a simple script when calling Airbnb owners: This is [agent name] with [company]. I saw where you own the Airbnb at [address], and I was wondering if there is a price where you might consider selling the home. If they show any indication of possibly selling, you’ve found a potential listing. If they say they love it, ask if they would consider buying another place if you found one that made sense for them. These conversations are a great way to uncover both listing and selling opportunities. YouTube has become the No. 2 search engine right behind Google. By producing local video content on neighborhoods, your city, and seller-specific search titles, listing leads can be generated organically.  Here are a few title ideas for videos you can shoot that will attract listing leads: If you’re looking for five additional searchable YouTube content ideas, check out this article. Calling the owners around a home that recently sold is a great way to add value and uncover listing opportunities.  This is a simple script starter for these calls: This is [agent name] with [company]. I’m calling to make sure you have the details of the sale of the home a few doors down from yours at [address] since this sale will affect the value of your home. Have you received the details about that sale? Find ways to add value to homeowners, and you will generate more listing opportunities. Neighborhood Facebook groups are a great way to connect the owners with each other and for you to “host the party.” If you can identify an area or neighborhood that doesn’t currently have a Facebook group, this can be a goldmine for listing leads. One of the best ways to turn one successful listing sale into additional opportunities is to host a going away party for your sellers. Offer to host the event, send out the invitations, and provide the food and drinks.  By sending the invitations, you will capture the contact info for all the attendees, and you will have the ability to be introduced to your seller’s friends at the event. You can add sponsors to reduce some of the expenses, but this is a memorable way to honor your sellers and expand your sphere of influence. Heidi Harris out of Raleigh, North Carolina, first brought this strategy to my attention. She decided to stop buying leads and instead spend that money buying lunch for her sphere of influence. If you focus on deepening the relationships you already have, they will expand your business through repeat business and referrals. As the markets continue to normalize, expired listings will become increasingly more common. Now is the time to develop an expired listing program that systematically adds value to these homeowners who have raised their hand to let everyone know they desire to sell their home, but their previous listing agent was unable to make it happen for them. Posting buyer needs on social media can uncover opportunities for listings.  This is an example of a post to use if you have buyers looking for a specific type of home in a specific area: Little help please! I have a potential buyer who is looking for a home on the east side of town in the [whatever school district] with a minimum of 4 bedrooms and a fenced-in backyard. We have seen all the homes currently on the market, and this buyer might be willing to pay a premium for the right home. Please DM me or reach out if you know of someone considering selling a home that meets these criteria to see if we might be able to have a win-win situation for this buyer and someone preparing to sell their home. Activity breeds activity. The next time you host an open house make sure you provide a time before the public open house for neighbors to check the home out prior to the anticipated crowds of people.  This is a script you can utilize via phone, mail or door-knocking prior to the open house to invite the neighbors: I’m [agent name] with [company]. We will be hosting an open house this Saturday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at your neighbor’s house that we currently have listed for sale. We will have the home open exclusively for owners in the neighborhood to preview before the public between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. in case you want to see it before the anticipated crowds. I hope to see you on Saturday. Anyone that shows up between 10-11 a.m. is a prospective listing due to their desire to see the home and, in many cases, to compare it to theirs. These attendees are prime listing prospects. The marketing you do for your current listings can be more valuable than just helping get that home sold. It should be utilized as an example of how you differentiate yourself from other agents. The neighbors who are considering selling are paying attention to the marketing you do. The better your marketing with your current listings today, the more homes you will have the opportunity to list and market in the future. If you’re looking for a step-by-step guide on how to turn your next listing into additional listings, this article has 23 ways to make it happen. For sale by owners (FSBOs) often end up listing their homes with agents due to either frustration with the process or an inability to attract a buyer. Developing a plan of action where you provide value to the owners while they attempt to sell the home themselves positions you to be the agent of choice when and if they decide to list their home with an agent. Providing unsolicited video CMAs is a unique way to provide homeowners with something of value in a creative manner that makes you stand out. This is done by recording your screen via a tool, such as BombBomb or Zoom, where you walk through the valuation of the owner’s home, sharing the comparable sales and details. I personally did 72 of these during a three-month period that led to over $11 million in listings. If you’d like a more detailed breakdown of this strategy and how you can put it to work in your business, check out this article. When a listing expires, homeowners can expect dozens of calls from agents asking if they are interested in relisting their home for sale. The number of calls often leads to homeowners freezing and deciding to wait before relisting their home. After the first month, many of the agents that called will give up and fade away. By the time the listing has been expired for six months the calls from agents have most likely stopped. This process involves searching the MLS for 6- to 18-month-old, expired listings. Continue your research by making sure they have not been relisted or sold.  Then call with a simple script like this: This is [agent name] with [company]. I saw that your home was for sale nine months ago and am wondering if you still plan to sell it. Give them a chance to answer, and add value from there. “Ask and you shall receive” is not just an often-used Bible quote. It’s true regarding referrals in real estate as well. Many of the agents leaving the business have relationships with homeowners they sold homes to over the past two to five years. Offering to pay them a referral fee for an introduction to their past clients is another way to create win-win opportunities for you and these former agents. Probate is the process of distributing assets from an estate after someone passes away. This includes real estate, and once the court appoints an executor of the estate, they usually can list and sell real estate that is a part of the estate. This is an opportunity to provide value to estates, executors of the estates or probate attorneys in a way that creates listing leads. Most local chambers of commerce have local Business Netorking International (BNI) groups or lead groups. These are a great way to partner with other local business owners to share and gain leads. When you have buyers who desire to be in a specific neighborhood, call owners with a script like this: This is [agent name] with [company]. We are working with buyers who specifically want to buy a home in your neighborhood with a minimum of three bedrooms. They have not been able to find a home that fits their needs and may be willing to pay a premium if they find the right place. I’m calling to do everything I can to find them a home. Do you know of any of your neighbors who are considering selling their home, or have you considered selling your home? This call is an example of going the extra mile for your prospective buyers, and it can uncover listing opportunities as well. Having ChatGPT write SEO-optimized blog posts or LinkedIn articles can lead to listing leads.  This is an example prompt to help you get the process started: Act as an expert real estate copywriter specializing in writing blog posts [or LinkedIn articles] for real estate agents. Provide me with 7 SEO-optimized titles for blog posts targeting homeowners in [your city] who are interested in selling their home. Sift through the titles it provides, and follow up with the following prompt: Please write an SEO-optimized blog post using [title of your choice] as the title. Add a strong call to action to call me for additional details and to receive a free, no-obligation valuation analysis of what their home will sell for. Whether it be letting neighbors know about a new listing, an open house or recently sold home in their neighborhood, door knocking provides agents a purposeful reason to get face-to-face with homeowners. Utilize Instagram stories to share behind-the-scenes details on setting up for an open house, launching a listing with the marketing you prepare, shooting video content or any other real estate-related activity. This will help your prospects connect with you on a more personal level, leading to more business. Maximize your yard signs by utilizing attractive, clean signs, providing QR codes to video details of the home, and a “take one” box with flyers that include personal marketing about yourself on the back of the flyer. The yard sign is a billboard for you and your future listing clients in that neighborhood. Don’t miss out on maximizing the potential your yard signs provide. Sharing the details of your successful sale with neighbors of the home you recently sold increases their confidence that you can sell their home as well. Don’t miss doing the basics. Whether they be video testimonials or social graphic cards quoting your clients, sharing your seller testimonials increases trust, and trust is the precursor to listings. Prospective listing clients will Google you before working with you. Optimize your Google My Business profile to make sure they receive confirmation via your page that you are the listing agent for them. For a detailed description of how to optimize your Google Business Profile, check out this article. Most residential rental agreements are for one year. Utilizing rental websites or your local MLS that shows when homes were rented is an effective way to identify potential future listings. Contact the owners who are six months into their rental agreement to ask if they are planning to rent the home for another year when their current lease expires or if they would consider selling.  If they say they are going to rent it, ask if they would be interested in another investment property if you found them one. From movie nights to family photography days and everything in between, hosting client appreciation parties puts the law of reciprocity in motion, meaning when you do for others, they want to return the favor. For real estate agents, that is often in the form of repeat customers or referrals. Want to say thank you without throwing the effort of an event? This article shares 23 ways to show your clients appreciation. Unfortunately, many divorces lead to the need to sell a home. By connecting with divorce attorneys and providing value to them in the form of home valuations or anything additional they may need assistance with regarding real estate, you can develop a steady stream of listing referrals. Out-of-town homeowners offer a unique way to add value to homeowners who may not have local friends in real estate. They are often less emotional about these homes due to them not being their primary residences. Focusing your efforts on out-of-town owners is an efficient way to build a database of current and future listing prospects. The person who controls the listings controls the market. Act on these strategies, and you will generate more listings. Jimmy Burgess is the CEO for Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Beach Properties of Florida in Northwest Florida.

    "content": "Skip to comments. Posted on 04/12/2024 2:02:10 PM PDT by Roman_War_Criminal We see, therefore, that War is not merely a political act, but also a real political instrument, a continuation of political commerce, a carrying out of the same by other means. Carl von Clausewitz, On War It has been said, and largely understood that the last days final government will have three main components to its structure: the political, economic, and the religious. As such, if we are, indeed, in the last days, we should expect to see all three advancing an equal measures. Thus, shifting gears away from technology for a moment, we will look at the accompanying political movement that is accentuating the increasingly Orwellian technology that seems to be driving, or at least, complimenting, these increasingly disturbing political agendas. Mark Twain once famously said, “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes.” As such, when we note the monumental shift in military strategy away from the traditional means to that of Mosaic Warfare, it begs the question as to why? Why is it necessary? Why does the most powerful nation in history need to worry about things like asymmetric threats, civil war, civilizational collapse, or a new world order? Asymmetrical Warfare: “Unconventional strategies and tactics adopted by a force when the military capabilities of belligerent powers are not simply unequal but are so significantly different that they cannot make the same sorts of attacks on each other.” Encyclopedia Britannica Simply put, our government can no longer keep up with the rising tide of technological advancements that are sweeping the planet. As the 20-year “War on Terror” had borne out, our enemies no longer wore uniforms. They no longer march in armies. They know that on a level playing field, they will get decimated by Western forces, so everything has now become asymmetric because one side has all the obvious advantages, and the other, must fight by other means. Paradoxically, if war is a continuation of politics by other means, then overwhelmingly asymmetric warfare produces the counterreaction of warfare by other means (ie. gray-zone, guerrilla, terrorism, ideological, religious, technological, etc.). Furthermore, as the global dissatisfaction with the 20th-century status quo continues to mount, the world is ready for a change. They no longer want a world order run by a government that changes directions every four years. Our American political system was originally designed to provide a solid bill of rights for the states and the citizenry, as well as provide a balance of power at the top. The government was designed so that the most centrist view possible would largely be the norm, this is due to each administration having to build a coalition with voters who come from every sector of society. That’s all fine and good if both sides decide to play by the rules. But when one side decides that it’s not how many votes one can get, but with those who count the votes, the gig is up, and our entire system hangs by a thread. This author believes that because political corruption has become so systemic, we are at the end of Pax Americana. While by 2024, the rot has fully blossomed, the truth is it began long before that spreading in the shadows and the soft underbelly of our great nation. It’s not just the citizenry who feel it, but the world writ large, be they friend or foe. They too can sense our end is near and are readily prepositioning themselves for the post-American era. Hence the growing chorus who are calling for, and championing initiatives like Agenda 2030 and the Great Reset. The Fourth Reich Since the Nazi's concept of a \"Third Reich, presupposes that there were a First and Second Reich, it behooves us to know what they believed and why before moving forward. Third Reich, official Nazi designation for the regime in Germany from January 1933 to May 1945, as the presumed successor of the medieval and early modern Holy Roman Empire of 800 to 1806 (the First Reich) and the German Empire of 1871 to 1918 (the Second Reich). (Britannica) Not to rehash a thousand-plus years of European history (see image below for that), let's just say that Germany did play a central role in the entirety of the Holy Roman Empire. It began when Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as the Holy Roman Emperor on December 25, 800AD. The Holy Roman Empire itself was the product of the imperial pairing by the Roman Catholic Church which was attempting to consolidate its control over the varying (and often warring) factions in central Europe, as well as revive the Western Roman Empire which had effectively ended around 476AD. Thus, the title claim (i.e., Third Reich) by Hitler and company is at least historically accurate, if not tragically misguided. Stages of Roman Power Time Period The Regal Period 753- 509 BC (244 years) The Republican Rome 509- 49 BC (465 years) Imperial Rome 49BC- 476 AD (525 years) Byzantine Empire 330- 1453 AD (1,123 years) Holy Roman Empire 800-1806 (1,006 years) German Second Reich 1871- 1918 (47 years) German Third Reich 1933- 1945 (12 years) EEC, EU, UfM, NATO 1949- Present (72 years) The Beast Kingdom ??? (7 years) The globalists of today are not much for originality and seem content to recycle old fascist and socialist ideas in the hopes that this time it will work. As such, they are more psychic mediums channeling the dead than they are the political avant-garde. They are simply echoing the ghosts of the past hoping that this time, things will be different. But proving they are attempting to resurrect failed philosophies is far easier than having to watch it unfold in real-time. What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

As such, if we are, indeed, in the last days, we should expect to see all three advancing an equal measures. Thus, shifting gears away from technology for a moment, we will look at the accompanying political movement that is accentuating the increasingly Orwellian technology that seems to be driving, or at least, complimenting, these increasingly disturbing political agendas. Mark Twain once famously said, “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes.” As such, when we note the monumental shift in military strategy away from the traditional means to that of Mosaic Warfare, it begs the question as to why? Why is it necessary? Why does the most powerful nation in history need to worry about things like asymmetric threats, civil war, civilizational collapse, or a new world order? Asymmetrical Warfare: “Unconventional strategies and tactics adopted by a force when the military capabilities of belligerent powers are not simply unequal but are so significantly different that they cannot make the same sorts of attacks on each other.” Encyclopedia Britannica Simply put, our government can no longer keep up with the rising tide of technological advancements that are sweeping the planet. As the 20-year “War on Terror” had borne out, our enemies no longer wore uniforms. They no longer march in armies. They know that on a level playing field, they will get decimated by Western forces, so everything has now become asymmetric because one side has all the obvious advantages, and the other, must fight by other means. Paradoxically, if war is a continuation of politics by other means, then overwhelmingly asymmetric warfare produces the counterreaction of warfare by other means (ie. gray-zone, guerrilla, terrorism, ideological, religious, technological, etc.). Furthermore, as the global dissatisfaction with the 20th-century status quo continues to mount, the world is ready for a change. They no longer want a world order run by a government that changes directions every four years. Our American political system was originally designed to provide a solid bill of rights for the states and the citizenry, as well as provide a balance of power at the top. The government was designed so that the most centrist view possible would largely be the norm, this is due to each administration having to build a coalition with voters who come from every sector of society. That’s all fine and good if both sides decide to play by the rules. But when one side decides that it’s not how many votes one can get, but with those who count the votes, the gig is up, and our entire system hangs by a thread. This author believes that because political corruption has become so systemic, we are at the end of Pax Americana. While by 2024, the rot has fully blossomed, the truth is it began long before that spreading in the shadows and the soft underbelly of our great nation. It’s not just the citizenry who feel it, but the world writ large, be they friend or foe. They too can sense our end is near and are readily prepositioning themselves for the post-American era. Hence the growing chorus who are calling for, and championing initiatives like Agenda 2030 and the Great Reset. The Fourth Reich Since the Nazi's concept of a \"Third Reich, presupposes that there were a First and Second Reich, it behooves us to know what they believed and why before moving forward. Third Reich, official Nazi designation for the regime in Germany from January 1933 to May 1945, as the presumed successor of the medieval and early modern Holy Roman Empire of 800 to 1806 (the First Reich) and the German Empire of 1871 to 1918 (the Second Reich). (Britannica) Not to rehash a thousand-plus years of European history (see image below for that), let's just say that Germany did play a central role in the entirety of the Holy Roman Empire. It began when Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as the Holy Roman Emperor on December 25, 800AD. The Holy Roman Empire itself was the product of the imperial pairing by the Roman Catholic Church which was attempting to consolidate its control over the varying (and often warring) factions in central Europe, as well as revive the Western Roman Empire which had effectively ended around 476AD. Thus, the title claim (i.e., Third Reich) by Hitler and company is at least historically accurate, if not tragically misguided. Stages of Roman Power Time Period The Regal Period 753- 509 BC (244 years) The Republican Rome 509- 49 BC (465 years) Imperial Rome 49BC- 476 AD (525 years) Byzantine Empire 330- 1453 AD (1,123 years) Holy Roman Empire 800-1806 (1,006 years) German Second Reich 1871- 1918 (47 years) German Third Reich 1933- 1945 (12 years) EEC, EU, UfM, NATO 1949- Present (72 years) The Beast Kingdom ??? (7 years) The globalists of today are not much for originality and seem content to recycle old fascist and socialist ideas in the hopes that this time it will work. As such, they are more psychic mediums channeling the dead than they are the political avant-garde. They are simply echoing the ghosts of the past hoping that this time, things will be different. But proving they are attempting to resurrect failed philosophies is far easier than having to watch it unfold in real-time. What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force.

The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground.

As such, if we are, indeed, in the last days, we should expect to see all three advancing an equal measures. Thus, shifting gears away from technology for a moment, we will look at the accompanying political movement that is accentuating the increasingly Orwellian technology that seems to be driving, or at least, complimenting, these increasingly disturbing political agendas. Mark Twain once famously said, “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes.” As such, when we note the monumental shift in military strategy away from the traditional means to that of Mosaic Warfare, it begs the question as to why? Why is it necessary? Why does the most powerful nation in history need to worry about things like asymmetric threats, civil war, civilizational collapse, or a new world order? Asymmetrical Warfare: “Unconventional strategies and tactics adopted by a force when the military capabilities of belligerent powers are not simply unequal but are so significantly different that they cannot make the same sorts of attacks on each other.” Encyclopedia Britannica Simply put, our government can no longer keep up with the rising tide of technological advancements that are sweeping the planet. As the 20-year “War on Terror” had borne out, our enemies no longer wore uniforms. They no longer march in armies. They know that on a level playing field, they will get decimated by Western forces, so everything has now become asymmetric because one side has all the obvious advantages, and the other, must fight by other means. Paradoxically, if war is a continuation of politics by other means, then overwhelmingly asymmetric warfare produces the counterreaction of warfare by other means (ie. gray-zone, guerrilla, terrorism, ideological, religious, technological, etc.). Furthermore, as the global dissatisfaction with the 20th-century status quo continues to mount, the world is ready for a change. They no longer want a world order run by a government that changes directions every four years. Our American political system was originally designed to provide a solid bill of rights for the states and the citizenry, as well as provide a balance of power at the top. The government was designed so that the most centrist view possible would largely be the norm, this is due to each administration having to build a coalition with voters who come from every sector of society. That’s all fine and good if both sides decide to play by the rules. But when one side decides that it’s not how many votes one can get, but with those who count the votes, the gig is up, and our entire system hangs by a thread. This author believes that because political corruption has become so systemic, we are at the end of Pax Americana. While by 2024, the rot has fully blossomed, the truth is it began long before that spreading in the shadows and the soft underbelly of our great nation. It’s not just the citizenry who feel it, but the world writ large, be they friend or foe. They too can sense our end is near and are readily prepositioning themselves for the post-American era. Hence the growing chorus who are calling for, and championing initiatives like Agenda 2030 and the Great Reset. The Fourth Reich Since the Nazi's concept of a \"Third Reich, presupposes that there were a First and Second Reich, it behooves us to know what they believed and why before moving forward. Third Reich, official Nazi designation for the regime in Germany from January 1933 to May 1945, as the presumed successor of the medieval and early modern Holy Roman Empire of 800 to 1806 (the First Reich) and the German Empire of 1871 to 1918 (the Second Reich). (Britannica) Not to rehash a thousand-plus years of European history (see image below for that), let's just say that Germany did play a central role in the entirety of the Holy Roman Empire. It began when Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as the Holy Roman Emperor on December 25, 800AD. The Holy Roman Empire itself was the product of the imperial pairing by the Roman Catholic Church which was attempting to consolidate its control over the varying (and often warring) factions in central Europe, as well as revive the Western Roman Empire which had effectively ended around 476AD. Thus, the title claim (i.e., Third Reich) by Hitler and company is at least historically accurate, if not tragically misguided. Stages of Roman Power Time Period The Regal Period 753- 509 BC (244 years) The Republican Rome 509- 49 BC (465 years) Imperial Rome 49BC- 476 AD (525 years) Byzantine Empire 330- 1453 AD (1,123 years) Holy Roman Empire 800-1806 (1,006 years) German Second Reich 1871- 1918 (47 years) German Third Reich 1933- 1945 (12 years) EEC, EU, UfM, NATO 1949- Present (72 years) The Beast Kingdom ??? (7 years) The globalists of today are not much for originality and seem content to recycle old fascist and socialist ideas in the hopes that this time it will work. As such, they are more psychic mediums channeling the dead than they are the political avant-garde. They are simply echoing the ghosts of the past hoping that this time, things will be different. But proving they are attempting to resurrect failed philosophies is far easier than having to watch it unfold in real-time. What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

As the 20-year “War on Terror” had borne out, our enemies no longer wore uniforms. They no longer march in armies. They know that on a level playing field, they will get decimated by Western forces, so everything has now become asymmetric because one side has all the obvious advantages, and the other, must fight by other means. Paradoxically, if war is a continuation of politics by other means, then overwhelmingly asymmetric warfare produces the counterreaction of warfare by other means (ie. gray-zone, guerrilla, terrorism, ideological, religious, technological, etc.). Furthermore, as the global dissatisfaction with the 20th-century status quo continues to mount, the world is ready for a change. They no longer want a world order run by a government that changes directions every four years. Our American political system was originally designed to provide a solid bill of rights for the states and the citizenry, as well as provide a balance of power at the top. The government was designed so that the most centrist view possible would largely be the norm, this is due to each administration having to build a coalition with voters who come from every sector of society. That’s all fine and good if both sides decide to play by the rules. But when one side decides that it’s not how many votes one can get, but with those who count the votes, the gig is up, and our entire system hangs by a thread. This author believes that because political corruption has become so systemic, we are at the end of Pax Americana. While by 2024, the rot has fully blossomed, the truth is it began long before that spreading in the shadows and the soft underbelly of our great nation. It’s not just the citizenry who feel it, but the world writ large, be they friend or foe. They too can sense our end is near and are readily prepositioning themselves for the post-American era. Hence the growing chorus who are calling for, and championing initiatives like Agenda 2030 and the Great Reset. The Fourth Reich Since the Nazi's concept of a \"Third Reich, presupposes that there were a First and Second Reich, it behooves us to know what they believed and why before moving forward. Third Reich, official Nazi designation for the regime in Germany from January 1933 to May 1945, as the presumed successor of the medieval and early modern Holy Roman Empire of 800 to 1806 (the First Reich) and the German Empire of 1871 to 1918 (the Second Reich). (Britannica) Not to rehash a thousand-plus years of European history (see image below for that), let's just say that Germany did play a central role in the entirety of the Holy Roman Empire. It began when Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as the Holy Roman Emperor on December 25, 800AD. The Holy Roman Empire itself was the product of the imperial pairing by the Roman Catholic Church which was attempting to consolidate its control over the varying (and often warring) factions in central Europe, as well as revive the Western Roman Empire which had effectively ended around 476AD. Thus, the title claim (i.e., Third Reich) by Hitler and company is at least historically accurate, if not tragically misguided. Stages of Roman Power Time Period The Regal Period 753- 509 BC (244 years) The Republican Rome 509- 49 BC (465 years) Imperial Rome 49BC- 476 AD (525 years) Byzantine Empire 330- 1453 AD (1,123 years) Holy Roman Empire 800-1806 (1,006 years) German Second Reich 1871- 1918 (47 years) German Third Reich 1933- 1945 (12 years) EEC, EU, UfM, NATO 1949- Present (72 years) The Beast Kingdom ??? (7 years) The globalists of today are not much for originality and seem content to recycle old fascist and socialist ideas in the hopes that this time it will work. As such, they are more psychic mediums channeling the dead than they are the political avant-garde. They are simply echoing the ghosts of the past hoping that this time, things will be different. But proving they are attempting to resurrect failed philosophies is far easier than having to watch it unfold in real-time. What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into.

The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

They no longer want a world order run by a government that changes directions every four years. Our American political system was originally designed to provide a solid bill of rights for the states and the citizenry, as well as provide a balance of power at the top. The government was designed so that the most centrist view possible would largely be the norm, this is due to each administration having to build a coalition with voters who come from every sector of society. That’s all fine and good if both sides decide to play by the rules. But when one side decides that it’s not how many votes one can get, but with those who count the votes, the gig is up, and our entire system hangs by a thread. This author believes that because political corruption has become so systemic, we are at the end of Pax Americana. While by 2024, the rot has fully blossomed, the truth is it began long before that spreading in the shadows and the soft underbelly of our great nation. It’s not just the citizenry who feel it, but the world writ large, be they friend or foe. They too can sense our end is near and are readily prepositioning themselves for the post-American era. Hence the growing chorus who are calling for, and championing initiatives like Agenda 2030 and the Great Reset. The Fourth Reich Since the Nazi's concept of a \"Third Reich, presupposes that there were a First and Second Reich, it behooves us to know what they believed and why before moving forward. Third Reich, official Nazi designation for the regime in Germany from January 1933 to May 1945, as the presumed successor of the medieval and early modern Holy Roman Empire of 800 to 1806 (the First Reich) and the German Empire of 1871 to 1918 (the Second Reich). (Britannica) Not to rehash a thousand-plus years of European history (see image below for that), let's just say that Germany did play a central role in the entirety of the Holy Roman Empire. It began when Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as the Holy Roman Emperor on December 25, 800AD. The Holy Roman Empire itself was the product of the imperial pairing by the Roman Catholic Church which was attempting to consolidate its control over the varying (and often warring) factions in central Europe, as well as revive the Western Roman Empire which had effectively ended around 476AD. Thus, the title claim (i.e., Third Reich) by Hitler and company is at least historically accurate, if not tragically misguided. Stages of Roman Power Time Period The Regal Period 753- 509 BC (244 years) The Republican Rome 509- 49 BC (465 years) Imperial Rome 49BC- 476 AD (525 years) Byzantine Empire 330- 1453 AD (1,123 years) Holy Roman Empire 800-1806 (1,006 years) German Second Reich 1871- 1918 (47 years) German Third Reich 1933- 1945 (12 years) EEC, EU, UfM, NATO 1949- Present (72 years) The Beast Kingdom ??? (7 years) The globalists of today are not much for originality and seem content to recycle old fascist and socialist ideas in the hopes that this time it will work. As such, they are more psychic mediums channeling the dead than they are the political avant-garde. They are simply echoing the ghosts of the past hoping that this time, things will be different. But proving they are attempting to resurrect failed philosophies is far easier than having to watch it unfold in real-time. What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground.

This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change.

Stages of Roman Power Time Period The Regal Period 753- 509 BC (244 years) The Republican Rome 509- 49 BC (465 years) Imperial Rome 49BC- 476 AD (525 years) Byzantine Empire 330- 1453 AD (1,123 years) Holy Roman Empire 800-1806 (1,006 years) German Second Reich 1871- 1918 (47 years) German Third Reich 1933- 1945 (12 years) EEC, EU, UfM, NATO 1949- Present (72 years) The Beast Kingdom ??? (7 years) The globalists of today are not much for originality and seem content to recycle old fascist and socialist ideas in the hopes that this time it will work. As such, they are more psychic mediums channeling the dead than they are the political avant-garde. They are simply echoing the ghosts of the past hoping that this time, things will be different. But proving they are attempting to resurrect failed philosophies is far easier than having to watch it unfold in real-time. What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

Third Reich, official Nazi designation for the regime in Germany from January 1933 to May 1945, as the presumed successor of the medieval and early modern Holy Roman Empire of 800 to 1806 (the First Reich) and the German Empire of 1871 to 1918 (the Second Reich). (Britannica) Not to rehash a thousand-plus years of European history (see image below for that), let's just say that Germany did play a central role in the entirety of the Holy Roman Empire. It began when Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as the Holy Roman Emperor on December 25, 800AD. The Holy Roman Empire itself was the product of the imperial pairing by the Roman Catholic Church which was attempting to consolidate its control over the varying (and often warring) factions in central Europe, as well as revive the Western Roman Empire which had effectively ended around 476AD.

Third Reich, official Nazi designation for the regime in Germany from January 1933 to May 1945, as the presumed successor of the medieval and early modern Holy Roman Empire of 800 to 1806 (the First Reich) and the German Empire of 1871 to 1918 (the Second Reich). (Britannica) Not to rehash a thousand-plus years of European history (see image below for that), let's just say that Germany did play a central role in the entirety of the Holy Roman Empire. It began when Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as the Holy Roman Emperor on December 25, 800AD. The Holy Roman Empire itself was the product of the imperial pairing by the Roman Catholic Church which was attempting to consolidate its control over the varying (and often warring) factions in central Europe, as well as revive the Western Roman Empire which had effectively ended around 476AD. Thus, the title claim (i.e., Third Reich) by Hitler and company is at least historically accurate, if not tragically misguided. Stages of Roman Power Time Period The Regal Period 753- 509 BC (244 years) The Republican Rome 509- 49 BC (465 years) Imperial Rome 49BC- 476 AD (525 years) Byzantine Empire 330- 1453 AD (1,123 years) Holy Roman Empire 800-1806 (1,006 years) German Second Reich 1871- 1918 (47 years) German Third Reich 1933- 1945 (12 years) EEC, EU, UfM, NATO 1949- Present (72 years) The Beast Kingdom ??? (7 years) The globalists of today are not much for originality and seem content to recycle old fascist and socialist ideas in the hopes that this time it will work. As such, they are more psychic mediums channeling the dead than they are the political avant-garde. They are simply echoing the ghosts of the past hoping that this time, things will be different. But proving they are attempting to resurrect failed philosophies is far easier than having to watch it unfold in real-time. What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

It began when Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as the Holy Roman Emperor on December 25, 800AD. The Holy Roman Empire itself was the product of the imperial pairing by the Roman Catholic Church which was attempting to consolidate its control over the varying (and often warring) factions in central Europe, as well as revive the Western Roman Empire which had effectively ended around 476AD. Thus, the title claim (i.e., Third Reich) by Hitler and company is at least historically accurate, if not tragically misguided. Stages of Roman Power Time Period The Regal Period 753- 509 BC (244 years) The Republican Rome 509- 49 BC (465 years) Imperial Rome 49BC- 476 AD (525 years) Byzantine Empire 330- 1453 AD (1,123 years) Holy Roman Empire 800-1806 (1,006 years) German Second Reich 1871- 1918 (47 years) German Third Reich 1933- 1945 (12 years) EEC, EU, UfM, NATO 1949- Present (72 years) The Beast Kingdom ??? (7 years) The globalists of today are not much for originality and seem content to recycle old fascist and socialist ideas in the hopes that this time it will work. As such, they are more psychic mediums channeling the dead than they are the political avant-garde. They are simply echoing the ghosts of the past hoping that this time, things will be different. But proving they are attempting to resurrect failed philosophies is far easier than having to watch it unfold in real-time. What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months.

(7 years) The globalists of today are not much for originality and seem content to recycle old fascist and socialist ideas in the hopes that this time it will work. As such, they are more psychic mediums channeling the dead than they are the political avant-garde. They are simply echoing the ghosts of the past hoping that this time, things will be different. But proving they are attempting to resurrect failed philosophies is far easier than having to watch it unfold in real-time. What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

As such, they are more psychic mediums channeling the dead than they are the political avant-garde. They are simply echoing the ghosts of the past hoping that this time, things will be different. But proving they are attempting to resurrect failed philosophies is far easier than having to watch it unfold in real-time. What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

(7 years) The globalists of today are not much for originality and seem content to recycle old fascist and socialist ideas in the hopes that this time it will work. As such, they are more psychic mediums channeling the dead than they are the political avant-garde. They are simply echoing the ghosts of the past hoping that this time, things will be different. But proving they are attempting to resurrect failed philosophies is far easier than having to watch it unfold in real-time. What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

(7 years) The globalists of today are not much for originality and seem content to recycle old fascist and socialist ideas in the hopes that this time it will work. As such, they are more psychic mediums channeling the dead than they are the political avant-garde. They are simply echoing the ghosts of the past hoping that this time, things will be different. But proving they are attempting to resurrect failed philosophies is far easier than having to watch it unfold in real-time. What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

(7 years) The globalists of today are not much for originality and seem content to recycle old fascist and socialist ideas in the hopes that this time it will work. As such, they are more psychic mediums channeling the dead than they are the political avant-garde. They are simply echoing the ghosts of the past hoping that this time, things will be different. But proving they are attempting to resurrect failed philosophies is far easier than having to watch it unfold in real-time. What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

(7 years) The globalists of today are not much for originality and seem content to recycle old fascist and socialist ideas in the hopes that this time it will work. As such, they are more psychic mediums channeling the dead than they are the political avant-garde. They are simply echoing the ghosts of the past hoping that this time, things will be different. But proving they are attempting to resurrect failed philosophies is far easier than having to watch it unfold in real-time. What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint.

This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

(7 years) The globalists of today are not much for originality and seem content to recycle old fascist and socialist ideas in the hopes that this time it will work. As such, they are more psychic mediums channeling the dead than they are the political avant-garde. They are simply echoing the ghosts of the past hoping that this time, things will be different. But proving they are attempting to resurrect failed philosophies is far easier than having to watch it unfold in real-time. What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy.

Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

(7 years) The globalists of today are not much for originality and seem content to recycle old fascist and socialist ideas in the hopes that this time it will work. As such, they are more psychic mediums channeling the dead than they are the political avant-garde. They are simply echoing the ghosts of the past hoping that this time, things will be different. But proving they are attempting to resurrect failed philosophies is far easier than having to watch it unfold in real-time. What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare.

Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods.

As such, they are more psychic mediums channeling the dead than they are the political avant-garde. They are simply echoing the ghosts of the past hoping that this time, things will be different. But proving they are attempting to resurrect failed philosophies is far easier than having to watch it unfold in real-time. What they (WEF, UN, Bilderberg, etc.) are championing, are part and parcel the same things the Third Reich championed. As my friend John points out, the similarities between the most wicked government of the 20th century and the neo-progressives of today are simply stunning. The Nazis conducted evil experiments on children and Jews which were performed in German Concentration Camps. The transgender mutilation of children is a perverted part of the globalist agenda. The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it).

The Nazis rejected true Christian faith and embraced false occult religious beliefs and earth worship. The globalists reject the Christian faith and embrace the new age, pagan, eastern religious movements, and earth worship. The Nazis Desire to have an elite, pure, genetically bred Aryan race to rule the world. The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

The globalists want an elite race of higher-evolved humans (transhuman) to rule the world by genetic modification and/or technological evolution. The Nazis believe in Social Darwinism and that some humans are lesser (nothing more than evolved animals) and others are a higher level of human, and that survival of the fittest would elevate the Aryans to the top while the lower life firms would die out or fall into perpetual serfdom. The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media).

State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

The globalists believe in evolution and that the planet is changing, making survival of the fittest means the fittest are the elites who can merge with technology and jump-start the next leap of evolution. The useless eaters of old humanity will die out or be killed. Occultic symbols and celebrations were an integral part of the Nazi regime (i.e., black sun, swastika, phoenix, lightning bolts, etc.) Occultic symbols and celebrations are integral for the global elite and will culminate with the ultimate occult symbol, the mark of the beast. The Nazis desired to rid the world of the useless (i.e., Jews, gypsies, invalids, communists, etc., in Germany) and repurpose the conquered territories to create more living room (lebensraum) and protect the planet's resources. Globalists believe most of the planet is useless eaters (the mass population) and the world needs to be reduced to under a billion people to create more space for the elite and save the earth’s resources. It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding.

However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

It appears that Mao’s \"Great Leap Forward\" famine from 1959-61 (which killed upwards of 50 million Chinese) might serve as a blueprint. The Nazis worship the earth (Himmler -Blood and Soil) Globalists worship the earth (Gaia). The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media.

The Nazis made sure the Jews couldn’t own anything and confiscated their wealth. The globalists want you to own nothing and be happy, which ultimately must be a plan to confiscate all the world’s wealth either by fraud or force. The Nazis sent the rejected to ghettos to isolate them in a central area. The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone.

They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media.

They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them.

The globalists want to centralize the populations in 15-minute cities. The Nazis built and transformed large buildings into death chambers. What are all the big buildings for data storage being built? The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding.

Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them.

The Nazis were fanatical about numbering everyone. The global government is fanatical about everyone having a global ID. The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast.

The Nazis were sexual perverts. The globalists push the equality of LGBTQ perversion. The Nazis knew the funding of the Reich could come from stealing the wealth of the deported and murdered Jews. The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from.

The globalists believe they can destroy the world’s financial system and then steal all the wealth of the world before they kill and conquer. They are very confident that all this will soon be theirs. The Third Reich had total propaganda control over news and media. Beginning with Operation Mockingbird, the globalists are using national intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies to censor, ban, deplatform, debank, and imprison those who dare question the narrative put forth by the \"fifth column\" (i.e., legacy media). They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords.

Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation.

They are also feverishly working to control social media along the same lines. Both practiced deceiving on a large scale to brainwash the masses. The Nazis held no regard for the national borders of other nations and wanted to expand into those territories. The globalists are pushing for the destruction of borders so they can destroy those nations and all the world will be their playground. Meet the New Gatekeepers; Same as the Old Gatekeepers At the end of World War 1, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were in ruin. After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries.

Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

After 47 years, the Second Reich, as it were, was officially dead and the psyche of the German people shattered. However, it was in their collective, national post-war desperation that a group like the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), which translates to the National Socialist German Workers' National Socialists (aka- the German Nazi Party) could rise from the downtrodden streets of Munich to controlling all of Germany from Berlin in just a few short years. As I’m fond of saying, desperate times make people desperate. By intentionally undermining the current economic foundation of Western civilization, the globalists appear to be intent on putting us back on a familiar trajectory toward a post-World War 1 level of desperation. This deliberate destruction entails forsaking the very things that made Western Civilization flourish. Things like the Judeo-Christian ethic, free-market capitalism, the rule of law, objective truth, nationalism, and a belief in a higher power beyond ourselves. For the modern-day Nimrods’, the goal is to actualize a \"Great Reset\" by 2030 forcing the world to reshape its present global order (currently dominated by the United States), into a technocratic oligarchy. Throughout this transformative process, a series of unrelated, yet interconnected crises will exacerbate global desperation until the people demand a better way. This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation.

State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation.

This will be deliberately induced through financial insolvency, weaponized immigration, food and energy shortages, increased lawlessness, war, terrorism, increased natural disasters, and a general increase in suffering. These circumstances are such that they will provide the fertile breeding grounds for the emergence of the world's final gentile government—the kingdom of the beast. Globalists such as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, George Soros, British royalty, the United Nations (and its various appendages), Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway, etc., are of one mind regarding this coming global change. They truly believe that the only way to save the planet is to be the ones controlling it. They are feverishly planning this regime change under several different auspices, namely through seemingly benevolent legislative initiatives set forth by the United Nation's Agenda 21/ Agenda 2030 programs. These initiatives are then repackaged by other globalist groups such as the Web Economic Forum (WEF), Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., into more palatable and benign terms such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Building Back Better, and the Great Reset and propagandized by the fifth column mainstream media. But if we were going to be completely honest, the 2020s are beginning to rhyme a whole lot with the 1920-30s. Take, for example, the Third Reich's historical economic model (ala fascism) was built in four-year blocks, the first of which began by borrowing massive amounts of money it never intended to pay back. The second four-year block was geared totally toward a war economy. The bold black is the historical model the Third Reich structured their economy. In the red at the top, is the common parlance we see being used today by our world leaders. Below it, I’ve added the new modern examples we see being thrown about these days by the WEF and UN regarding the future they intend on subjugating everyone into. Mind you, these are the same thing in nature, just given a modern polish. For understanding, the “State” means the central government of that nation(s). State and Business Relationship = Public-Private Partnership The National-Socialist conception in Germany subordinates business to the State, where the State controls and rules business. Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State.

Example: China's approach to state-led capitalism is the model the UN and WEF seek to adopt globally, where the government plays a significant role in guiding and controlling key industries to achieve strategic economic goals. Economic Policy Framework = Stakeholder Capitalism Germany maintains a principle of private initiative, but the State intervenes (directed economy) to align business with the welfare of the nation. Example: Nordic countries' social democracies, where private enterprise coexists with robust social safety nets and government interventions to address inequality and promote social welfare. Aims of Production Regulation = Economic Interventionism The Four-Year Plan aims to make Germany less dependent on imports by increasing domestic production. Example: Import substitution policies in various developing countries, aiming to boost domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign goods. Indirect and Direct Regulation of Production = State or Planned Economy Indirect measures include tax reduction, price policy, tariff policy, and control of new private issues on the capital market. Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them.

Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them.

Direct measures involve government orders, capital investment policy, and subsidies to certain industries. Example: Industrial policy in South Korea, which involves a combination of market-oriented strategies and government interventions to promote specific industries. Capital Investment Policy = State Capitalism Capital investment regulation involves prohibitions, government guarantees for profits and sales, and state engagement in certain production areas. Capital investments are prioritized based on urgency, focusing on the Four-Years Plan, rearmament, and exports. Example: Sovereign wealth funds in countries like Norway, where the government directs investments to ensure long-term economic stability and growth. State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries. Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months.

State Intervention = State Subsidies (Bailouts) State intervention includes subsidies, particularly in industries like shipping, to support economic branches deemed desirable by the State. Example: The 2009 trillion-dollar bailout omnibus packages given to national banks, the auto industry, the TARP, and others to prevent them from folding. Regulation of Raw Material Consumption = Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) German industry operates under a system of raw material quotas to control imports, with 27 control boards overseeing various industries.

Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation.

Example: Environmental regulations and quotas on the extraction of natural resources to ensure sustainable practices (SDGs) Regulation of Labor Supply = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) With the elimination of unemployment, the government regulates labor supply through the employment of additional female labor, later retirement, and controlling job changes. Example: Increased federal and corporate are not concerned with how well a person performs, but whether that individual hired helps the organization/corporation achieve its DEI quotas. Increase of Production and Consumption Policy = Universal Basic Income Total industrial production in Germany has increased significantly, with a focus on both consumption and production regulation. Example: Stimulus Checks. Economic stimulus packages deployed during times of economic downturn (e.g., Covid Lockdowns), aiming less to increase production and more for consumer spending. Organized Consumption and Publicity = State Propaganda \"Strength through Joy\" organization plays a crucial role in organized consumption, providing affordable leisure activities for workers. Example: Public health campaigns promoting specific lifestyle choices (ex. Obamacare, masks or vaccine initiatives) that promote a forced activity for societal well-being. When you strip away the highly polished veneer of political language, you see that the initiatives of the Third Reich are all but being championed and enacted again nearly a century later by their predecessors. Most of the communist and fascist regimes have used most, if not all the above to achieve a fraction of success free market capitalism affords. Success comes hard for these ten artificial initiatives because they do not address reality where reality lives: a) human nature is corrupt, selfish, and sinful b) the laws of physics do not obey the laws of man c) TANSTAAFL Thus, the new buzzwords for the global elite these days are simply recycled failed socialist theories: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): this is a redistribution of wealth scheme (from rich nations to poor) that punishes and disincentivizes successful nations and gives to those who have not earned it (thus will not respect it). A nation like China which skyrockets its wealth artificially by corporate espionage, reverse engineering, currency manipulation, etc. in a couple of decades, does not have the same understanding, appreciation, or infrastructure that a nation that has been building its wealth for decades has. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): it is more important to look non-racist than to be racist. Remember, the soft bigotry of low expectations for people of color is another way to keep them enslaved in a victim-mentality system they can never escape from. You don’t need a plantation master with a whip to keep the slaves in line when the prison they enslaved in, is their own minds. Environmental Social Governance (ESG): “refers to \"environmental, social and governance,\" a phrase used by liberals in connection with investing in politically correct companies on the stock market.” This is a catch-all trap that is promoting things like ESG Scores that will one day replace credit scores. In quoting Elon Musk who correctly tweeted, \"The S in ESG stands for satanic.\" (Link) Conclusion IF we think back to the past Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that have transformed our nation (and our world) in the previous global conflicts, it seems only fitting that we should expect a new round of transformative changes given our current trajectory. But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences. Add to that, the dark spiritual components that will be present in ways not seen since before the Noahic flood. All this will mean, the world will be primed for the takeover by the kingdom of the beast. And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them.

But how can it be transformative if the world is simply repackaging the same old, tired lies? Reimagining 20th-century ideologies such as fascism, communism, social Darwinism, cultural Marxism, and eugenics for today's political left is designed to reignite fervor amongst the fanatical post-modernists. Where it differs, is that this new round will employ advanced information systems, technology, and artificial intelligence systems the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be used to suppress opposition, risking even a permanent dystopian or even post-apocalyptic future without consideration of the long-term consequences.

    "description": "No último trimestre de 2023, trio vendeu 16% da participação que mantinha na fabricante global de ketchups e mostardas",
    "published_at": "2024-04-12T17:26:43Z",
    "content": " Metropólesmetropoles.com 12/04/2024 14:26, atualizado 12/04/2024 14:26 Foi sem alarde que a gestora 3G Capital, do trio de bilionários da Americanas formado por Jorge Paulo Lemann, Marcel Telles e Carlos Alberto Sicupira (foto em destaque), deixou desde o último trimestre do ano passado a Kraft Heinz, a gigante americana do ramo de alimentos, que produz o ketchup e a mostarda da marca Heinz. A saída consumou-se após a venda de 16,1% da participação que o trio mantinha na companhia. A informação foi divulgada nesta semana pela rede de TV americana CNBC. O negócio começou em 2013, quando a 3G e a Berkshire Hathaway, liderada pelo megainvestidor Warren Buffett – o sexto homem mais rico do mundo segundo a Forbes –, se uniram para fechar o capital da Heinz. Dois anos depois, ocorreu a fusão com Kraft Foods.  No início, os resultados do conglomerado foram positivos. A 3G entrou na empresa com sua mão pesada nos cortes de custos, uma marca registrada da gestora de private equity, obtendo resultados que à época pareciam promissores. Mas o remédio, se não matou o paciente, teve impacto pouco durador. Em busca de expansão de mercado e novos ganhos de sinergia, a Kraft Heinz tentou comprar a Unilever por US$ 143 bilhões em 2017. A oferta, contudo, foi rejeitada. Nessa época, analistas também passaram a ressaltar que uma parcela dos consumidores estava se voltando para produtos mais saudáveis, uma mudança comportamental que tornava os negócios da empresa menos atrativos no médio e longo prazos. Foi dois anos depois, porém, que a situação se complicou. Em 2019, quase numa só tacada, a empresa anunciou cortes de dividendos, rebaixou o valor das suas marcas em US$ 15 bilhões e informou ao mercado que suas práticas contábeis estavam sob investigação da Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC, a comissão de valores mobiliários dos EUA). Nessa época, Buffett chegou a dizer à CNBC que a Berkshire e a 3G “pagaram caro” pela fabricante dos ketchups, cujas marcas não eram tão valiosas quanto os investidores imaginaram. O fato é que, em 2021, a Kraft Heinz pagou uma multa de US$ 62 milhões para a SEC para encerrar o caso. O acordo incluía o reconhecimento de ações como a assinatura de contratos de fornecedores falsos. A 3G chegou a ter três assentos no conselho de administração da Kraft Heinz. Em 2021, Lemann saiu. No ano seguinte, foi seguido por Alexandre Behring, também sócio e fundador da 3G. Em 2022, a gestora já não tinha representantes no órgão da companhia. No fim de 2023, o trio de brasileiros saiu do negócio. A Berkshire continua como principal acionista com 26,8% do capital da empresa.  Todos os direitos reservados Quais assuntos você deseja receber?

    "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 oversold value stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our overview of what defines an oversold stock and the basics of value investing, then you can take a look at the 5 Oversold Value Stocks To Buy Now.  Analyzing stocks in 2024 is quite different from analyzing them a couple of decades back. In fact, even as early as the early 1990s, traders had significantly lesser amounts of data at their disposal for their trading strategies, as they operated in an era that came to be defined by the rise of quantitative trading through pioneers such as D.E. Shaw of the D. E. Shaw Group and patient value investors like Seth Klarman of Baupost Group and Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway. While quantitative trading is characterized by its data heavy approach that sees hedge funds rely on voluminous amounts of data to make their bets, it's not the only strategy that uses data. Another data intensive approach is called technical trading, and it can be considered a rather distant cousin of quantitative trading. This is because both these strategies rely on statistical concepts such as averages and correlation. However, technical trading relies more on underlying stock movements, and it concerns itself with metrics such as moving averages for share prices, the correlation between share prices and broader stock indexes, the pace of share price movement over a unit time period, and whether a stock is seeing higher buying or selling interest compared to historical data. Measuring the buying or selling interest is officially dubbed as checking whether a stock is overbought or oversold. It is measured through an indicator called the relative strength index (RSI), which is simply a complex ratio of share price gains and losses over a fixed time period. The RSI indicator lets investors potentially determine whether a stock is undersold or oversold and helps them position their portfolios accordingly. An RSI score greater than 70 shows that a stock might be overbought while a reading below 30 shows that it might be oversold. While an RSI reading can indicate an oversold stock that might be ripe for buying, it can also be combined with other indicators. Two such approaches, particularly when evaluating oversold stocks (and oversold value stocks as well), involve the share price and share price moving averages. For the share price, if it is falling and setting new lows while the RSI reading is rising or setting higher new lows, then the price can be construed to potentially rise in the future based on these technical indicators alone. Similarly, a rising RSI coupled with a rising price that crosses moving averages is also used by some to start buying. While oversold stocks are evaluated purely on the basis of their share price dynamics, value stocks evaluate equities with respect to a fair value. If the price is lower than a fair value, then depending on the difference, a trader can buy shares with the hope that they will rise in value over time. This approach is called value investing, and for some value stocks, you can take a look at 13 High Growth Value Stocks to Invest in According to Seth Klarman. The next thing to ask is whether investing in stocks based on technical indicators such as RSI or a value strategy is worth it. Well, for a back of the envelope, we can analyze the performance of oversold stocks and value stocks. We covered these kinds of stocks as part of our overage of 10 Oversold Large Cap Stocks to Buy and 12 Best Value Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2024 (Picked By Seth Klarman). Starting with the oversold stocks, the six month average share price performance of the stocks in this list is 14.9%. In fact, this improves if we remove the latest troubles surrounding Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW)'s shares that sank in April due to a software issue affecting its guidance and earnings. Without $LW, the stocks are up 18% on average. Similarly, for the second list, the 12 value stocks are up by an average of 14.69%, showing that value stocks and oversold stocks, when correctly picked, might end up having a lot of merit. With these details in mind, let's take a look at some oversold value stocks. A couple of notable names are Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW), Perusahaan Perseroan (Persero) PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia Tbk (NYSE:TLK), and Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL). A portfolio manager analyzing a line graph displaying stock performance of the company. Our Methodology To make our list of the oversold value stocks to buy, we chose the stocks with the lowest RSI scores, a price to earnings ratio lower than 15, and average analyst ratings of Buy or better. Only stocks with a market capitalization greater than $300 million were chosen. For these oversold value stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.

    "published_at": "2024-04-12T14:54:50Z",
    "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at billionaire Leon Cooperman's family, children and investments. If you want to skip our detailed overview of one of the most successful billionaires in Wall Street history, then you can skip ahead to Billionaire Leon Cooperman's Family, Children, and Investments: Top 5 Stocks.  When it comes to shrewd takes on the stock market, you're unlikely to find too many that lag behind Leon Cooperman's analysis of the stock market and the broader financial environment in the United States. Over the course of his career, the billionaire has seen it all. An octogenarian, Cooperman started his career in 1967 - an era on Wall Street that was yet to be dominated by mega cap technology stocks. Back then, Wall Street investors were facing their own historic environment. While right now folks in the hedge fund and the broader finance industry are adjusting to an era of high interest rates and the 'end of free money' as Mr. Cooperman would put it, in the late 1960s, they were rejoicing on the Federal Reserve's decision to allow a portion of stock purchases to be funded by taking out loans. Naturally, this meant that more stocks changed hands and the euphoria would continue for the next couple of years until rising costs and dwindling interest led to the government stepping in and helping brokers manage the market. In this turmoil, Cooperman was working for the famed investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) and he would continue to work for the bank until 1991, a period that would see him live through one of the most well known and devastating stock market crashes called Black Monday. A couple of years after Black Monday, Cooperman would leverage the skills he learned while managing stocks for one of the biggest investment banks in the world to try his own hand at wealth and fame by setting up a private investment partnership. While working at Goldman saw the famed investor make his mark on Wall Street by winning laurels, on the personal side, he had already achieved milestones. Characteristic of folks from his generation, even before Cooperman started working for Goldman to set him on a path to becoming one of the richest people in the world, he had already married his wife Toby Cooperman in 1964. Like Cooperman, Mrs. Cooperman also attended New York's Hunter College and graduated in the year of their marriage. During their time in college, the pair were quite close and would take up class positions such as president and vice president. The start of Cooperman senior's journey at Goldman Sachs was accompanied by his six month old toddler, and today, he has two sons, Wayne Cooperman and Michael Cooperman. Both of these have followed their father into the finance industry, and Wayne Cooperman even has his own hedge fund called Cobalt Capital Management. Michael Cooperman, on the other hand, is more involved in his family's charitable endeavors and has been known to work at the Leon & Toby Cooperman Foundation. Cooperman Sr. is quite charitable too, and like several other well known hedge fund and investment professionals such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Mario Gabelli of GAMCO, he has also signed the giving pledge. Wayne's trysts in the finance industry have also generated their fair share of controversy. One infamous period in Cooperman Sr.'s long and illustrious career on Wall Street was in 2010 when he had yet to shut down his investment firm. Back then, the billionaire's investment firm had held a stake in the oil and gas midstream company Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. Atlas announced a $682 million sale of an asset to the Canadian firm Enbridge, and Cooperman Sr. was accused of improperly profiting from the deal by buying more Atlas Pipeline shares with the inside knowledge that the deal would be announced soon. To make things interesting, the accusations tipped off the SEC to investigate Cooperman, who started to look into the matter purportedly after Wayne Cooperman noticed unusual derivative activity for Atlas shares right when the deal was to be announced. In a rather interesting set of events, it appeared as if Cooperman Sr. had raised his son to detest insider trading while all the while trading stocks with inside knowledge himself! The saga lasted for six years, and despite the SEC offering him to settle in return for a five year ban, the investor stood his ground and settled for a fine without admitting to any wrongdoing. Since then, Cooperman shut down his firm in 2018 after he grew tired of the fast paced and stressful nature of professionally investing in stocks. He now invests through his family office Omega Advisors, and according to Insider Monkey's research, Mr. Cooperman's family office had a portfolio value of $2 billion by the end of last year's fourth quarter.

But the Montreal-based company also was carrying a boatload of debt incurred while building those diverse businesses over several decades, especially the billions it poured into developing the C Series passenger jet, launched in 2008 to compete with Boeing and Airbus for commercial airlines orders. By 2018, the financial and operational headwinds became too strong, forcing Bombardier's then-CEO Alain Bellemare to begin shedding key assets, most prominently by selling Airbus the C Series program — rebranded as the popular A220 airline. That was followed by divesting the rest of its commercial aircraft businesses, the Learjet brand of private planes and the railway unit. The recreational products entity, featuring Ski-Doo snowmobiles and Sea-Doo personal watercraft, had been offloaded in 2003. A new management team, headed by CEO Éric Martel and CFO Bart Demosky, took control in 2020. They immediately established an ambitious, five-year strategic plan to reposition Bombardier, with a focus squarely on its sturdiest leg: the high-flying business jet and ancillary services industry. That is proving to be a smart calculation, based not only on Bombardier's almost 40 years of experience in manufacturing and marketing business jets but also the current state of that aviation sector. Deliveries of business and general aviation aircraft last year topped 4,000 for the first time in more than a decade, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association reported in February. When compared to 2022, all aircraft segments saw increases in shipments, and preliminary aircraft deliveries were valued at $27.8 billion, an increase of 3.6%, according to the trade association, adding that business jet deliveries climbed 2.5%. Bombardier's pure-play strategy is based on four key pillars, Demosky said. The first two revolve around its highly regarded Challenger and Global business jets, both new and certified-preowned models, sold to well-heeled individuals, companies and fleet operators such as, Flexjet, Wheels Up and NetJets, the fractional-ownership unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. The third pillar is the worldwide network of aftermarket maintenance and repair centers, and finally the global defense market for retrofitted, special-mission military aircraft. No matter who owns the jets, corporate executives have doing plenty of flying in recent years. Companies in the S&P 500 spent $65 million for bigwigs to use private jets for personal travel in 2022, up about 50% from pre-pandemic levels three years earlier, a Wall Street Journal analysis earlier this year found. CEOs benefited the most, with spending for their aircraft perks reaching a five-year high in 2022, according to executive compensation consultant Equilar. Approximately 45% of Equilar 500 CEOs received aircraft perks in 2022, while only 14.2% of CFOs received the same perk. Of course, when the entire aviation industry was disrupted — and when commercial airlines started flying again later that year with mandated health restrictions, flight delays and airport chaos — individuals and companies that could afford to buy, lease, rent, or share business jets did, and demand soared. The post-Covid peak numbers are expected to moderate, but the growth continue over the longer-term. Honeywell said in a global aviation outlook issued last October that 2023 growth would still be 10% above the 2019 level, and demand for business jets over the next decade should remain strong. Historically, the business jet market has been cyclical, said Noah Poponak, an analyst for Goldman Sachs, \"but it's been hyper-cyclical in the past 20 years.\" He cited the period from 2003 to 2007, when demand was high and OEMs ramped up production, only to be hit by the 2008 financial crisis. Demand collapsed and OEMs significantly cut production, leaving them with a plenty of new and used inventory. Sales of all business jets were healthy leading into 2020 — and then the Covid pandemic hit. The best barometer for the business jet market, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Walter Spracklin, is the percentage of the total global fleet up for resale on the used market, which generally follows overall economic conditions. \"That percentage is typically in the 10% to 12% range,\" he said. \"When it goes into 12% to 15%, that's when we are in recession. Coming out of Covid, it went down to 3%. Everyone wanted a business jet and was willing to buy whatever was out there, new or used.\" Today, the percentage is around 6%, so the demand environment is very strong, Spracklin said. By staying that new course over the past three years, the company has grown revenue and earnings, reduced its massive debt nearly by half and expanded free cash flow. For 2023, Bombardier reported revenues of $8 billion, up 16% year-over-year, driven by higher deliveries and record-setting aftermarket revenues of $1.75 billion, also up 16%. Adjusted EBITDA rose 32% from 2022 to $1.23 billion, while cash flow generation from continuing operations reached $257 million, beating the company's 2023 guidance. \"All of that cash has gone to debt retirement, which went from $10.1 billion in 2020, down to $5.5 billion last year,\" Demosky said. Bombardier delivered more aircraft than any of its peers in 2023, Demosky said, referring to OEM competitors such as Gulfstream, Embraer, Dassault and Textron. Poponak concurred, and then some. \"Bombardier has been closer to their delivery targets than anybody over the last three years,\" he said. For 2021, the company estimated that it would deliver between 110 and 120 jets and it hit the 120 mark. For 2022, the target was 120 jets and 124 were delivered, and last year it reached the set goal of 138 deliveries. The estimate for this year is between 150 and 155 deliveries. The pandemic upended a lot of things for Bombardier, Demosky said. Martel had been with the company from 2002 to 2015. He was president of the business jet unit when he left to run Hydro-Québec until 2020. Coincidentally, his first day as CEO was just as the world shut down, halting Bombardier's production facilities in Canada. \"When we came back a few months later, the world had changed,\" Demosky said, notably severe interruptions throughout supply chains. \"Many of our peers reduced their supply chain capabilities, but we made the decision to increase ours,\" based on anticipating an incremental demand for business jets coming out of the pandemic. \"Being proactive allowed us to get ahead of the curve with supply chain challenges and able to meet commitments on deliveries and grow our business more rapidly and effectively than our peers,\" the CFO said. Bombardier produces three versions of two classes of business jets, the mid-size Challenger and the large-cabin, long-range Global. The largest and fastest is the 19-passenger Global 7500, capable of speeds up to Mach 0.925. An upgraded 8000 model is scheduled for release later this year. \"Order activity remains very strong for both the Challenger and the Global [models],\" Demosky said. \"We are either number one or two in terms of sales and deliveries of medium and large aircraft in every geographic segment.\" To help keep that growing fleet in the air, the company has expanded its aftermarket service business, now operating 10 centers spread across the U.S., Europe and Asia, and projected to generate $2 billion in revenues this year, Demosky said. Another growth opportunity is the defense segment, which for close to 30 years has sold jets to air forces around the world. \"We made the strategic decision a few years ago to invest in our capability to grow that business, not only in delivery of aircraft, but in providing other value-added services — maintenance, engineering services and modification services,\" he said. Bombardier heads into the final stretch of its five-year transformation having achieved demonstrable success as a stand-alone business jet company. Yet feedback from investors \"has been very interesting,\" Spracklin said. \"Many, particularly Canadian investors, have had a storied past with this company, so early on, buying back into Bombardier had been met with some skepticism, but they're converting those skeptics. It's a work in progress, but one that is going in the right direction.\" Poponak offered a similar assessment. \"Overall, the investment community hasn't fully come around,\" he said. \"Any time a company and a stock go through a long period of challenges, having done some things wrong, even after they fix the issues and make it a good business, the market feels like it needs to see a multi-year window of consistently delivering [positive results] before it will divorce the company from its past. Investors are coming around, but it will probably be a few more years before they're fully out of that,\" he said. Although Bombardier's stock has fluctuated over the past 52 weeks, from a high of around $54 last March to a low of almost $30 in October, the company can achieve less than their guidance and still have their stock go up this year, he said. Demosky acknowledges that at the beginning of the repositioning, \"there were doubters about whether we could turn the company around and perform as well as we believed we could,\" he said. \"I'm pleased to say that those naysayers are now few and far between. We've met or beat guidance over the past 13 quarters, so I think we have the track record to support the view that we can perform. Our job is just to keep executing.\" Got a confidential news tip?

O trio da 3G Capital se comprometeu a fazer um aporte de R$ 12 bilhões na varejista em recuperação judicial, movimento que ocorreu em meio à saída discreta da fabricante de alimentos. Com o fim de um negócio iniciado nove anos atrás, resta saber se o aporte da 3G ajudará a tirar a Americanas da crise, após o escândalo que arranhou sua imagem. Esta semana, a varejista divulgou que vai propor aos acionistas um aumento de capital de até R$ 41 bilhões, em assembleia no dia 10 de maio.  Além dos R$ 12 bilhões da 3G, bancos credores devem aportar outros R$ 12 bilhões. O restante pode vir de uma capitalização, que aconteceria pela emissão de novas ações, caso os acionistas aprovem um aumento de capital maior. Continua depois da publicidade Se mantido no valor atual, o aporte da 3G na Americanas vai levar a uma grande diluição  do capital social da varejista, fazendo com que a participação da 3G passe dos cerca de 30% para quase 50%. Em evento na Brazil Conference, em Harvard e no MIT, no final da última semana, Lemann reconheceu os erros na gestão da Americanas e disse que está tenta salvar a companhia. “O dinheiro [da 3G] vai trazer um forte alívio de caixa no curto prazo, mas não vai ajudar a recuperar a credibilidade perdida”, avalia Marcos Rodrigues, da MRD Consulting, para quem é difícil prever quanto tempo será necessário para tirar a empresa da crise. Continua depois da publicidade Veio a público somente esta semana que a 3G Capital vendeu toda a participação de 16,1% que tinha na Kraft Heinz. Isso teria acontecido no último trimestre de 2023, em um movimento silencioso, reportou na quarta-feira (10) o veículo de notícias financeiras CNBC.  A fabricante de alimentos tem como acionista de referência a Berkshire Hathaway, de Warren Buffett, com 26,8% do bolo.  Antes de zerar sua posição na empresa, o fundo de Lemann já vinha promovendo saídas graduais da Kraft, enquanto se distanciava das operações. Continua depois da publicidade “A 3G não está envolvida na gestão da Kraft Heinz, nem faz parte do Conselho há vários anos. Eles continuaram a ser investidores e foram tratados como tratamos todos os outros”, disse a Kraft Heinz, em nota à CNBC. “Soubemos por meio de comunicado enviado recentemente que a 3G saiu completamente da Kraft Heinz em 2023”, disse a nota. O trio ingressou na Kraft nove anos atrás, mas desde então a empresa vinha passando por denúncias de falsificação de contratos e também foi confrontada, em 2019, por inconsistIencias contábeis, com lucros considerados inflados. Na visão de Alexandre Di Miceli, fundador da Virtuous Company e autor de “Ética Empresarial na Prática”, a saída da Kraft Heinz “foi um atestado do fracasso da 3G” em seu modelo de gestão baseado em transferência de valor. “Já deu sinais claros de esgotamento”, comentou ao IM Business. \n                                        A executiva começou na empresa logo após o pedido de recuperação judicial por causa da fraude contábil que atingiu R$ 25 bilhões                                     \n                                        Fatia era de 16,1%; firma de private equity não estava envolvida na gestão da empresa                                     \n\n                    Taís Laporta                \n \n"

    "title": "Short-seller sends Globe Life shares plunging 53% as insurance giant calls report 'defamatory,' threatens legal action",
    "description": "Fuzzy Panda report describes Globe Life subsidiary AIL as a \"pyramid scheme\" with \"exhaustive array of financial malfeasance.\"",
    "published_at": "2024-04-12T02:04:11Z",
    "content": "       Shares of insurance giant Globe Life Inc. plunged 53% today and trading was halted eight times after a short-seller issued a damning narrative on the company. In a 36-page investigative report, Fuzzy Panda Research described \"extensive allegations of insurance fraud\" at Globe's wholly-owned subsidiary American Income Life, repeatedly citing Business Insider's coverage. Last year, BI reported that agents at a leading AIL sales agency, the Pittsburgh-based Arias Organization, had forged signatures and opened accounts in the names of dead people. Today's short seller report says \"dozens of former executives and agents told us that the problems of fraudulent insurance production for Globe Life is an AIL problem, not limited to Arias\" and claims Fuzzy Panda uncovered allegations of fraud at many of AIL's largest agencies. Globe issued a statement after the close of trading calling the Fuzzy Panda report \"wildly misleading\" and saying the company \"strives to act in accordance with the highest level of ethics and integrity at all levels of the organization and to comply with all government regulations.\" The company said it intends to \"more fully rebut\" allegations in the report soon and will \"explore all means of legal recourse.\" Fuzzy Panda sent people undercover to apply for jobs at AIL agencies. They reported back that one recruiter had a criminal record, another suggested the applicant use a fake address to avoid seeking a license in a state where standards were high, and a third appeared to offer cocaine if the recruit had great sales in his first week. The report also said Globe and AIL executives directed recruits to a single company for exam prep — Xcel Testing. Fuzzy Panda cited a 2022 lawsuit filed against AIL, Globe Life, and other parties by an Xcel competitor that estimated that AIL managers had made at least $43 million in Xcel \"kickbacks.\" (Globe Life, AIL, and the other defendants denied the allegation in a legal filing.) The report describes \"an exhaustive array of financial malfeasance\" that took hold once CEO Steve Greer and President Dave Zophin took over AIL in 2017 and 2018. It characterizes AIL as a \"pyramid scheme\" where agencies were incentivized to write more and more bad policies each year to fuel growth. \"If you thought it could not get any worse,\" Fuzzy Panda writes, \"American Income Life has also fostered an environment permissive of sexual assault, rape, racism, and widespread illicit drug activity.\" Trina Orlando, a spokesperson for Arias and the Arias Organization, said Arias is \"deeply troubled by the inaccurate and false statements\" in the Fuzzy Panda report. The report mentions several other lawsuits, including the shocking sexual assault and sexual harassment complaints of a former Arias agent, Renee Zinsky, first reported by BI. Zinsky told Fuzzy Panda that favored agents had special access to customer information that allowed them to put through charges for new policies without customers' knowledge. Zinsky had sued AIL, Arias Agencies (now the Arias Organization), Simon Arias, her boss Michael Russin, and his companies in federal court in 2022 over sexual harassment, sexual assault, and job misclassification, but AIL and Arias prevailed in a motion to remove Zinsky's complaint to private arbitration, where a protective order, her attorney Amy Williamson said, has kept all aspects of the proceedings hidden from view. On March 3, the eve of the arbitration hearing, Zinsky withdrew her claims against AIL and Arias, surrendering her ability to bring them in any legal forum, according to court documents and a regulatory filing by Globe. The American Arbitration Association panel dismissed the case on March 4. There was never a hearing on the merits. Zinsky's claims against Russin remain in federal court; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission separately reopened an investigation into her charges after BI's reports appeared. \n                              Related stories\n                             Last October, Pennsylvania's insurance regulators fined AIL $130,000 for engaging in deceptive consumer practices; in March, BI reported that the Department of Justice had subpoenaed Globe and AIL, seeking information about Arias. Meanwhile, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold all 6.35 million shares of Globe Life stock the investor once held. Zinsky's withdrawal from arbitration appears to have been a tactical effort to prevent disclosure of her settlement negotiations with Russin. On March 3, the day before the hearing was to begin, Zinsky's attorneys learned the arbitrators had subpoenaed Russin and demanded that he share a confidential document when he arrived to testify. That document contained information about settlement negotiations he and Zinsky had agreed to keep confidential, according to a transcript of a March 4 arbitration meeting. John Kane, a lawyer for Zinsky, said he did not want her to be forced to break that confidentiality agreement when it was her turn to testify. Russin's Pittsburgh lawyer, Matthew D. Gailey, did not respond to an inquiry. The night before, facing the 11th-hour subpoena, Zinsky's lawyers withdrew her claim. Williamson told BI that the decision came against a backdrop of arbitration proceedings where her client, Zinsky, wasn't treated fairly. \"I'm not able to speak in detail about the arbitration proceedings, but if the public knew what did transpire, they would be appalled and conclude there is no due process,\" she said. Michael Clark, a spokesperson for AAA, said in an email that it is AAA's policy not to comment on its cases. AAA does not require proceedings to be confidential. But Williamson said that in this case a broad protective order prohibits Zinsky or her lawyers from saying anything about details of the case. \"AIL's focus was silencing Renee much more than addressing the merits of her case,\" Williamson said. \"AIL was silencing her in every way they could.\" Globe Life spokesperson Jennifer Haworth did not respond to queries about Zinksy's case. AIL and Russin sought to obtain the names of BI's sources through filing motions in the Zinsky case and in another arbitration concerning sexual assault and racism brought by Abeni Mayfield, an agent who worked out of an Arias office in Columbia, Maryland. In the Zinsky case, Russin asked Zinsky to \"identify each and every individual that you are aware spoke with Susan Antilla in preparation of the Insider article.\" In the Mayfield case, AIL asked arbitrators to order the production of \"all communications between claimant and Susan Antilla\" and \"all communications between claimant's counsel and Susan Antilla,\" according to a letter Williamson sent to an AAA arbitrator in December. Williamson said the only communications Zinsky handed over were text messages she exchanged with BI. Orlando, the Arias spokesperson, called it \"disappointing\" that Zinsky \"is still publicly speaking on her claims which so completely lacked merit she refused to have them heard.\" Orlando said the company intended to \"aggressively pursue all parties who continue to defame and spread false allegations related to Arias and the Arias Organization.\" Williamson said the federal court case against Russin \"is still pending and we are moving forward.\" The EEOC investigation into Zinsky's claims against AIL, Arias, and Russin appears to be still underway; Williamson said she spoke about the case with an investigator at the agency as recently as last week. An email from the EEOC to attorneys in the Mayfield case, obtained by BI, says the agency also reopened an investigation into her allegations of sexual assault and other charges at Arias. Globe has publicly challenged BI's reporting. In a statement to the online financial publication Seeking Alpha, Globe said that short-seller Nate Koppikar, who had recommended Globe as a short sale at an April 3 investment conference, had cited \"conclusions\" in BI's reporting that were \"inaccurate and misleading.\" Globe made similar comments to Reuters on April 4, but Haworth, the spokesperson, did not respond to a request for comment on Koppikar's report. During an earnings call with investors on February 8, Globe co-CEO J. Matthew Darden said that \"an online publication\" had posted stories about legal cases against AIL and one of its state general agents and \"vigorously\" disputed the allegations. A key allegation against the defendants, though, was Zinsky's claim of sexual harassment by Russin, which AIL appeared to corroborate in a September 2023 letter to the EEOC. In that letter, obtained by BI, the company said it had investigated Zinsky's allegations and \"based on the investigation, AIL terminated Mr. Russin's contract.\" Neither Globe Life, nor AIL, nor Arias has requested any corrections in relation to BI's reporting. In Zinsky's recently dismissed arbitration case, AIL and Arias asked the arbitrators to say the case was decided on its merits and to force Zinsky to pay their legal fees. The arbitrators declined. But in its statement to Seeking Alpha, Globe falsely claimed that Zinsky's allegations \"were dismissed because they lacked merit\" and thus AIL felt \"vindicated\" by the outcome. (Seeking Alpha later scrubbed that portion of the statement; Williamson, Zinsky's attorney, said she had contacted the publication to point out the error.) Globe's stock has declined 62% since BI reported on March 6 that the Department of Justice had sent subpoenas to Globe and AIL seeking information about Arias. The decline accelerated as short-sellers went public with their views. Koppikar told BI that, after today's price move, \"both the board and the insurance regulators will likely need to take action to address the concerns raised in the various reports that have surfaced in the past year.\" In his April 3 presentation to investors, Koppikar called Globe Life \"a dead-end pyramid scheme.\" \"The allegations from BI's reporting are damning,\" he said, adding that he couldn't understand why money managers who \"preach the gospel of ESG\" still own Globe shares. He predicted that the DOJ investigation will hinder recruiting, \"which is the lifeblood for pyramid schemes like Globe Life.\" \n                              Read next\n                             Jump to"

    "published_at": "2024-04-13T14:24:18Z",
    "content": "After more than a year of increasingly contentious negotiations, pilots at the world's largest private jet operator have overwhelmingly approved a revised contract. Members of the NetJets Association of Shared Aircraft Pilots voted 78.31% to 21.69% to ratify the agreement. The results were communicated in an internal memo from NJASAP to members last night and first reported by Private Jet Card Comparisons. In total, 2,390 pilots voted in favor of the deal versus 662 against it. Overall, 98% of eligible union members participated, a record. Pilots at NetJets overwhelmingly approved a new employment agreement that will give them $1.6 ... [+] billion of incremental benefits through 2029. The deal gives pilots a 52.5% increase in compensation through 2029, when the contract expires. NJASAP had told members the mid-contract deal would give them a net increase in compensation of $1.6 billion, an average of $400,000 per pilot, during the agreement's term. The union said it had rebuffed management attempts to strike a longer deal. NJASAP had said that without a raise, pilots would leave for better-paying jobs at the major airlines. They were seeking wage parity with those pilots. Management had countered that was not having issues with attrition or hiring new pilots. In January, it implemented an age 70 retirement age. In the end, the pilots settled for closing the gap. \"When the last base pay increase is added to pilot pay on May 1, 2029, the pay gap between NetJets and major airlines will be reduced from the current 60% to 4.6% for large-cabin captains and 17.6% for small-cabin captains,\" the union had told members before the vote. Pilot wage tables showed base wages ranging from $86,000 to over $400,000. The deal comes as NetJets plans to ramp up deliveries of new aircraft. It has signed letters of intent with Embraer and Textron Aviation for massive numbers of new private jets. Its deal with the Brazilian OEM calls for buying up to 250 of its midsize Praetor 500s. The agreement with Textron's Cessna Aircraft unit could see the Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary buy up to 1,500 business jets. Under the NetJets model, it resells the airplanes to fractional owners who buy shares starting at 1/16th of a specific aircraft. That gives them up to 50 flight hours per year, and contracts that run for five years. At the end of the contract, NetJets buys back their share at current market rates. Owners also pay a monthly management fee to NetJets which operates the fleet. Frequent flyers often buy quarter and half shares, and corporate flight departments needing supplemental lift purchase shares in multiple aircraft types. The fractional owners are guaranteed flights at contracted rates with as little as six hours' notice on their aircraft type. They are also guaranteed downgrades to other types in the fleet when they wish, while upgrades are subject to availability. The deal ends a year of increasingly hostile negotiations. In December, NJASAP began targeting Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett with a series of ads in The Wall Street Journal. Management alleged the union was engaging in self-help negotiating tactics by increasing delays via increased fatigue calls and maintenance delays. NJASAP countered calling management tactics “a grave threat to the safety culture” at the private airline. If the nastiness had continued, it could have jeopardized NetJets' position as a safe harbor for private flyers who often pay a premium to fly with the private jet leader. "

    "title": "How Most Billionaires Made Their Money",
    "description": "There are many routes to making the billionaires list. Some are more likely than others.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-13T10:00:00Z",
    "content": "You don’t have to be a finance whiz to make Forbes’ World’s Billionaires list, but it sure does help. While people have gotten super-rich in everything from soy sauce to palm oil to damaged cars, being in finance, whether private equity or hedge funds or venture capital, is the most common way the world’s wealthiest got so rich. In fact, nearly one in six billionaires, or just over 15%, made their money in finance and investments: these 427 individuals hail from countries as mixed as Estonia, Kazakhstan, Japan and the U.S. That’s up from the 372 names a year ago and includes 37 newcomers including Ben Navarro, founder of Sherman Financial Group (who is worth an estimated $1.5 billion), Cristina Junqueira of the Brazil-based digital bank Nubank ($1.4 billion) and Antonio Gracias, founder and CEO of Valor Equity Partners ($1.1 billion). These billionaires—who also include bankers, fintech founders and full-time investors—are worth $2.17 trillion in all. Nearly two-thirds are richer than in 2023, no one more than Warren Buffett, who added $27 billion to his net worth thanks to record-high share prices for his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway. Technology, meanwhile, yielded 342 billionaires, making it the second-most popular industry for billionaires, up by 29 people—and up one spot in industries—from last year. Jeff Bezos remains the richest tech tycoon (Forbes classifies Elon Musk, who owes much of his wealth to electric carmaker Tesla, as primarily an automotive billionaire). He’s followed by Mark Zuckerberg, whose wealth leapt by a list-leading $116.2 billion to an estimated $177 billion as of March 8 when the list was locked in. Collectively, tech billionaires are the richest among industries, worth an aggregate $2.6 trillion, more than $430 billion than the next-richest group, finance and investments. The third most common sector for billionaires is manufacturing, which produced 328 members of the three-comma club and the most newcomers this year (49), hailing from countries such as Cyprus, Indonesia and Brazil. The wealthiest among the new manufacturing entrants were Albert Chao, James Chao and Dorothy Chao Jenkins, siblings who own stakes in the U.S.-based Westlake Corporation, a producer of low-density polyethylene used for food packaging and other forms of plastic. Another notable newcomer was Don Levin, founder of D.R.L. Enterprises, the company behind the popular tobacco rolling paper brands E-Z Wider, OCB and JOB. Fashion and retail comes in fourth, with 285 billionaires, including newcomer Christian Louboutin, founder of the famed red-sole shoes worn by the likes of Taylor Swift, Heidi Klum and Lenny Kravtiz. Food and beverage counts 210 billionaires, making it the fifth-largest sector, with new faces that include Todd Graves of fast-food chain Raising Cane’s. Richest: Warren Buffett ($133 billion), chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. Richest: Jeff Bezos ($194 billion), founder of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post and rocket company Blue Origin. Richest: Reinhold Wuerth & family ($33.6 billion), chairman of screw and fastener maker Wuerth Group. Richest: Bernard Arnault & family ($233 billion), chairman and CEO of luxury goods company LVMH and the world’s richest person. Richest: Zhong Shanshan ($62.3 billion), chairman of bottled water company Nongfu Spring. He also controls the publicly-listed Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy. Richest: Mukesh Ambani ($116 billion), chairman of Reliance Industries, which holds interests in petrochemicals, oil and gas, retail and telecommunications. Richest: Dilip Shanghvi ($22.6 billion), founder and managing director of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, India's most valuable listed pharmaceuticals company. Richest: Lee Shau Kee ($27.7 billion), Sun Hung Kai and Henderson Land Development, two of Hong Kong’s largest property developers. Richest: Rupert Murdoch & family ($19.5 billion), chairman emeritus of News Corp., one of the world’s largest media conglomerates. Richest: Harold Hamm & family ($18.5 billion), founder and chairman of Continental Resources, one of the biggest independent oil companies in the U.S. "

    "title": "‘Car insurance is a scam’: Frustrated driver slams GEICO for 56% rate hike after she failed to read the ‘fine print’ on her policy",
    "description": "This TikTok user has had enough and is canceling her policy.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-13T09:58:00Z",
    "content": "For premium support please call: An angry driver has taken to TikTok to brand car insurance a “scam” after she received a huge increase to her monthly bill — despite not having any accidents. TikTok user Ayrial (@ayrial.dan) vented her frustration on the video-sharing platform after her car insurance bill with GEICO jumped from $129 to $202 — a whopping $73 (or 56%) monthly increase. Commercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger Cost-of-living in America is still out of control — use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says Car insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year — but you can be smarter than that. Here's how you can save yourself as much as $820 annually in minutes (it's 100% free) When she called up GEICO — which is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway — she was told the hike was due to her poor performance in the insurer’s DriveEasy program. This tipped her over the edge, causing Ayrial to declare “car insurance is a scam” and that she is “canceling [her policy] this month.” Here’s what happened — and why the cost of auto insurance keeps going up. Most drivers who buy car insurance from GEICO are able to participate in DriveEasy, a safe-driving program that rewards or penalizes drivers based on their driving behavior. Using sensors in your phone, DriveEasy automatically logs your driving behaviors — like how fast and far you drive, how hard you brake and how often you use your phone — and calculates a safe driving score. GEICO then factors your score into your insurance rate (either with a discount or a price hike) upon renewal. This is supposed to incentivize drivers to practice safe habits on the road — but it can also catch bad drivers, as Ayrial found out. Her problem with that was, as she claimed in her TikTok, she wasn't always the one driving. To protect herself from a bad driving score, Ayrial said a GEICO customer service rep told her she should have switched her DriveEasy app settings to ‘passenger’ mode every time she got a ride with somebody else. “That’s extra work for me. I don’t understand,” she said, adding that she didn’t “read the fine print” on her policy, which explained how the safe-driving app impacts insurance rates. As such, Ayrial claimed the “huge increase” in her bill from $129 to $202 is uncalled for. “Give me a base pay and that’s what I pay,” she said. “If I’m not in an accident, it shouldn’t be extra. That’s like when you’re sick, you pay extra for health insurance. I’m not sick!” Read more: These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how While Ayrial’s car insurance rate increase was allegedly deemed a direct result of her driving score, many other drivers across the country have seen frustrating rate increases in recent years as a result of broader insurance market trends. There are several factors driving up the cost of car insurance — from an increase in accident claims, litigation and medical costs for insurers to pay out (and price for), to higher repair costs due to inflation in the price of new and used vehicles, car parts and labor. There is one silver lining to this dark cloud, which is that car prices are moderating after exploding by record amounts during the COVID-19 pandemic. While auto insurance costs jumped by 22.2% last month from a year earlier, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data, new vehicle prices actually declined 0.1% and used prices dropped 2.2% over the same period.

    "title": "Planning A Vacation? Here’s Your 2024 Summer Travel Insurance Guide",
    "description": "More than 9 out of 10 Americans say they'll travel more this year, according to a recent survey. If you're one of them, you'll probably need travel insurance.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-13T09:44:36Z",
    "content": "The joy of a summer vacation. But do you have protection for your trip? Planning a vacation this summer? Yeah, you and just about everyone else. More than 9 out of 10 Americans say they'll travel more this year, according to a recent Nationwide Travel Insurance survey. Most of those trips will happen in June, July and August. Not just that, but 40 percent of the respondents say they'll spend more this year than last year. So how do you protect your vacation investment? Travel insurance is the standard answer, but what kind of insurance — and how do you find it? That's the question many Americans are wrestling with as they make their travel plans. Protecting your vacation is a serious concern this summer, experts say. “Travelers are beefing up their trip protection with security advisory and extraction protection,\" notes Dan Richards, CEO of The Global Rescue Companies. It's not just that they're spending more. It's that there's more to lose. The ongoing war in Ukraine, the Hamas attacks on Israel, and other violent conflicts have made travel insurance a key part of trip planning. This summer may break travel records, experts say. Overall policy sales for the 2024 summer travel season are up this year, but there's a spike in sales for policies in August, which is typically the busiest time of the summer. \"Sales are up more than 25% over last year,\" says Stan Sandberg, co-founder of travel insurance site TravelInsurance.com. Western Europe continues to be the most popular summer destination for Americans, with some notable hotspots. Travel insurance sales for Greece are up over 60% this year compared with 2023, followed by Norway and Portugal, which are up 57% and 52%, respectively, according to Sandberg. Everyone's travel insurance needs are different, according to the pros. Laura Heidt, the insurance desk manager for Brownell Travel in Birmingham, Ala., says there are some things every travel insurance policy should cover this summer. \"I always recommend people insure for the unexpected, such as flight delays, missed connections and medical coverage while out of the country,\" she says. \"If you are willing to forgo the cancellation and delay coverages, which are typically the most expensive parts of a policy, you should still, absolutely, cover yourself with at least the medical component.\" Heidt says she's seen a 10% boost in travel insurance sales for this summer compared with the same time last year, and many people are opting for the pricier \"cancel for any reason\" policies, which allow you to cancel your trip and receive a partial refund of your prepaid, nonrefundable travel expenses. Travel insurance companies are seeing a similar trend. \"A majority of travelers choose a comprehensive travel insurance plan which includes coverage for trip cancellation, emergency medical, lost or delayed baggage and delay,\" explains Tim Dodge, vice president of marketing at Arch RoamRight. He says this year, travelers are purchasing travel insurance on average within 11 days of their trip deposit to receive the additional benefit of the waiver exclusion for pre-existing conditions. If you're traveling with kids, you'll need extra travel insurance protection. Travel insurance comes in all shapes and sizes. So you'll want to try a few on for size before you buy. You can actually do that, since most policies have a \"free look\" period that makes them fully refundable for the first week or two (depending on the policy). \"It's important to consider your specific travel plans and any potential disruptions in order to protect your investment,\" says Robert Gallagher, president of the US Travel Insurance Association (USTIA). He says traditional plans offer coverage for unexpected cancellations, interruptions, delays, emergency medical expenses and lost or delayed baggage. For international travel, USTIA advises opting for a plan with emergency medical and medical evacuation coverage. It also depends on who you're traveling with. For example, if you're traveling with your children, you'll want to consider a family-friendly priced travel insurance plan. But your destination also matters, says Carol Mueller, vice president at Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection (BHTP). \"For young families, I typically recommend the ExactCare plan due to its pricing of two children at no additional cost for every one adult on the policy,\" she says. \"However, for families venturing abroad, I’d suggest considering a plan like BHTP's LuxuryCare, which is designed to meet the distinctive needs of a high-investment vacation.” You have choices when it comes to family coverage. For example, Allianz’s OneTrip Prime plan also includes coverage for kids 17 and younger when traveling with a parent or grandparent. Medical evacuations can be expensive. Mike Hallman, CEO of the air medical transport and travel security program Medjet, says MedjetHorizon memberships are selling briskly. They offer 24/7 security and crisis response, as well as transportation to a hospital at home if you're injured. Travelers are skittish even if they aren't going bungee-jumping. \"With geopolitical tensions still growing — all the riots in France, Italy, Ecuador and other tourist destinations over the last year — and crime causing the threat level to be raised for the Bahamas and Jamaica, it’s no wonder,\" he adds. He makes a good point. Travel insurance can cover many of the events you're likely to encounter, such as a missed connection, lost luggage or a medical emergency. But it's also important to know what isn't covered — and to make plans accordingly. The summer travel season is still a few months away, but insurance experts are worried. Yes, they've seen a general uptick in insurance sales, but some travelers remain unprotected. \"We've started to see early signs that travelers are exercising less caution and are slightly less likely to sign up for travel insurance,\" says Joe Cronin, CEO of International Citizens Insurance. By comparison, travelers purchased plenty of medical insurance in 2020 and 2021 because of the pandemic. Cronin believes travelers were terrified of getting stuck with COVID-19 in a foreign country without insurance. \"To those who are thinking about traveling internationally without travel insurance, my recommendation is to spend a few minutes looking deeper before deciding,\" he adds. Some types of insurance, such as a standalone medical policy, cost just a few dollars a day. A medical evacuation membership is also affordable. And even full-featured travel insurance policies can be cost-effective when you consider the benefits. \"Don’t put your summer travel memories, or your investment, at risk by forgoing the right vacation coverage,\" says Daniel Durazo, director of communications at Allianz Partners USA. \"With international travel peaking during the summer season, an unprotected trip can leave travelers on the hook for costs resulting from an unexpected trip delay or medical emergency abroad.\" Bottom line: Seriously consider travel insurance to protect your trip — and don't be overconfident. You never know what might happen this summer. "

    "content": "Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway has made a notable addition to its investment portfolio by acquiring 1,134,331 shares of Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMK) on April 12, 2024. This transaction has increased Berkshire's total holdings in the company to 69,044,244 shares, reflecting a 0.51% position in the portfolio and a significant 21.14% stake in the traded stock. The shares were purchased at a price of $25.85, slightly above the current market price of $25.42. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with LSXMK. Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), often referred to as \"The Oracle of Omaha,\" is a legendary figure in the investment world. As the Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett transformed a modest textile company into a global conglomerate with a focus on insurance and other diverse investments. A disciple of Benjamin Graham, Buffett's value investing strategy emphasizes long-term growth, intrinsic value, and a strong margin of safety. His investment decisions are closely watched by investors globally, and his portfolio includes major holdings in technology and financial services sectors, with top positions in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), American Express Co (NYSE:AXP), and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). Liberty SiriusXM Group, operating primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom, is a leading provider of satellite radio services. The company's business is divided into segments including Sirius XM Holdings, Formula 1, and Braves Group. With a market capitalization of $8.31 billion and a PE Ratio of 11.45, Liberty SiriusXM Group is considered modestly undervalued with a GF Value of $30.84. The stock's current price to GF Value ratio stands at 0.82, indicating potential for growth. The recent acquisition by Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) has a minor impact on Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio with a 0.01% trade impact. However, the substantial 21.14% ownership in Liberty SiriusXM Group signifies a strong conviction in the stock's value and future prospects. This move aligns with Buffett's strategy of investing in companies with favorable long-term outlooks and solid business models. Liberty SiriusXM Group's stock is currently trading at $25.42, slightly below the trade price of $25.85. The stock is deemed modestly undervalued with a GF Value of $30.84, suggesting room for potential appreciation. Despite a year-to-date price decline of 11.67%, the stock has seen a 19.01% increase since its IPO, indicating resilience and long-term growth. Liberty SiriusXM Group's financial health and growth prospects are reflected in its GF Score of 79/100, indicating good potential for outperformance. The company's Profitability Rank is solid at 7/10, and its Growth Rank stands at 5/10. However, its Financial Strength could be a concern with a Balance Sheet Rank of 4/10 and a low Cash to Debt ratio of 0.03. In the media-diversified industry, Liberty SiriusXM Group holds a competitive position. The stock's Momentum Rank is impressive at 9/10, suggesting strong recent performance relative to its peers. The company's focus on satellite radio services sets it apart in a rapidly evolving media landscape. Aside from Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), other notable investors such as Seth Klarman (Trades, Portfolio), Wallace Weitz (Trades, Portfolio), and Mario Gabelli (Trades, Portfolio) also hold shares in Liberty SiriusXM Group. Their involvement underscores the stock's appeal to value-oriented investors seeking long-term growth opportunities.

    "title": "‘Warren Buffett do bitcoin’, Michael Saylor vê mundo refém da inflação",
    "description": "No Brasil, empresário afirma que criptomoeda representa tudo o que megainvestidor da bolsa sempre pregou",
    "published_at": "2024-04-14T11:35:07Z",
    "content": "  14/04/2024 08h35    Atualizado  14/04/2024       Uma das personalidades mais controversas da cena “tech”, o bilionário americano Michael Saylor, fundador da MicroStrategy — empresa de software corporativo que se “reinventou” na pandemia investindo o próprio caixa em criptomoeda — se considera uma espécie de “Warren Buffett do bitcoin”. Assim como o megainvestidor da Berkshire Hathaway faz com ações de empresas, ele compra a criptomoeda para “nunca mais vendê-la”, apostando na “valorização infinita” do bitcoin.   “Warren Buffet comprou ações da Coca-Cola há 40 anos e da Apple há seis. Seu trabalho é apenas decidir comprar alguma coisa boa que dure. Nossa estratégia é comprar bitcoin e esperar. Só que bitcoin vai durar muito mais do que a Coca-Cola. O bitcoin representa tudo o que Buffett pregou durante toda a sua vida”, diz Saylor ao Valor.   A lógica é que, como se trata de um ativo de reserva de valor escasso, o mundo precisará se refugiar no tal “ouro digital” para se proteger da inflação. “E a inflação só vai aumentar”, afirma, lançando mão de equações matemáticas de sua época de engenharia aeronáutica no MIT (Instituto Tecnológico de Massachusetts). A MicroStrategy será então um bunker virtual com toneladas de bitcoins.   O raciocínio não chega a ser diferente do de outra vertical de negócios da MicroStrategy, também baseada na “escassez”, que cedo comprou os mais variados domínios de endereços na internet — caso de nomes como Voice.com, vendido em 2020 por US$ 30 milhões, o maior valor já transacionado e que permitiu iniciar as compras de bitcoin.  “Bitcoin é o dinheiro perfeito. É como se Deus descesse do céu e dissesse a você: vou criar um sistema de registro imutável, compartilhado, com não mais que 21 milhões de unidades e vou manter seu dinheiro no ciberespaço. Ninguém nunca vai te enganar. Você vai poder mover telepaticamente as moedas e elas durarão um milhão de anos”, diz.   “Mas na ausência de Deus administrando o sistema monetário perfeito do céu, a segunda melhor coisa seria criarmos um software que fizesse essa mesma coisa. É o bitcoin.”   Diferentemente de outros entusiastas cripto, Saylor diz não estar ansioso com o valor que o bitcoin atingirá nos próximos dias após o chamado “halving”, evento programado para o fim desta semana, que reduzirá pela metade a recompensa dos mineradores e que costuma impulsionar preços. “Com certeza vai ultrapassar o recorde histórico [US$ 73.724], talvez chegue a US$ 100 mil no fim do ano.”   Da mesma forma, afirma não ter se abatido quando a criptomoeda derreteu no último “inverno cripto”, implicando prejuízo de mais de US$ 1 bilhão à empresa. O episódio lhe custou o posto de o mais longevo CEO de tecnologia da Nasdaq, título obtido ainda nos anos 90, antes da bolha das pontocom. Alguns observadores inclusive relacionam o início do estouro da bolha da internet ao colapso de 62% das ações da MicroStrategy em março de 2000, em meio ao um escândalo de revisão contábil que rendeu processo da SEC (CVM americana) e escrutínio pesado de Wall Street.   “Não fiquei nem um pouco nervoso quando o bitcoin caiu para US$ 16 mil. Não precisava vender. Quem comprou ações da minha empresa talvez tenha ficado.”  Dois anos depois de se afastar do dia a dia, Saylor reconhece que “deu a volta por cima” e a empresa, que no início da pandemia quase se inviabilizou, vale agora US$ 25 bilhões e soma US$ 15 bilhões em bitcoin na tesouraria. Neste ano, enquanto o bitcoin subiu 53%, as ações da MicroStrategy saltaram 135% — em um ano, o placar sobe para 112% a 343%.    Antes mesmo da aprovação em janeiro dos fundos negociados em bolsa (ETFs) de bitcoin à vista nos EUA, que trouxe investidores das finanças tradicionais para o segmento, a MicroStrategy foi vista como uma “opção regulada” para gestores de ações ganharem exposição ao bitcoin. Comprar ações da empresa se tornou uma opção “alavancada” de aplicar na criptomoeda.   O empresário fez uma viagem “secreta” ao Brasil, onde se reuniu com o presidente do Banco Central, Roberto Campos Neto. Entusiastas cripto brasileiros disputaram uma cadeira nos eventos em que participou. Ele falou com o Valor na sede da BLP Crypto, uma das anfitriãs e mais antiga das gestoras de investimento em criptomoedas, acompanhado de quatro seguranças, com a exigência de que a conversa só fosse publicada após deixar o país. A seguir trechos da entrevista:   Valor: Como o Brasil desponta no mundo cripto?   Michael Saylor: Essa é a minha primeira viagem de negócios ao Brasil. Sou um defensor e evangelista do bitcoin e fiquei entusiasmado por conhecer vários líderes brasileiros e ouvir deles sobre a adoção de ativos digitais. O Brasil tem sido muito inovador. A adoção de ativos digitais pelos bancos brasileiros tem sido, creio eu, uma das mais entusiasmadas e sofisticadas do mundo. Estamos no meio de uma grande transformação digital das finanças, a digitalização do capital e da propriedade. Só que isso tem trazido muita ansiedade e confusão.   Valor: Quais perguntas mais tem ouvido aqui e em outros lugares?   Saylor: Há muita angústia porque as pessoas não sabem classificar todas essas coisas. Qual é a diferença entre uma moeda digital e uma propriedade digital? E o que é energia, capital digital e token? E qual é o caso de uso? Para que servem? Tenho que trocar meu real por dólar, depois por bitcoin? São questões que geram uma ansiedade desnecessária. Uma das coisas mais úteis que podemos fazer é apenas concordar com a taxonomia para que possamos avançar e fazer progressos. Criptoativos implicam fazer muitas coisas de forma muito rápida, que as pessoas não entendem muito bem.   Valor: Qual a fonte dessa ansiedade e confusão?   Saylor: O equívoco ou confusão número um no momento é se a moeda digital, no caso bitcoin, é uma propriedade digital ou um meio de troca. A maior parte da incerteza regulatória surge daí. Se as pessoas entendessem o bitcoin como uma propriedade digital, que é uma reserva de valor — e não um meio de troca —, a maioria das preocupações e dúvidas simplesmente desaparecem. Você não vai usar bitcoin para comprar café.   Valor: Em 2013, o sr. disse que o bitcoin estava com os dias contados. Agora é um evangelista cripto. Como mudou sua cabeça?   Saylor: Naquela época não precisava dele. Os primeiros defensores do bitcoin foram argentinos porque a cada 20 anos todo mundo perde tudo por causa da inflação. As pessoas, normalmente, começam negando o bitcoin — ‘não acredito que funcione, é tulipa’. Depois passam a ter uma visão cética — ‘é muito bom para ser verdade; o governo não vai deixar’. Em 2020, a pandemia virou o mundo de cabeça para baixo e o bitcoin estava começando a se destacar. Naquele ponto, deixei de ser negacionista para cético.   Valor: Como um cético passa a defender o bitcoin?   Saylor: Fundei a MicroStrategy dois anos após sair do MIT. Criei vários outros negócios, investi em tecnologia. Alguns foram bem, outros não deram certo. Comecei a investir meu próprio capital em empresas como Apple, Amazon, Facebook e Google, que são negócios de trilhões de dólares e poderosas redes digitais. Aprendi com isso que se você conseguir “desmaterializar” algo que um bilhão de pessoas desejam, será um bom negócio.   Valor: Como assim, “desmaterializar”? Seria transformar em digital algo analógico?   Saylor: O Google desmaterializou livros, bibliotecas e informações. O Facebook desmaterializou relações humanas, comunicações e também as suas fotos. A Apple desmaterializou todos os dispositivos da sua mesa em um único iPhone. Esse é o poder da transformação digital. Também percebi que a chave para fazer um investimento bem-sucedido é investir em uma rede digital que todos no mundo precisam, que ninguém no mundo possa parar e na qual a maioria das pessoas discorde de você; então, você fará muito dinheiro.   Valor: Precisa estar na contramão?   Saylor: Em 2010, se você perguntasse às pessoas: o que você acha da Amazon? A maioria dos investidores teria dito que é algo que não dá dinheiro, que era uma ideia estúpida. A Amazon foi essa ideia, de uma loja digital, que vende a partir do seu telefone ou do computador, e esmagou todo mundo. E foi imparável. Em 2020 todos perceberam isso. Mas em 2010, a maioria das pessoas teria discordado.   Valor: E o sucesso do bitcoin?   Saylor: 2020 foi o ano em que a MicroStrategy se envolveu com bitcoin. Uma rede digital dominante que possa satisfazer uma necessidade humana fundamental para um bilhão de pessoas custa US$ 1 trilhão de dólares, talvez mais. Quando a covid chegou o mundo bifurcou-se e vou chamar isso de “Main Street” e “Wall Street”. As empresas da Main Street, como restaurantes, academias de ginástica, estúdios de ioga, empresas de cruzeiros, hotéis, todos eles físicos, foram todos encerrados… Foi o pior ano da vida deles em 30 anos. Muitos deles faliram. Por outro lado, as gestoras de Wall Street que detinham grandes ações de tecnologia tiveram o melhor ano porque todas essas ações subiram. Amazon disparou, Apple disparou…   Valor: Essa é a divisão entre o mundo analógico e digital?   Saylor: Quando as taxas de juros chegaram a zero ou perto de zero, o valor de um edifício dobrou da noite para o dia. Se você tinha imóveis, ações e títulos de renda fixa, quando a taxa de juros cai de 3% para 0%, o valor dispara 20% ou 30%. Então, vi uma coisa bizarra: um grupo de pessoas tendo o melhor ano de suas vidas sem fazer nada. E outro grupo trabalhando duro como nunca, sem chegar a lugar nenhum, tendo o pior ano de suas vidas.   Valor: Em que lado a MicroStrategy estava?   Saylor: Aconteceu que minha empresa estava nesta situação interessante: eu tinha US$ 600 milhões em caixa, tinha 2.000 pessoas gerando US$ 500 milhões por ano em receitas, crescendo de zero a 5% ao ano. E Wall Street avaliava isso em US$ 600 milhões. Bem, quando as taxas de juros chegaram a zero, o rendimento do dinheiro vai a zero. A expectativa era que, para os próximos quatro anos, o caixa geraria zero. Os manuais de finanças corporativas dizem que se você não vai conseguir um retorno de 10% ou 20% sobre o seu capital, que é o que dava o S&P 500, o melhor a fazer é devolvê-lo. Basta comprar as ações de volta ou distribuir o dinheiro. A alternativa seria investir, fazer aquisições. Chegamos ao ponto em que tínhamos que escolher entre uma morte rápida, uma morte lenta ou arriscar. A morte rápida é devolvemos o capital aos acionistas. Na minha carreira empresarial, observei que 99% dos meus concorrentes faliram porque fizeram aquisições diluidoras que nunca funcionaram. E o problema é que todo mundo passou a trabalhar remotamente. E então Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple e Microsoft queria contratar todos os nossos funcionários, pagando-lhes 20% a mais ou dando-lhes opções de ações, que valem alguma coisa. E nossas opções de ações não valem nada se nossas ações não subirem _a única maneira de fazer com que suas ações subam é crescer mais rápido do que a taxa de expansão monetária, o que significa que você precisa crescer de 10% a 20% ao ano de forma consistente. Percebemos que tudo que mantinha nossos funcionários fiéis tinha desaparecido.   Valor: Sem funcionários não tem empresa…   Saylor: Pensamos e pensamos: Existe uma maneira de nos tornarmos uma empresa financeira? Começamos a pensar no que poderíamos comprar. E há muitos motivos técnicos pelos quais você não pode comprar um monte de valores mobiliários. Não fazia mais sentido comprar ações da Amazon ou da Apple. Você não pode comprar um prédio, que estavam supervalorizados naquela época e estavam vazios. Então comecei a pensar que talvez devesse comprar uma reserva de valor não soberana. Isso é ouro. De repente, redescobri o ouro e comecei a estudá-lo. Mas então eu percebi que o problema com o ouro é que a oferta dobra a cada 30 anos porque continuam produzindo mais ouro.   Valor: Qual seria a alternativa? Ouro digital?   Saylor: Comecei a pensar: E se eu pudesse criar algo que parecesse ouro, mas não tivesse nenhum dos problemas do ouro? De outra forma pensei: e se o ouro fosse absolutamente escasso. Mas e se o Facebook fosse o dinheiro?

    "description": "The Salesforce CEO has big shoes to fill.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-15T20:45:42Z",
    "content": "For decades, devotees of investing icon Warren Buffett could bid in an annual auction to win a lunch with the Oracle of Omaha, and over the years, proceeds from the philanthropic sales raised $53 million for Glide, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that aids those suffering from homelessness, poverty and substance abuse. Now, two years after Buffett hosted his final lunch, the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) head is passing the torch to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. \n\t\t\t\t\tThank you for signing up!\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\tBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a rel=\"nofollow noreferer\" href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime.\t\t\t\t “The baton is in the right hands with Marc Benioff. He’s going to do a wonderful job improving on what I did over the years,” said Buffett in a statement. “With Marc’s enthusiasm and commitment, along with Glide’s leadership and volunteers, Glide will able to continue providing its vital services for San Francisco,” added Buffett, who personally asked Benioff to get involved in the auction. Open for bidding between May 5 and May 10, the online auction hosted by eBay will kick off with a $25,000 starting price. As usual, all proceeds will benefit Glide’s services and programs and the winner can bring up to seven guests to the meal. “We are so grateful that Marc Benioff is continuing Warren Buffett’s legacy of supporting San Francisco’s most vulnerable,” said Gina Fromer, Glide president and CEO, in a statement. Benioff has big shoes to fill. Debuting in 2000 with a $25,000 winning bid from tech entrepreneur Pete Budlong, the annual charity lunch auction has reliably raised at least $1 million since 2008. After a two-year hiatus in 2020 and 2021 amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the auction raised a record-breaking $19 million in 2022 for Buffett’s final charity lunch.  While it hasn't yet been determined where Benioff will be hosting his lunch, Buffett's typically occurred at Manhattan's Smith & Wollensky steakhouse. A medium-rare steak with hash browns and a cherry coke was reportedly the Berkshire Hathaway CEO's usual order. While most auction winners glean wisdom and advice from the seasoned investor, some past lunches have led to job opportunities. Ted Weschler, a hedge fund manager who spent two lunches with Buffett in 2010 and 2011 for a total of $5.2 million, evidently impressed the billionaire during those meals and now works as an investment manager for Berkshire Hathaway. Although restricted from discussing Buffett's future investment plans, it's not unusual for lunch-goers to use their time with the investor to talk business. Justin Sun, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur who placed a winning bid of $4.6 million in 2019, attempted to convince Buffett—an outspoken critic of digital currency—of the potential of Bitcoin during his meal. In 2009, auction winner Zhao Danyang received an accidental windfall when he told the media ahead of his lunch that he planned to give Buffett a stock tip for the Chinese retailer WuMart. Shares soared in anticipation, with Danyang's stocks in the company increasing in value by $16 million. Buffett's annual lunches were initially conceived by his late wife Susan, who died in 2004 and was involved with Glide. The Berkshire Hathaway head has long been involved in philanthropy and has pledged to give away most of his $132.6 billion fortune. Alongside Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates, he helped establish the Giving Pledge, a campaign that urges billionaires to donate the majority of their wealth to charity. Benioff, who has a net worth of $9.7 billion, is a signee of the campaign and has funneled his philanthropy towards organizations working in health care and income inequality. His recent donations have been largely focused on Hawaii, where the Salesforce executive owns large swathes of land, and have included $150 million gift benefitting hospitals and the transfer of 282 acres to a nonprofit focused on affordable housing. \"I'm incredibly humbled to continue Warren's legacy by supporting the Power of One Charity Lunch Auction, and I'm so grateful for the passion of Susie and the leadership of Warren and Reverend Cecil Williams,\" said Benioff in a statement. \"We're thrilled to work with Glide, building on their great work to support the amazing city of San Francisco.\" We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

The auction was held by Goldin, a collectibles marketplace, with the winning bid coming in at $17,000 plus a buyer's premium of $3,740. The auction ended on Saturday. Goldin said the autograph of Berkshire Hathaway's CEO was the most bid on item in its March Pop Culture Elite Auction, receiving a total of 51 bids.  The description of the item reads: \"Presented is an uncut $1 bill sheet signed by American businessman Warren Buffett. Buffett has penned his following signature in black market across the face of the sheet. The sheet comes with an LOA from JSA for signature.\"  The uncut sheet of dollar bills includes eight Series 1995 dollar bills, with a \"K\" letter marking indicating that the dollar bills originated from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. This isn't the first time Warren Buffett's signature on US currency has hit the auction block. In 2015, a $100 bill signed by Buffett sold for $1,477. Buffett's popularity has never been higher. The 93-year-old investor is the 10th richest person in the world with a fortune worth $133 billion. Nearly all of Buffett's fortune is derived from his 37.9% ownership stake in Berkshire Hathaway Class A stock, which currently trades for just over $609,000 per share.  \n                              Read next\n                             Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to"

    "content": "Fund next-gen business journalism with $10 a month Search Free Newsletters Berkshire Hathaway, the holdings company founded and led by renowned investor Warren Buffett, bought 1.9 million shares  Liberty Sirius XM last week for nearly $50 million, according to filings with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Berkshire has bought shares of the tracking stock every trading session since March, Barron’s reports.  A tracking stock is a type of equity offered by a parent company that tracks the performance of a specific division. In this case Liberty Media, which owns about 83% of Sirius XM, offers a tracking stock of Sirius XM. The satellite radio company Sirius XM Holdings operates Sirius XM and the online radio service Pandora and sells its own stock under the ticker symbol SIRI.  Berkshire now owns more than a 21% stake in Liberty Media Sirius XM, which was worth about $2.6 billion on Friday. The stock is currently down 13%, to about $25.30, since the start of the year. Sirius XM Holdings is down 40% to $3.20.  It seems like Buffett is attempting to capitalize on the looming combination of the two stocks. In December, Liberty Media, which also owns Formula 1 and LiveNation, announced that it had reached a definitive agreement deal with Sirius XM Holdings to combine their stocks and create a new public company called “New Sirius XM.” The new company would continue to operate under the Sirius XM brand. “We have reached an important milestone in Liberty’s ownership of SiriusXM,” said Liberty President & CEO Greg Maffei in a press release at the time. “This combination will create value for all stockholders by eliminating the tracking stock structure, enhancing liquidity and allowing former LSXM stockholders to participate directly in the ongoing performance of SiriusXM.” The deal will grant holders of Liberty Sirius XM 8.4 shares of Sirius XM for every share they own of the tracking stock, according to Barron’s.

What is professional liability insurance coverage? What does professional liability insurance cover? And what does professional liability insurance cost? Before you purchase a policy, you’ll want answers to these questions. This guide provides information to help you understand the concept of professional liability insurance, why it is important, and more.    What is Professional Liability Insurance? Professional liability insurance protects individuals or businesses that provide professional advice. In this context, “professional” refers to people like accountants, lawyers, and others who have specialized knowledge and training in a particular area and are expected to meet specific standards. \"Liability\" means being responsible—typically by law—for the consequences of your actions. So, professional liability coverage is designed to protect people who provide expert advice or services and are sued by clients over something that caused the client a financial loss—whether the policyholder did what they are accused of or not. What Does Professional Liability Insurance Cover? We're often asked, \"What does professional liability insurance cover?\" Professional liability insurance, also called errors and omissions insurance or simply E&O, provides coverage for three main types of claims: As you can see, it makes sense to have a good level of professional liability coverage. Of course, the causes of a professional liability lawsuit may differ, but the result is the same: If a court finds you liable, your business can be required to compensate a client financially. If you don’t have professional liability insurance, your company must pay that compensation directly. The cost of a single incident can produce a significant financial burden for an uninsured or inadequately insured company. Unfortunately, that expense can be so large that it drives the organization out of business. That’s why having professional liability insurance is vital. What Isn’t Covered by Professional Liability Insurance? Professional liability insurance provides critical financial protection and covers many types of errors and omissions, whether actual or alleged. However, like any type of small business insurance, a professional insurance liability policy has exclusions. For example, it won’t protect your business if you commit fraud or other criminal acts. A professional insurance liability policy also won’t cover things that aren’t crimes but are intentional actions or intentional delays in performing required activities. In other words, professional liability insurance is designed to help protect you when you’ve made honest mistakes. Coverage is also limited to your professional advice or services. Other policies cover different types of incidents. For example: A licensed biBERK insurance expert can talk with you about your business and help you understand which parts of your operation professional liability insurance can and cannot cover. For example, common questions that get asked are, “What is professional liability insurance?”, \"What is the difference between general liability and professional liability?\",  and “What does professional liability insurance cost?” Who Needs Professional Liability Insurance? In general, anyone who provides professional advice or services may need professional liability insurance. That broad description covers many specific business specialties and roles, including: These are just examples. If you don’t see your type of business on this list, that doesn’t mean you wouldn’t benefit from professional liability insurance. You should contact a biBERK representative to talk about your company and your business insurance needs. If you assume you don’t need a policy when, in fact, you do need it, you can end up with a considerable out-of-pocket legal expense. Am I Required to Have Professional Liability Insurance? States dictate whether certain professions are required to have professional liability insurance and/or disclose whether they carry coverage. Consequently, you’ll need to get familiar with the regulations for your industry and location. biBERK licensed insurance experts can provide guidance. Beyond state requirements, your clients may require you to have professional liability insurance. Often, contracts will include clauses regarding insurance coverage. Professional Liability Insurance, Legal Defense Costs, and Punitive Damages If a client sues you over a covered professional liability issue, your biBERK professional liability policy can pay for your legal defense. It can also cover any damages (including punitive damages, if permitted by law in your state) the court awards to the plaintiff. In addition, we provide an attorney to represent you, which can help relieve some of the anxiety in a very stressful situation. Our covering of punitive damages is vital since the dollar figures can be quite high. Courts assess punitive damages on top of other damages to punish companies they find to be at fault. If your state allows these damages to be covered by a professional liability insurance policy, biBERK can cover you up to the policy limit. What Does Professional Liability Insurance Cost? Many people are concerned about the money they’ll need for this type of coverage and often ask “What does professional liability insurance cost?” Professional liability insurance costs are very reasonable when you consider the protection provided. biBERK professional liability policies start at around $300 per year and go up from there. Your cost is calculated based on several factors, including your industry, the level of coverage you choose, your years in business, number of employees, revenue, and the policy limits you need. You can get an instant, self-service online quote to learn what you’ll pay for this vital coverage. But, if you have additional questions about how much professional liability insurance costs or need help purchasing coverage, a biBERK representative is happy to assist you. How Can I Keep My Professional Liability Insurance Cost Down? biBERK’s professional liability insurance policies are among the most affordable on the market. Our direct-to-you approach means we cut out brokers and middlemen to offer you coverage at up to 20% less than other companies. Still, there are a few steps you can take to ensure you’re getting great insurance at the lowest price. For starters, you should purchase the right amount of coverage. The more financial protection you want, the higher your premiums will be. For example, all else being equal, $500,000 in coverage will cost less than $2 million in coverage. You can also select a higher deductible. As with auto insurance, higher deductibles mean lower premiums. However, you must have that deductible amount available at all times in the event of a claim. Ultimately, it’s about finding the right balance between your needs and your budget. In addition, you can keep your professional liability costs down by having a Statement of Work, contract, or other document executed by you and your client that clearly spells out expectations, timelines, etc. That way, there’s no confusion about what the project or relationship entails and less risk of a lawsuit. If you can have an attorney review the agreement, that’s even better. Understanding Professional Liability Insurance Retroactive Dates Professional liability insurance is somewhat unique in that it can have what’s called a retroactive date. This date means that your policy may cover costs associated with claims that clients file after your coverage is in force for issues that occurred before you bought your current policy. Here's an example: Your professional liability policy began on June 30, with a retroactive date of January 1. In mid-July, a former client claims you made a mistake in March when working on their tax return. Both you and the client were unaware of this issue when you bought your policy as it didn’t come to light until July. Since the occurrence causing the claim took place during the retroactive coverage period (between January 1 and June 29), and you made the claim during your regular coverage period, your policy will likely cover it.   When you buy your first professional liability policy, you don’t receive coverage for prior acts. However, you build this coverage over time as you continually purchase new coverage. The first policy only covers acts that both occurred and were reported during the first year. The second policy covers acts that occurred during the first two years and reported during the second year, and so on. Does biBERK Offer Professional Liability Insurance in My State? biBERK offers professional liability insurance in all U.S. states. If you have questions about whether you can purchase other types of small business insurance where you are, our coverage maps make it easy to check availability. Keep in mind that factors like your business type, claims history, and others affect our ability to offer you insurance coverage, even if it’s technically available in your state. How to Prove You Have Professional Liability Insurance A Certificate of Insurance (COI) is a physical or digital document that states you have purchased insurance and summarizes your coverage. Individuals and organizations with which you have a business relationship may ask you to provide them with COIs. They do this because the fact that you have insurance lowers their risk should a lawsuit related to your professional services occur. You can obtain these documents easily and at no cost on the biBERK website. If you need to add what’s called an additional insured (meaning someone, like a client, who may be covered by your policy), our representatives can help you with that. An Example of Professional Liability Insurance in Action How does professional liability insurance work? Imagine you’re an architect, and you design a bridge for a local municipality. A construction company builds the bridge according to your blueprints, and initially, it looks fine. However, after a few months, parts of the bridge show signs of deterioration. Then, before the city can do anything, a section of the bridge collapses. Fortunately, no one is hurt, but a subsequent review of your blueprints shows that an error you made in your calculations caused the bridge to fail. The city sues your firm for several expenses incurred due to your faulty design. These costs include commissioning a new design, paying to have the bridge rebuilt, etc. And this is a very simplified scenario, of course. Professional liability litigation frequently involves multiple parties, contractors and subcontractors, suits and countersuits, etc. Needless to say, the cost of an honest mistake can be very high. The good news is that if you have a sufficient amount of professional liability insurance, your policy may protect you from the financial repercussions of this type of event. Simply report the claim, and our team will contact you and go to work on your behalf. Even if no one ever sues you, simply knowing that biBERK has your back can lower your stress level and enable you to do your job confidently and without continually second-guessing your work. Frequently Asked Questions About Professional Liability Insurance Who needs professional liability insurance? What is professional liability insurance and who needs it? Professionals who work in certain sectors or industries should get a comprehensive professional liability insurance policy as a matter of course. It’s a core business requirement for some professions—particularly those people who might be more likely to have service-based disputes. It’s a priority if your business provides any form of professional services, such as advice and consultancy, to clients. It’s also a must-have if you’re in a line of work that means you’re more open to disputes over quality of work or copyright (if you’re a designer, for instance). You should consider a professional liability policy if you’re more at risk of being sued for professional negligence, including if you’re a freelance worker or provide any services on a self-employed basis. People who work in sectors such as healthcare are also likely to need professional indemnity insurance (like medical malpractice insurance) because they work with specific industry bodies that set rules and regulations that must be adhered to. Basically, if there’s a chance a client could take you to court over a professional advice or services dispute that has adversely affected them, then taking out a professional liability coverage policy is a good idea. If you’re still not sure whether you need one, talk with one of our licensed insurance experts. They can give you accurate advice on what you need (and what you don’t need). How much professional liability insurance do I need? It sounds a little vague, but you should take out as much as you can afford, once you’ve spoken to an insurance advisor and worked out what you might need. This type of insurance policy isn’t a one-size-fits-all type of coverage. Every business and every worker is different, so their needs for insurance will also be unique. Consequently, it’s difficult to predict how much professional liability insurance cover anyone will need. You should start by thinking about the following: What do you do? Who do you do it for? What are your services worth? If you can provide us with detailed answers to these questions, it can help us advise you on how much coverage you need and what it will cost. Is professional liability insurance required? It very much depends on the type of services you or your business offer, and it’s worth talking to a biBERK professional insurance advisor if you’re not sure. Check your state laws, rules, and regulations, and get advice from one of our experts. How does professional liability insurance work? Professional liability insurance helps protect you against claims for loss or damage made by clients in the event you’ve given incorrect advice or provided a service to them that fails to meet accepted standards. Your policy can pay for court-awarded damages and your legal defense expenses. What does professional liability insurance not cover? Professional liability insurance policies often have exclusions and it’s worth knowing what these are before you take a policy out. For instance, if your business has committed fraud or any other form of criminal activity, professional liability insurance won’t cover you. It also won’t cover intentional actions or intentional delays in performing required activities or services for a client. So, to put it in its simplest terms, professional liability insurance will only protect you when you’ve made honest errors and mistakes. Getting and Managing a Professional Liability Insurance Policy is Easy Professional liability insurance can protect your business in the face of complicated legal actions, but getting the coverage is simple. You can get a quote and purchase a policy online whenever it’s convenient. You can also manage your policy on our website, and if you ever have to report a claim, you can do that online, as well. Once your policy is in force, you can rest easy knowing you have the financial strength of biBERK and the Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Group behind you.

He founded his fresh-pasta company in 1962 and remains the face of the family business -- which now operates in 38 countries and is worth nearly $700 million. FASHION HAS A bumper crop of octo- and nonagenarians, with seminal figures like Ralph Lauren (84) still fully biting and Valentino Garavani (91) still verifiably kicking. But between them stands Armani, who remains the sole shareholder of his Milan company (an increasing rarity among iconic luxury brands) and continues to put trend-changing creations onto catwalks each year. APPOINTED BY QUEEN Elizabeth II in 1991, he was Belize’s longest-serving governor-general when he retired in 2021 at age 89. Since then, he’s reportedly continued his efforts to improve music education in the Central-American commonwealth (he helped establish the Belize Academy of the Performing Arts in 2019).  AFTER SERVING AS PM from 2004 to 2014, Singh maintained his seat on the Indian government’s upper parliament for another decade — hitting age 91 before deciding to retire in April 2024. HIS 2024 OSCAR nomination for the Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny soundtrack was his 17th nomination since 2000 (and 49th total, the standing record). Yet the guy behind the music for Jaws, every Indiana Jones movie and every Star Warsfilm has only won once (for a certain 1977 space flick)…at least so far. He’s probably penning a score in Universal studio office right now. WHENEVER THE \"ORACLE of Omaha” utters an opinion or makes a portfolio move, investors across the planet snap to attention (and often follow his lead). A billionaire since the 1980s, his advice for investors large and small is pretty simple: think long term and stick with low-cost index funds.  CLINT'S LATEST DIRECTORIAL effort, Juror #2, should hit theaters in the fall of 2024. He’s calling it his final film (on either side of the screen), but don’t bet on it. Remember when Gran Torino opened with all that “swan song” talk in 2008? No? Well, he’s put out another dozen movies since then — including one nominated for Best Picture at the 2016 Oscars (American Sniper). THE AUSSIE BILLIONAIRE may have “officially” turned over the reigns of his empire (which includes Fox News and the Wall Street Journal, among many other print and digital entities) to his two sons in late 2023, but make no mistake — industry insiders say his perch as “Chairman Emeritus” keeps him in charge.  REALLY, WHO HAS a bad word to say about him? He’s still the chair of the New York investment firm he founded in 1970, still growing his global charitable organizations, and still a game-changing political donor…which should keep him in the center of countless conspiracy theories for years to come. THE UNMISTAKABLE VOICE behind seven decades of loping leopards and fornicating tree frogs is still pumping out nature documentaries. He’s also a persuasive force in England’s political circles, often lending his weight to fighting climate change. AFTER SERVING AS PM for two decades (1981 to 2003), he ascended to the post again from 2018 to 2020 — heading the country until age 94. He remains an outspoken voice in Malaysian politics after more than 60 years in government. This is just the beginning. See what else guys at 50+ are thinking, doing, and crushing here.

    "description": "\"I think maybe a little bit like Warren Buffett or Queen Elizabeth II, I'm just going to keep prodding on because I feel as though I'm able to do my best work,\" she told People.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-15T05:44:40Z",
    "content": "       Vera Wang says she won't stop working even as she grows older. \"I think maybe a little bit like Warren Buffett or Queen Elizabeth II, I'm just going to keep prodding on because I feel as though I'm able to do my best work more and more,\" Wang, who's turning 75 in June, told People. The fashion designer, who started her business at 40, said she still enjoyed being creative. \"I'm really trying to respect that in me, that voice in me, that I feel very happy to be creating. That's what it's all about, really,\" Wang said. After working as a Vogue editor and an accessories designer at Ralph Lauren, Wang opened a bridal boutique in 1990 at the Carlyle Hotel in New York City. Since then, her namesake brand has expanded to include fragrances, jewelry, and homeware. In May 2021, Wang told CNBC that her work had allowed her \"to really have a very full life.\" \"I think work has been my whole life, and it's kept me honestly relevant, fascinated, passionate, frightened, worried and stressed,\" she said. \"I think the day that I don't want to grow will really be the day that I stop.\" Wang is part of a list of celebrities and CEOs who have been vocal about their decisions to continue working even as they get older. Jay Leno, 73, told Page Six in May last year that he wouldn't stop working \"unless I have a stroke.\" Clint Eastwood told The Independent in April 2013 that he wanted to continue making films for as long as possible. \n                              Related stories\n                             \"That's always everybody's dream. Wouldn't it be great to be 105 and still making films?\" he said. Eastwood turned 93 in May 2023. His last project was \"Cry Macho\" in 2021, which he directed and starred in, according to his IMDB page. Warren Buffett, who turned 93 in August, is the oldest CEO of a Fortune 500 company. During a 2015 Fortune summit, the billionaire investor said it would be \"crazy\" for him to leave his job because he still loved it. \"I'm tap dancing to work every day. There's nothing more exciting than to get there. It doesn't get better than that,\" Buffett said. In May last year, Ron Olson, a Berkshire Hathaway board member, told investors that he didn't think Greg Abel would take over as CEO of the company anytime soon, the Associated Press reported. \"Warren is the same way. His energy is amazing. So don't count on Greg taking over tomorrow,\" Olson said. About one in five Americans over 65 were employed in 2023, a Pew Research Center analysis found. This is almost a twofold increase compared with 35 years ago. In a different Pew Research Center survey from 2023, workers who were 65 and older were also more likely to say they were satisfied with their jobs compared with younger workers. In 2019, about one-third of Americans over 40 who participated in a TD Ameritrade survey said they'd continue working even if they had no financial need. Some of the top reasons included keeping their mind sharp and avoiding boredom. I. Roy Cohen, a 101-year-old former CEO, previously told Business Insider's Jane Ridley that he continued working until he was 81. \"The idea of early retirement is horrible to me,\" he said. \"It's stultifying.\" He also said keeping busy with home-improvement projects and even keeping track of his own finances had helped his mind stay agile. \n                              Today's top stories\n                             Jump to"

    "title": "7 Top Vanguard ETFs To Buy For Retirement Investing",
    "description": "Vanguard ETFs are a popular choice among investors, but the number of exchange-traded funds can be overwhelming. This article picks the top ones for retirement.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-16T21:43:24Z",
    "content": "© 2023 Bloomberg Finance LP Vanguard facilitates retirement saving for millions of U.S. households. The asset manager's collection of low-cost funds can tackle any retirement goal, from capital appreciation to income. Vanguard exchange-traded funds are particularly interesting because they have no minimum investment. Savers can buy one share or 20, depending on their budget and timeline. Read on for a closer look at seven Vanguard ETFs for retirement savers. The list includes options suitable for kicking off a retirement savings effort as well as funds that can carry the ball over the goal line. Investors like Vanguard ETFs because they have low fees, understandable strategies and a wide range of choices. Low fees are especially important for retirement investors because their portfolios stay active for so long. Over 40 or 50 years, the difference between an expense ratio of 0.03% and 0.05% can add up to tens of thousands of dollars. Another interesting aspect of Vanguard as a company is its ownership structure. Vanguard is owned by its funds. Those who invest in Vanguard funds, then, indirectly become owners. That structure ensures the company is aligned to the needs and goals of Vanguard fund shareholders. This collection of Vanguard ETFs is constructed on the premise that retirement investors' needs change over time. Young investors in their 20s and 30s, for example, can accept higher risk and volatility in the pursuit of capital appreciation. These savers won't access their retirement capital for decades, which means current volatility isn't much of an issue. They're likely to come out ahead by holding through market downturns and waiting for the recoveries that inevitably follow. Retirement investors in the middle of their careers should start building some defense into their strategy. A greater emphasis on income-producing assets can help run interference against market volatility going forward. As the investor's career winds down, capital preservation becomes the priority. Aggressive equities are less suitable in this phase. Increased exposure to low-volatility stocks and bonds can provide a good balance of upside and stability. The Vanguard ETFs noted here cover those tactics. There are options for strong growth, moderate growth, income and diversification. As well, they're all passively managed index funds with expense ratios of 0.07% or less. The brain trust at Forbes has run the numbers, conducted the research, and done the analysis to come up with some of the best places for you to make money in 2024. Download Forbes' most popular report, 12 Stocks To Buy Now. The table below highlights seven Vanguard ETFs recommended for different types of retirement investors.   Vanguard Growth ETF invests in about 200 large-cap U.S. growth stocks like Microsoft\nMSFT\n , Apple\nAAPL\n , Nvidia and Amazon\nAMZN\n. VUG makes this list of top ETFs because it provides convenient access to the largest growth stocks in the U.S. These have solid appreciation potential plus the size and scale to manage through economic downturns. The portfolio may show some volatility in the near-term, which is why it's best suited for young or risk-tolerant retirement investors.   VXF invests in about 3,500 small- and mid-cap equities, including Palantir Technologies\nPLTR\n , Super Micro Computer\nSMCI\n and Coinbase (COIN). The portfolio represents most of the stock market excluding those stocks that are in the S&P 500. VXF provides exposure to up-and-coming companies that have steeper growth potential than mega stocks like Microsoft. One challenge with investing in small- and mid-caps is that they individually can be unpredictable and reactive. VXF addresses that issue through diversification. Because there are thousands of individual stocks in the portfolio, VXF investors can enjoy the exposure to these interesting smaller companies without being dependent on any one of them.   VIG holds 150 stocks that regularly raise their dividends, such as Broadcom\nAVGO\n (AVGO), JPMorgan (JPM), UnitedHealth Group\nUNH\n and Visa\nV\n . The fund's current 30-day SEC yield is 1.7%. A stream of ever-increasing dividend income from VIG can help offset the inflationary pressures that tighten every retiree's budget. Savers who like that idea might consider investing in VIG early. This fund won't grow as quickly as VUG, but reinvesting dividends for decades is an easy way to build a nice income machine to tap in retirement. Stop chasing shadows in the market. Forbes' expert analysts have pinpointed the 12 superstars poised to ignite returns in 2024. Don't miss out—download 12 Stocks To Buy Now and claim your front-row seat to the coming boom.   VOO owns all stocks in the S&P 500, including Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia and Amazon. There is overlap with the VUG portfolio, but VOO is more diversified. Between 1960 and 2023, the S&P 500 produced an inflation-adjusted compound annual growth rate of 6.3% including dividends. VOO provides easy, low-cost access to that performance. The fund is suitable as a core holding for retirement investors who can handle the normal fluctuations of the stock market.   MGV invests in very large public companies that appear to be undervalued. Top holdings include Berkshire Hathaway\nBRK.B\n (BRK.B), Home Depot (HD) and Procter & Gamble\nPG\n. Note that Berkshire Hathaway provides indirect exposure to its own value-oriented stock portfolio. For more information, see this article on top Warren Buffett stocks. Mega cap value stocks balance appreciation potential with lower volatility. They tend to have predictable business models that deliver slow-and-steady growth over time. Many are committed to returning value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Those qualities make the MGV portfolio a good pick for retirement savers with lower risk tolerance and shorter timelines.   VEU invests in more than 2,000 large-cap stocks from 46 developed and emerging markets outside the U.S. International exposure provides access to fast-growing markets around the world. It also reduces dependence on the U.S. financial markets, which cycle up and down. One analysis from Fidelity concludes that 30% international exposure in a long-term stock portfolio may contribute to lower overall volatility. This is because international stocks move on different cycles—they can rise when U.S. stocks are falling and vice versa. International stocks are generally riskier than domestic stocks, so this fund is better suited for younger investors with longer timelines.   The BND portfolio is a diversified basket of investment-grade, U.S. bonds. The fund does not hold inflation-protected or tax-exempt bonds. Fixed income funds play nicely alongside equity funds in a retirement portfolio. Stocks provide growth potential while bonds deliver stability and income. That's why most retirement portfolios should have some bond exposure. Younger retirement investors don't need as much stability or income, so they can hold BND in a smaller proportion—say, 10%. As retirement nears, investors can shift to higher bond allocations for lower overall volatility. The playbook for retirement investing involves early offense that shifts into strong defense. Vanguard has the straightforward, low-cost ETFs to quarterback both strategies, plus the transition in between. ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are pooled investment portfolios that trade on a stock exchange. You can buy and sell ETFs throughout the trading day, like a stock. Vanguard ETFs trade and reprice throughout the day, like stocks do. Mutual funds, on the other hand, aggregate all orders and settle them once daily. Investors like Vanguard ETFs because they have low expense ratios and they satisfy a wide range of practical investing themes, including large-cap value, dividend appreciation, diversified international equities and more. To invest in Vanguard ETFs, open a Vanguard account or place a trade order in your current IRA, Roth IRA or brokerage account. Investing with an IRA or Roth IRA has the advantage of deferring taxes on capital gains and income. You can buy and hold Vanguard ETFs within many traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs, including retirement accounts operated by Vanguard. Some Vanguard 401(k)s also have access to Vanguard ETFs, as would 401(k)s with brokerage windows. While each Vanguard fund has its own risk profile, all Vanguard index funds have low expense ratios. Choosing low-cost funds over higher-cost ones can add tens of thousands of dollars to the long-term investor's account balance over time.

    "description": "In a world that prizes knowledge and certainty, the wisest leaders are those who admit they don't have all the answers.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-16T13:34:45Z",
    "content": "A Socrates statue in front of Academy of Athens in Greece When Malcolm Gladwell questioned the business world’s reverence for Jack Welch’s leadership style at GE, he underlined a stark paradigm shift: the move from a culture of command and control to one of trust. We often equate good leadership with having all the answers. However, a profound transformation occurs when leaders shift their focus from providing solutions to fostering an environment of growth and learning. At its core, it is a shift away from focusing on oneself to focusing on others. Such a change not only builds a foundation of trust and psychological safety among teams, but also breeds innovation, adaptability, and resilience. Admitting ignorance doesn’t imply a lack of intelligence. In fact, it is a hallmark of wisdom. No one grasped this better than Socrates, the ancient Greek philosopher, as he constantly emphasized his own lack of knowledge. His celebrated student Plato quoted him as saying, “I am wiser than that man. Neither of us probably knows anything worthwhile; but he thinks he does when he does not, and I do not and do not think I do.” Socrates’ humble, inquisitive mindset has been honored through the “Socratic method” of teaching by asking questions rather than lecturing or dictating. Today, leaders are often coached to adopt a Socratic approach, with the aim of cultivating an atmosphere of curiosity, exploration, and openness to the limits of one’s knowledge. But to establish a deeply ingrained culture of inquisitiveness and collaboration, leaders must first remove the barrier of ego. They need to overcome the idea that “not knowing” makes them look unintelligent. Once leaders embrace a stance of openness and humility, the benefits are manifold. New perspectives. Charlie Munger, the late billionaire vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, modeled an open mindset throughout his investing career. As Jason Zweig wrote, Munger “possessed what philosophers call epistemic humility: a profound sense of how little anyone can know and how important it is to open and change your mind.” Munger regularly challenged and killed his best ideas by questioning his assumptions and conclusions. He approached every conversation with an eagerness to learn from others, because he understood that no one has a monopoly on wisdom. “Knowing what you don’t know is more useful than being brilliant,” Munger told Zweig. Executives can take a page from Munger’s book by viewing every interaction as an opportunity to learn, thereby uncovering valuable insights from unlikely sources and enriching both personal and organizational knowledge. Better problem solving. Elon Musk, the visionary behind Tesla and SpaceX, once advised, “Don't attach yourself to a person, place, or organization. Attach yourself to a mission, a calling, or a purpose.” By remaining laser focused on a greater purpose, but open to the where, who, and how, leaders allow novel ideas to surface. Musk understands that solving some of the world’s most challenging problems means not having all the answers upfront. “I think it’s very important to have a feedback loop, where you’re constantly thinking about what you’ve done and how you could be doing it better,” Musk said. “I think that’s the single best piece of advice—constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself.” This ethos enables Musk to relentlessly test, learn, iterate, and scale disruptive pursuits in areas like electric vehicles and space exploration. Whether studying history’s brightest intellectuals or today’s most famous business leaders, one pattern holds: True wisdom and great achievements emerge from a passionate quest to keep exploring, adapting, and evolving. By shedding ego and pride, leaders open themselves to discovering new solutions to old problems. They become more receptive to other viewpoints that can improve their initial perspectives. They more readily admit flaws in their existing strategies and correct course as needed, leading to remarkable results. As executives navigate a business environment disrupted by generative AI, geopolitical uncertainty, and more, embracing the power of not knowing may well be the most intelligent decision they can make.

    "description": "The pandemic, rather than crashing housing markets as initially feared, triggered a home price surge unlike any the country has seen, creating an unprecedented amount of wealth.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-16T12:00:09Z",
    "content": "Digital Replica Edition Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts  Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts Digital Replica Edition \n\t\t\tTrending:\t\t The pandemic, rather than crashing housing markets as initially feared, triggered a home price surge unlike any the country has seen, creating an unprecedented amount of wealth.Four years after the arrival of COVID-19, mountain resort communities continue to record the highest rates of home price appreciation in Colorado. At the same time, gains in some central Denver neighborhoods have failed to keep pace with inflation, according to a Denver Post analysis of home price changes in 401 Colorado ZIP codes provided by Zillow.Home price gains range from a nearly 107% gain in Edwards, an unincorporated area of Eagle County, to a 10.3% gain in downtown Denver. Smack dab in the middle, or at the median, was Hudson in Weld County with a 37.7% gain in home values over four years.“In that four-year period we had a once-in-a-lifetime swing in home prices. People wanted to get away from the pandemic in the major urban areas,” said Mike Budd, a broker with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Colorado Properties in Edwards.Houses dot the landscape at Colorado’s Steamboat Ski Resort, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022, in Steamboat Springs, Colo. (Thomas Peipert, The Associated Press)Allowed to go remote, some workers chose to leave densely populated cities for scenic rural areas. Colorado mountain communities with good broadband access became popular landing spots, Budd said. Some families who frequently visited Colorado decided to lock down vacation homes, aided by record-low interest rates.And then there were the uber-rich who viewed mountain properties as a better investment option than other alternatives. Budd said a “surprisingly” high percentage of home sales in resort areas in recent years have been all cash.Budd said the Vail Valley historically has about 800 listings at any given point, but the inventory dropped into the 100s during the most frenzied months. It has since bounced back to around 334 listings this year, but by any measure, supply remains tight.The typical home price is now approaching $1.8 million in Edwards, long considered a more affordable alternative to Vail or Beaver Creek to the east. And it wasn’t just a pandemic frenzy. In the past year, Edwards home prices rose another 7.7%, still near the top for appreciation.\n\nAlthough Edwards was the only Colorado area to double in value in four years, several mountain communities recorded home price appreciation rates above 70%. They include Snowmass, Snowmass Village, Steamboat Springs, Basalt, Telluride and Carbondale.Budd said the run-up has dramatically shifted the market. In the prior two decades, about two-thirds of transactions were under $1 million in the Vail Valley and only 4% were over $5 million. Today, only 28% of transactions are under $1 million, and 8% are over $5 million.Private land to build on is getting scarcer, construction costs remain significantly higher than along the Front Range, and water rights remain in short supply. That scarcity means mountain home prices probably aren’t heading back down as they did after the Great Recession.Central Denver left behindLast decade, a push toward urban living and being closer to work and in the center of the action benefitted downtown Denver and surrounding neighborhoods. But the pandemic changed all that when denser environments became associated with a higher risk of infection.Smaller living quarters, more common in core urban areas, became painfully cramped when work went remote. Less foot traffic from office workers hurt downtown retailers and restaurants. Public health closures temporarily removed big draws like theater performances and concerts. Protests in the summer of 2020 caused widespread property damage downtown. And the delayed rebuild of the 16th Street Mall continues to make a mess of things.A pedestrian talks on the phone while walking around construction on the 16th Street Mall in downtown Denver on Feb. 1, 2023. (Photo by Helen H. Richardson/The Denver Post)“In 2020 people started to work from home, and interest rates dropped and single-family homes became more affordable,” said Susan Chong, a principal with Iconique Real Estate, a brokerage firm specializing in urban properties. “Downtown has had one of the smaller gains in value.”Colorado’s three weakest-performing ZIP codes for home price appreciation in the past four years are in central Denver. They include 80202, with a gain of 10.3%; 80203 to the east with a 13.2% gain and 80218 with a 15.8% gain.Downtown is within 80202 and the neighborhoods covered by 80203 and 80218 include Speer, Uptown, Capitol Hill, Alamo Placita, City Park West, Cheesman Park and Country Club.The gains those areas saw might have been completely acceptable in earlier decades. But they didn’t keep pace with inflation and fell way behind the 37.7% median gain statewide.No Denver neighborhoods managed to surpass the statewide median, although 80249, an area of new construction near the airport, came closest with a 35.9% gain.In a real estate upswing of a lifetime, central Denver homeowners lost ground. The only other place in Colorado where that happened was in Rangely, a coal-dependent town that saw a gain of 16.6%.But there are signs that downtown real estate could be bottoming out as more sellers throw in the towel on trying to make the return they had hoped to make. In some cases, they have consigned themselves to taking a significant loss. Buyers, many from out-of-state, are there to meet them in their reluctant surrender to reality.“It has been quiet, but it is definitely making a comeback in the first quarter of this year,” Chong said. “People still believe in downtown.”Long-term, other trends could favor downtown areas. A survey from RCLCO, a real estate research firm, found that more affluent younger adults preferred to have second homes in downtown areas over mountain resorts, viewing them as a better long-term investment.“More people aged 35 to 44 preferred a city location,” said Caroline Flax Ganz, a real estate economist at RCLCO in Washington, D.C. As younger generations accumulate more wealth, they could gravitate towards downtown properties and bypass resort areas.They were looking at using downtown residences for weekend stays and viewed them as better investments in terms of rental income than mountain and beach areas, Ganz said on a press call Thursday.Surprising gains on the PlainsSummarizing the last four years as mountain resorts hot, dense urban areas not, and everywhere else somewhere in between, is an oversimplification.The Zillow data contained some surprises. After Edwards, the area closest to doubling its home values was Kit Carson in Cheyenne County with a 98.6% gain in the past four years.Las Animas in Bent County was up 73.5%, making the ninth spot out of 401 ZIP Codes tracked for pandemic price appreciation. McClave, in the same county, saw home prices up 70.4%, while Cheyenne Wells, about an hour south of Kit Carson, was up 67.1%.About half of the ZIP Codes on the Plains had too few transactions to allow Zillow to track them, especially in Colorado’s highly distressed southeastern corner. But when enough sales information was available, housing markets on the Eastern Plains outperformed those along the northern Front Range.And that outperformance has accelerated in the past year. Of the top five performing ZIP codes on a one-year basis, three were on the Plains, led by Kit Carson and Eads. Kirk in Yuma County has joined the home appreciation party in fifth place.The pursuit of affordability seems like the most reasonable explanation, and the Eastern Plains are starting from much lower price points. Even after almost doubling, the typical home price in Kit Carson only reached $141,592 in January, according to its Zillow Home Price Index.In Las Animas, typical homes were still going for $91,377, the only Colorado ZIP code in the study still below $100,000. That’s a far cry from Woody Creek outside Aspen, the state leader with a typical home value of just under $4.4 million. Boulder’s 80304 ZIP is the leader along the Front Range at $1.4 million.“We hear from a lot of people selling their homes on the Front Range trying to find a cheaper property,” said Brock Reedy, an associate broker with Wilson Realty in Lamar.In Lamar, Zillow pegs the typical home at $165,749, even after a 53.4% increase in the past four years. Brock adds that $200,000 can buy a nice home in Lamar with some land, while it won’t even “buy a bedroom” in downtown Denver.“We have had quite a few folks coming out from the Front Range,” said Virgil George, a managing broker at the Rocking X Land Co. in Burlington near the Kanas border.Heavy trucks roll by along Main Street on January 21, 2020 in Lamar, Colorado.

And the delayed rebuild of the 16th Street Mall continues to make a mess of things. “In 2020 people started to work from home, and interest rates dropped and single-family homes became more affordable,” said Susan Chong, a principal with Iconique Real Estate, a brokerage firm specializing in urban properties. “Downtown has had one of the smaller gains in value.” Colorado’s three weakest-performing ZIP codes for home price appreciation in the past four years are in central Denver. They include 80202, with a gain of 10.3%; 80203 to the east with a 13.2% gain and 80218 with a 15.8% gain. Downtown is within 80202 and the neighborhoods covered by 80203 and 80218 include Speer, Uptown, Capitol Hill, Alamo Placita, City Park West, Cheesman Park and Country Club. The gains those areas saw might have been completely acceptable in earlier decades. But they didn’t keep pace with inflation and fell way behind the 37.7% median gain statewide. No Denver neighborhoods managed to surpass the statewide median, although 80249, an area of new construction near the airport, came closest with a 35.9% gain. In a real estate upswing of a lifetime, central Denver homeowners lost ground. The only other place in Colorado where that happened was in Rangely, a coal-dependent town that saw a gain of 16.6%. But there are signs that downtown real estate could be bottoming out as more sellers throw in the towel on trying to make the return they had hoped to make. In some cases, they have consigned themselves to taking a significant loss. Buyers, many from out-of-state, are there to meet them in their reluctant surrender to reality. “It has been quiet, but it is definitely making a comeback in the first quarter of this year,” Chong said. “People still believe in downtown.” Long-term, other trends could favor downtown areas. A survey from RCLCO, a real estate research firm, found that more affluent younger adults preferred to have second homes in downtown areas over mountain resorts, viewing them as a better long-term investment. “More people aged 35 to 44 preferred a city location,” said Caroline Flax Ganz, a real estate economist at RCLCO in Washington, D.C. As younger generations accumulate more wealth, they could gravitate towards downtown properties and bypass resort areas. They were looking at using downtown residences for weekend stays and viewed them as better investments in terms of rental income than mountain and beach areas, Ganz said on a press call Thursday. Summarizing the last four years as mountain resorts hot, dense urban areas not, and everywhere else somewhere in between, is an oversimplification. The Zillow data contained some surprises. After Edwards, the area closest to doubling its home values was Kit Carson in Cheyenne County with a 98.6% gain in the past four years. Las Animas in Bent County was up 73.5%, making the ninth spot out of 401 ZIP Codes tracked for pandemic price appreciation. McClave, in the same county, saw home prices up 70.4%, while Cheyenne Wells, about an hour south of Kit Carson, was up 67.1%. About half of the ZIP Codes on the Plains had too few transactions to allow Zillow to track them, especially in Colorado’s highly distressed southeastern corner. But when enough sales information was available, housing markets on the Eastern Plains outperformed those along the northern Front Range. And that outperformance has accelerated in the past year. Of the top five performing ZIP codes on a one-year basis, three were on the Plains, led by Kit Carson and Eads. Kirk in Yuma County has joined the home appreciation party in fifth place. The pursuit of affordability seems like the most reasonable explanation, and the Eastern Plains are starting from much lower price points. Even after almost doubling, the typical home price in Kit Carson only reached $141,592 in January, according to its Zillow Home Price Index. In Las Animas, typical homes were still going for $91,377, the only Colorado ZIP code in the study still below $100,000. That’s a far cry from Woody Creek outside Aspen, the state leader with a typical home value of just under $4.4 million. Boulder’s 80304 ZIP is the leader along the Front Range at $1.4 million. “We hear from a lot of people selling their homes on the Front Range trying to find a cheaper property,” said Brock Reedy, an associate broker with Wilson Realty in Lamar. In Lamar, Zillow pegs the typical home at $165,749, even after a 53.4% increase in the past four years. Brock adds that $200,000 can buy a nice home in Lamar with some land, while it won’t even “buy a bedroom” in downtown Denver. “We have had quite a few folks coming out from the Front Range,” said Virgil George, a managing broker at the Rocking X Land Co. in Burlington near the Kanas border. Retirees not dependent on job opportunities and looking for a calmer pace of life are among those trading city life for affordable country living. Rocking X recently sold two homes where the buyers signed on the dotted line without ever touring in person, George said. Buyers working in metro Denver and Colorado Springs pushed up prices in Bennett, Strasburg, Limon and Hugo, trading affordability for a long commute before the pandemic. But Limon and Hugo saw some of the smaller gains among the Plains ZIPs in the past four years. George remains skeptical of the Zillow numbers, even though his brokerage has had a strong run despite higher interest rates. For starters, few homes switch hands out on the Plains and new construction is rare, meaning just a few sales can push the percentage change way up. Call him a skeptic, but George isn’t ready to call Cheyenne County Colorado’s hottest housing market, even if Zillow said Kit Carson led the state for home price appreciation last year and was in second place over four years.

    "content": "Outdoor kitchens boost home sale prices, according to Zillow. Zillow is out with a new list of features that reportedly help homes sell faster or for more money. It’s probably not a surprise that many of these support facets of wellness design. It’s thus fair to say that these benefits are not only financial; they’re also physical and mental. Let’s take a look at the numbers, and some insights from real estate sales professionals around the country on what they’re seeing in their markets. Home features that enhance outdoor living still trend strongly with buyers, according to real estate site: “Six of the top 10 features that help homes sell for more are outdoor features, signaling that the pandemic-era demand for functional outdoor space remains.” These features include outdoor kitchens, TVs, showers, pizza ovens, fenced yards and saltwater pools, all of which can enhance well-being. “Anything that is outdoors is hugely popular and helps to make a house sell more quickly,” comments Jay Mitchell with Berkshire Hathaway RW Towne Realty in Virginia Beach. “Because we are outdoor-oriented and along the coast with beaches, rivers and forests, people want to spend their time outdoors. Fireplaces and fire pits; fountains; ponds; patios, decks of all kinds and outdoor showers are very hot items and buyers are keen to find properties with any or all of these amenities.” Being outdoors and in contact with nature enhances physical and mental health, according to extensive research, making features even as unexpected as outdoor screens potentially wellness-enhancing. Socializing also enhances health by reducing loneliness, and outdoor televisions are often used for gatherings to watch special events. Pools and pizza ovens enhance socializing too. A fenced yard keeps children and pets in sight, and outdoor showers keep indoor floors dryer, reducing slip hazards. Both home features enhance safety, the second facet of wellness design. According to Zillow, pizza ovens help homes sell for 1.9% more, outdoor showers 2.6% more, outdoor kitchens 1.7% more, and outdoor TVs 3.1% more – “the highest sale price premium of all 359 features Zillow analyzed across nearly 1 million home sales in 2023,” according to its report. Fenced yards help homes sell 2.8 days faster, and saltwater pools speed up sales times by 2.6 days. Michelle Silverman with Coldwell Banker Realty in La Jolla agrees: “A full-functioning outdoor kitchen with a pizza oven will attract more buyers to a luxury home that can bring multiple offers and an increase in sales price, leading to a quicker sale. Another top feature that luxury buyers are looking for in a home is an outdoor cold water plunge, as well as an outdoor movie theatre which can lead to a faster sale.” It’s real estate lore that kitchens sell homes, so it’s not surprising that some of their wellness-enhancing features help homes sell faster. New York area agent Samantha Michel with Keller Williams Points North observes, “Regarding the specific features mentioned, it's important to consider the broader context of the home. For instance, the popularity of soapstone countertops has surged over the past five to eight years, suggesting that homes featuring this material may also boast recently remodeled kitchens. Given that the median home price in the country is $511,000, a 3% increase amounts to approximately $15,000, which coincidentally aligns with the cost of a new kitchen remodel. Ultimately, the perceived value of features such as a ‘pizza oven’ or a ‘she shed’ varies depending on the preferences of potential buyers.” Kitchen-adjacent features help too in larger homes, and these features reflect that too. For example, enhanced refrigeration: “A beverage center is the new wine fridge. Beverage centers can help a home fetch a 2.4% sale premium, compared to 0.9% for wine fridges. These undercounter refrigerators offer different temperature settings for different types of beverages, not only wine.” Beverage fridges let children grab after-school sips and yoga moms healthy smoothies without having to rummage through foodstuffs in the main fridge, reducing temptations and energy waste. “Beverage centers” are starting to show up in some of our listings, and not limited just to indoors – they are popping up in outdoor kitchens in addition to refrigerators. Not only that, but separate coffee bars are trending as well, particularly in homes that are being remodeled,” Mitchell notes. Zillow also noted that “#Plantparents snap up homes that mention a plant ledge in their listing description more than five days faster than expected.” Plant ledges in kitchens can enhance wellness with herb gardens for flavor, greenery for improved indoor air quality and both for biophilia benefits. “Quartz countertops help homes sell for 1.7% more – but soapstone tops are trending at 3% more!” Zillow reported. This is a mixed benefit. Both are nonporous and durable, but soapstone comes with a few negatives worth considering before selecting: ”It scratches easily and has an unpredictable patina, plus it requires regular oiling,” noted House Beautiful in its article on their pros and cons. Zillow cited other features that boost home sales. Among these were “rounded corners, popular in contemporary furniture design and now architecture (hello, curvy kitchens), can help a home sell six days faster than similar homes.” This attribute is trending for its aesthetic, but it also enhances safety, by reducing injury risk to running children and balance-challenged older adults. It can also save home fitness enthusiasts (like me) from painful encounters with cabinetry during high impact workouts. “Rounded corners just recently became a bit more popular, as builders are not really offering them as an option anymore,” notes Muriel Williams-Thompson with Town and Country Realty in Denver. The real estate platform also cited this increasingly popular feature: “She sheds helped homes sell for 2% more.” I touted the wellness benefits of she sheds as retreats in a July 2023 Forbes.com article, and a related Clubhouse conversation. (You can listen to the recording here.) And that was almost a year before the real estate benefits were touted. One of my sources for that piece was a psychologist who specializes in women’s issues. Here's what she shared about these special places: There are definitely wellness benefits to these rooms — and the time women spend in them looking after their own mental health needs. “Without this space, she can feel confined, intruded upon, perhaps resentful if her mate has his (assuming heterosexuality) own space, and fatigued because she doesn’t have a much-needed time out from household tasks and care giving.” As Michel points out, “It’s essential to recognize that merely adding a single feature doesn't guarantee a 1% to 3% increase in home value or a 2.5-day reduction in time on the market. As with any statistical analysis, it's crucial to understand that correlation does not imply causation.” *** Note: All real estate pro interviews were conducted last week by email. "

    "title": "America's young men are blowing their money like never before",
    "description": "Young men in America are gambling on sports, crypto, and meme stocks. And a whole lot of companies are making a killing off the rise in betting.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-16T09:22:01Z",
    "content": "Want to make a fortune? Target bored young men who want to make a fortune.        If you want to gamble in America these days, you have more ways to put your money on the line than ever. You've got the real-life casino, the casino on your phone, sports betting, crypto, meme stocks — even complex financial products like zero-day options can give you a quick hit of risk. For young men in particular, it's an enticing, if a bit troubling, prospect. But for a variety of companies, from sportsbooks to investing apps, an increased willingness to make some kind of gamble means business is booming. The boys-who-like-to-bet bank is open, and companies are making as many withdrawals as they can. The level at which gambling has become normalized in the United States in recent years is stunning. Americans legally bet a record $119.84 billion on sports in 2023, up from $93 billion in 2022. Since the Supreme Court in 2018 struck down a federal law prohibiting sports gambling, more than three dozen states have embraced it in some form. Seven states have also legalized iGaming, meaning online blackjack, roulette, and slot machines. And while not explicitly gambling, free trading apps such as Robinhood have gotten an increasing number of ordinary people into investing — for fun, to alleviate boredom, to try to make some extra cash. While many people have used the apps to build a stable portfolio, a good chunk of people are doing high-risk day trading or piling into meme stocks like GameStop, AMC, or, as Donald Trump's people are hoping, his newly public social-media company. Crypto is back again, and this time around, almost nobody is pretending the endeavor is about anything other than \"number go up.\" Many video games have a gambling-like aspect, too, that gets kids and adolescents into the risk-minded pipeline. While plenty of people across demographics are participating in these trends, data suggests the crowds skew younger and male. A 2023 survey from the NCAA found that sports gambling was prevalent among young adults, specifically on college campuses and among Black and Latino respondents. Pew Research found in 2022 that men and people under 50 were likelier to bet on sports than women and the over-50 crowd. Younger men tend to be more into crypto and meme-stock trading as well. This isn't surprising. Men tend to take more financial risks than women. As investors, they're more prone to overconfidence, which often leads them to trade more — and, as a result, get lower returns. Men generally gamble more than women, and they've been found to have lower levels of impulsive coping in gambling settings. The precise reason for this behavior is hard to pin down, said Timothy Fong, a clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA and the codirector of its gambling-studies program. There's a cultural component: In the '80s, young men were fed movies like \"Wall Street,\" shown flashy cars and money, and told that greed is good. In the '90s and early 2000s, they were sold on more traditional forms of gambling and poker. Now they're being marketed sports betting and crypto. But it also goes deeper than that. \"For years, when we've studied gambling behaviors as well as other addictive behaviors, the trend has always been males more than females are impacted,\" Fong said. \"People have said, well, is that a biological risk? Is that a culturally driven risk? Is that a psychological risk or a social risk factor? And basically, what I can say is that it's probably a combination.\" There may be FOMO, as in fear of missing out. Younger men see their friends playing in crypto or betting on sports, and they want to join in. Many of them have income they're not doing more productive things with, especially in the wake of a pandemic that has a lot of consumers who were once trying to save up thinking, \"Eh, screw it.\" Maybe 40 years ago a 28-year-old had a mortgage and a family to support. Now he doesn't have those responsibilities and can direct disposable income toward whichever stock he just saw recommended on Reddit or a bet on whether the next pitch in a baseball game will be a ball or a strike. Kahlil Philander, a Washington State University professor who focuses on public policy and gambling, said this gambling boom is being compounded by a novelty effect. Many young people are being exposed to gambling for the first time. and a wide variety of products are being marketed aggressively to them. All the advertising dollars that have been spent on sports-betting platforms and crypto exchanges, for example, have amplified the exposure effect. The other part of the story is that many of these people haven't gambled before: Unlike a 60-year-old who's been there, done that, they haven't internalized the downsides. \"If there are risks or risk-mitigating strategies that individuals can take, they might not have learned those lessons yet,\" Philander said. \"That can lead to higher levels of involvement, more harmful activity, all the types of things that people with more experience might have figured out for themselves one way or another.\" At the heart of this is technology is the idea that guys don't have to walk over to the casino to place a bet or call a broker to trade a stock — they can just take out their phones. \"The technology that brings us that intersection between gambling, gaming, investing, and financial risk, that technology barrier is so low right now,\" Fong said. For some young men, a level of nihilism about the economy leads to an impetus to take some risks. It shows up in movies like \"Dumb Money,\" about the GameStop phenomenon, or \"This Is Not Financial Advice,\" a documentary about dogecoin where the protagonists are portrayed as Davids against Goliaths — hedge funds, but also the economic system at large. \"We're at a place as a society where there are many new forms of gambling where the nature of investing and financial risk-taking is much different than it was before,\" Philander said. The billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has a penchant for doing some finger-wagging from time to time, described the shifting nature of investing in his latest letter to Berkshire Hathaway investors. \"For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young,\" he wrote. \"The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants.\" Along with the rise of new customers, problem-gambling behavior is increasing, especially among young men. A 2023 report on the prevalence of gambling in New Jersey — where sports betting and online gambling are legal, and where Atlantic City is — found that men had double the rate of high-risk problem gambling than women and that those ages 18 to 44 were at the highest risk. The New Jersey report identified a significant prevalence of high-risk stock trading among young men. In the state, which pushed to have the federal law prohibiting sports betting overturned, calls to its problem-gambling hotline tripled in five years, with people 25 to 34 being the likeliest to reach out. Most people who gamble don't wind up with an addiction. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, some 2.5 million Americans have a severe gambling problem, and another 5 million to 8 million have a problem it considers mild or moderate. That's a small sliver of the population. Plenty of people do some amount of betting and eventually fall off, or they dip in from time to time and are just fine. The public's interest in crypto ebbs and flows, and just because someone got into meme stocks for a while doesn't mean they're living on Wall Street Bets forever. Still, the explosion of playing so much with money in the US is worrying, especially without a lot going on in the way of regulations, education, or safeguards to keep problem gambling in check. At least a sports-betting app will nudge someone to slow down if they go too far — there are virtually no protections in place if your day-trading habit gets out of hand, and many people don't even realize that what they're doing really is gambling. Fong told me he sees patients who will have lost thousands of dollars playing stocks and insist they just didn't time the market right. \"The one question I'll ask folks, I'll say, 'Does this behavior make your life better, or does it create problems?'\" he said. \"And that's it.\" Casinos, sportsbooks, and trading platforms want to make money off bettors, and the way to do that is to get them to play more, not less. While many young men will eventually move on from their betting habits, not all of them will — and the company's hope is to turn them into clients for life.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the beverage industry and its outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Beverage Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.  A recent report by the Commerce Department highlighted a significant increase in consumer spending last month, indicating the economy’s strength. Despite facing higher borrowing costs, the US continues to surpass other countries globally, largely due to its strong labor market. Matt Shay, the president of the National Retail Federation (NRF), said that the future direction of interest rates and inflation remains uncertain. However, he emphasized that a robust job market and rising real wages are still playing a crucial role in supporting spending. If we look at individual sectors through data provided by CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor, we see that sales of food and beverages increased by 1% month-over-month and showed a 5.3% rise compared to the same period last year. The food and beverage industry has experienced significant growth over time. From embracing sustainable methods to integrating technology in operations, the industry is well-positioned for future expansion and growth. According to the Food and Beverages Global Market Report 2023, the global food and beverage industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% by 2027. Within the beverage industry, the spirits segment maintained its lead in the market share over beer and wine for the second consecutive year in 2023. The US spirits revenue increased by 0.2%, reaching $37.7 billion, according to the annual economic report from the Distilled Spirits Council of the US (DISCUS). Even with modest revenue growth, the spirits industry outperformed beer and wine sales by 0.4% and 26.1%, respectively. The report also mentioned that the pre-mixed cocktails saw the most rapid growth among spirits categories last year, experiencing a 26.7% increase in revenue to reach $2.8 billion.  Chris Swonger, president and CEO of DISCUS, spoke with CNBC about the performance of the beverage alcohol industry. He said that the spirits sector exhibited resilience, successfully sustaining its lead in the total beverage alcohol market. He further mentioned that the spirits market is now undergoing a period of adjustment. The market witnessed the rise of tech stocks last year, which overshadowed nearly every other industry. While food and beverage stocks did not perform exceptionally, the S&P Food & Beverage Select Industry Index still managed to yield a modest return of 2.5%. The index tracks the performance of companies belonging to various food and beverage sub-industries. It is up by 3.12% this year, as of April 9. Due to the tech sector’s strong performance last year and investors’ consistent inclination toward the innovation it brings to the table, one would assume that these equities have consistently delivered strong returns over the years. While that could be true to some extent, the spotlight is now on Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)’s long-term returns. From 1994 to April 8, 2024, the stock has surged by an astounding 185,400%, making headlines for its remarkable growth. The California-based beverage company mainly specializes in energy drinks, alcohol, teas, and coffees. As mentioned above, there is a noticeable shift toward sustainability within the food and beverage industry. According to a survey conducted by Deloitte among food and beverage executives, products are expected to emphasize sustainable properties in 52% of cases, organic qualities in 36%, and healthy aspects in 35%. These attributes are closely associated with clean labeling and the avoidance of ultra-processed food. Moreover, three-quarters of companies support front-of-package nutritional labeling. Within the beverage industry, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) are some of the best stocks that also pay dividends to shareholders. In this article, we will further take a look at some other beverage dividend stocks. A close-up of bottles of whisky and other alcoholic beverages from a winery. Our Methodology: To select the best beverage stocks, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds as of Q4 2023 and picked companies that are primarily involved in the production and distribution of a wide variety of liquid refreshments, including soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, coffee, tea, bottled water, energy drinks, fruit juices, sports and nutritional drinks, and dairy-based beverages.

Horizon Kinetics LLC mentioned Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) in its Q4 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “There are the securities exchanges in our strategies, of course, which we’ve adequately covered. Also, ‘2nd tier’ varieties of asset-light businesses, like car dealerships (AutoNation and Penske Auto Group) and shipping brokers (Clarkson PLC and Braemar PLC). Less well reviewed have been a few companies that are asset intensive, but have particular inflation-beneficiary attributes. One such is Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), one of the largest agricultural commodities processors. They turn grains and legumes into flour, protein meals, oils, starches, syrups, cellulose pulp, what have you. Almost everything on a dinner plate came through, in some fashion, ADM’s hands. Yes, they have machinery, terminals, ships, railroad cars. And as an intermediary, theirs is a low-margin business. But it is a constant-spread business that earns a pretty stable margin on a very large sales base. When pricing rises for a period of time, that percentage spread is on a higher dollar amount, hence more dollars of income—so income can rise nicely when agricultural commodities do. And there is the opportunity to expand their margins somewhat…” (Click here to read the full text) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 McCormick & Company, Incorporated (NYSE:MKC) is an American food company that specializes in flavoring products used in a wide variety of beverages.

    "content": "Craig C. Rowe; Canva Real estate software and marketing services firm Reliance built a new website for Hegg Realtors, South Dakota’s most tenured brokerage. Inman Connect At Inman Connect Las Vegas, July 30-Aug. 1, 2024, the noise and misinformation will be banished, all your big questions will be answered, and new business opportunities will be revealed. Join us. Real estate software and marketing services firm Reliance built a new website for Hegg Realtors, South Dakota’s most tenured brokerage, an April 16 press release shared. The website rests on the domain www.hegg.com and features Reliance’s proprietary home search experience, which the company describes as “cutting-edge” and “hyperlocal.” Hegg is an affiliate of Berkshire Hathaway and owned by Edina Realty. It was founded in 1945 when it specialized in farmland brokerage, later expanding into home sales and commercial realty. It also has a luxury division. Hegg has 170 agents in 10 offices throughout the Mount Rushmore State. “Our number one goal is to help agents sell more homes,” said Sean McRae, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Reliance, in a statement. “That requires an innovative approach to online marketing for our clients. We were so happy to be able to work side by side with the Hegg team to build a website platform that embraced their unique brand and business model, creating a true market destination for their customers and agents across South Dakota.” Reliance offers a range of business services to real estate companies on top of website development. Like its peers Luxury Presence, Elm Street Technologies, MoxiWorks and others, the company leads with creative services that integrate with more sophisticated business needs, such as a CRM, localized, SEO-driven home search and other marketing. The company also offers direct integrations with a wide array of recognized technology providers, including companies such as Adwerx, HomeSpotter, Maxa, ActivePipe and Spacio. The company’s search functionality rests on the concept of “property-centric” not “listing-centric,” which centers on a single registered URL for every property in perpetuity, each with its own unique content and set of deep, SEO-friendly data. This also helps the brokerage alleviate downstream spends on superfluous SEO upkeep or the arduous task of renovating a website to catch up with competitors. Reliance said that its search model has been area of focus of late, primarily over the last two years. The emphasis has been on developing SEO as a lead-gen tool first, as opposed to its traditional role as a website traffic driver. While Reliance has always been a client-centric company operating behind the scenes, over the past two years the firm has concentrated its efforts heavily on developing proptech’s newest search engine with an emphasis on improving search engine optimization (SEO) to drive more traffic and generate more leads and referrals for its clients. Reliance offers its own customer relationship management system (CRM), complete with agent performance metrics, marketing automations, website content management functionality, multi-source lead routing, print marketing resources, lead analysis and other features critical to agent success. It can back a customer website to create a top-down business management system, easily funneling web traffic into lead nurture efforts. “Our company and our agents are proud to be supported by a technology company whose focus is making real estate companies better,” said Gregg Gohl, CEO of Hegg in a statement. “We have been extremely happy with the professional services and support that we have received from Reliance during our recent transition.” Email Craig Rowe Simply enter the email address you used to create your account and click \"Reset Password\".

    "content": "Rubén Andrés En el mundo de las finanzas y los negocios hay pocas oportunidades tan codiciadas como la posibilidad de compartir una comida con un peso pesado de las inversiones, con más de cuatro décadas cosechando triunfos. Esa leyenda no es otro que el nonagenario millonario Warren Buffett, e invitarle a comer tiene un precio: 19 millones de dólares. Puede parecer caro, pero es por una buena causa. Durante más de dos décadas, Warren Buffett, el “Oráculo de Omaha”, ha estado subastado esta experiencia exclusiva en el marco de la campaña Power of One Charity Luncheon, recaudando millones para la fundación Glide, dedicada a ayudar a las personas sin hogar en San Francisco. En la subasta de 2022, un donante anónimo pagó 19 millones de dólares por sentarse a la mesa con Warren Buffett. La iniciativa surgió en el año 2000 a partir de una sugerencia de Susan Thompson, la ya fallecida primera esposa de Buffett. El magnate buscaba una forma de recaudar fondos para financiar la ayuda a uno de los mayores problemas de San Francisco, por lo que comenzó a subastar una “masterclass” sobre consejos de inversión, mientras comían en uno de los restaurantes preferidos de Buffet en Nueva York. Lo que en principio iba a ser una recaudación de unos pocos miles de dólares, en 2008 escaló hasta las siete cifras, dado el alto valor de los consejos que el veterano inversor ofrecía a quien corría con los gastos de la comida. El ganador de la peculiar subasta podía acudir a la comida acompañado por hasta siete invitados y, como es lógico, se esperaba que además de hacerse cargo de la consumición del restaurante, también abonara el importe de la donación prometida. Uno de los episodios más curiosos de esta subasta lo protagonizó el ejecutivo de inversiones Ted Weschler, que en 2010 pagó 2.626.311 dólares por comer con Warren Buffett. A Weschler debieron quedarle algunas preguntas en el tintero, porque en 2011 volvió a ganar la subasta con un importe de 2.626.411 dólares para volver a comer con el ‘Oráculo de Omaha’. Impresionado por su perseverancia, Warren Buffett le ofreció un empleo como gerente de inversiones en su compañía Berkshire Hathaway. Gracias a la subasta benéfica de Warren Buffett, la fundación Glide cuenta con un presupuesto anual de 31 millones de dólares. Estos fondos se usan para proveer alimentos, cuidados médicos, orientación y formación laboral y vivienda para personas sin techo y el riesgo extremo de exclusión social. Desde que Susan Thompson tuvo la idea de subastar un almuerzo con su millonario esposo, la fundación ha recaudado 53 millones de dólares con esta iniciativa, pero la avanzada edad del inversor le obliga a dar el relevo en la iniciativa benéfica en 2024 a otro peso pesado de la gestión empresarial: Marc Benioff, fundador de Salesforce. La subasta por compartir una comida con Benioff ya está programada entre los días 5 y 10 de mayo en eBay que sirve de plataforma para la subasta. La oferta inicial es de 25.000 dólares, y hay bastante expectación por ver si el millonario fundador de Salesforce atrae tanto interés como Buffett. La trayectoria de Benioff tampoco deja indiferente. A los 17 años, vendía juegos de Atari para pagarse los estudios y, tras una carrera ascendente en Oracle, fundó Salesforce en 1999.

The hospital opened in the late 19th century and closed in the late 20th, but the buildings have been carefully protected, preserved, and transformed into a 45-unit condo development. “The Asylum is Boston’s single remaining rural estate that consists of outstanding later Victorian wood-frame structures in their original setting,’' according to the Boston Landmarks Commission. “‘The Weld House’ is an exuberant representation of the French Mansard style, while ‘The Adams House’ portrays the full blown Queen Anne Revival style.” Advertisement Unit 9 is in “The Adams House,” a structure visible from Centre Street and the first one upon entering the property, which offers a heated swimming pool and tennis courts on its landscaped grounds. Access the unit via the stunning main entrance. The door to the 1,005-square-foot condo opens into a foyer with slate tile flooring. The main living areas, part of an open layout, are to the left and reflect updates that maintain touches of the building’s historic past: a wood-burning fireplace, 11-foot-high ceilings, and crown molding. The current owners have placed a long couch in front of the fireplace in the 190-square-foot living area, which features a white wooden mantel and a red brick firebox. Built-in cabinetry to the left of the fireplace presents a great place to hide your Monopoly and Scrabble games. Track lighting will help you tally the points for the latter. (Hint: According to Dictionary.com, the word “oxyphenbutazone” is legal, theoretically, and will net you 1,778 points.) Advertisement An exposed beam offers a visual barrier between the living and dining areas. Track lighting and a ceiling fan will help you keep your cool if want to nosh and play Scrabble in the dining area (149 square feet) instead. The flooring in both spaces is an engineered composite. A two-seat breakfast bar topped with a slab of earth-toned granite marks the start of the kitchen. The updated space features dark cherry cabinets, a ceramic-tile backsplash, natural stone flooring, and stainless steel appliances. The kitchen has track lighting, lights under the cabinets, and a glass-front cabinet with interior lighting. Stairs next to the kitchen lead to a French door that opens to a private deck that’s 8 feet wide and nearly 20 feet long and overlooks the grounds. The primary suite (200 square feet) sits off the living room and comes with carpeting, a ceiling fan, three double-hung windows, and a 33-square-foot walk-in closet with custom shelving. The en-suite bath features a single vanity with a manufactured top, ceramic tile flooring, and a tub/shower combination behind a curtain. The shower surround is ceramic tile. The guest bedroom and bath are off a hallway to the right of the front door. The shower-only bath has a white single vanity with a manufactured countertop and ceramic tile flooring. The guest bedroom is 152 square feet and offers a closet with bifold louvered doors, two double-hung windows, carpeting, and a working wood-burning fireplace with a white mantel.

Cooling is from window air conditioning, and the monthly fee includes heat; gas; water; sewer; insurance; structural, grounds, and road maintenance; snow and trash removal; and reserve funds.

    "title": "Michael\nJensen e o desafio de ganhar do mercado",
    "description": "Se os mercados são ineficientes, por que é tão difícil batê-los?",
    "published_at": "2024-04-17T09:00:00Z",
    "content": "iG Mail iG Mail Por  Marcelo Guterman E-mail Twitter \n\n Meu  artigo anterior nesta coluna\nfoi uma homenagemao ganhador do Prêmio Nobel, Daniel Kahneman, que faleceu há alguns dias. Kahneman é o pai das chamadas Finanças Comportamentais, em que o investidor racional é substituído por um ser humano de carne e osso, que tem mesmo é aversão a perdas, e não a algo etéreo chamado “risco”. O corolário dessa conclusão é que os mercados (formados, afinal, por seres humanos) não seriam tão eficientes quanto preconizam as teorias clássicas de finanças. Por mercados eficientes entendemos aqueles em que os preços dos ativos já embutem todas as informações disponíveis sobre eles. Em um mercado assim, não é possível ganhar de índices gerais de mercado, como o S&P500 ou o Ibovespa. Vou aqui prestar homenagem a outro expoente das finanças, também falecido nos últimos dias, mas bem menos famoso do que Kahneman. Michael Jensen foi o autor do primeiro estudo conhecido sobre eficiência do mercado acionário americano, em um artigo de 1968, The Perfomance of Mutual Funds in the Period 1945-1964\n, no Journal of Finance. Neste artigo, Jensen seleciona 115 fundos de ações nos Estados Unidos com performance disponível entre 1955 e 1964. Destes, 56 fundos também têm performance disponível entre 1945 e 1954. O estudo de Jensen consistiu em medir a performance adicional ao que se poderia esperar de cada fundo, considerando o seu risco. Para tanto, usa o CAPM, em que o risco é medido pela sensibilidade de cada fundo aos movimentos do mercado como um todo. Chamamos essa sensibilidade de “beta”. Se um fundo tem beta baixo, significa que tende a ter performance menos intensa do que a performance dos movimentos do mercado como um todo. Ou seja, se o mercado (medido, por exemplo, pelo S&P500) cair 1%, um fundo com beta igual a 0,5 tenderá a cair somente 0,5%. Este meio porcento adicional em relação ao índice (o fundo foi “menos pior” do que o índice) não foi “mérito” do gestor do fundo, mas simplesmente fruto de menos risco. Isso significa que um investidor sem expertise algum poderia obter o mesmo resultado simplesmente investindo metade da sua carteira no S&P500 e mantendo a outra metade em caixa. Neste mesmo exemplo, se o fundo tivesse obtido retorno de zero, este 1% adicional ao S&P500 (lembre-se, o S&P500 caiu 1%) seria apenas parcialmente explicado pelo seu beta. O restante seria fruto da expertise do gestor, não explicado pelo risco do fundo. Jensen fez essa conta para todos os 115 fundos, e descobriu que, na média, este “ganho adicional” era, na verdade, uma perda. Mais especificamente, -1,1% ao ano. Ou seja, na média, os fundos de ações nos Estados Unidos entregaram 1,1% ao ano a menos do que se poderia esperar pelo risco assumido no período considerado. Isso depois de cobrada a taxa de administração. Antes da cobrança, esse retorno adicional foi de -0,1%, ou seja, praticamente zero, o que significa que, na média, os fundos de ações nos Estados Unidos simplesmente seguiam o mercado e, para isso, cobravam uma taxa de administração de aproximadamente 1% ao ano. Depois de Jensen, milhares de outros acadêmicos testaram essa hipótese para vários mercados em vários países, inclusive no Brasil, ao longo dos anos. Este artigo não tem a pretensão de fazer uma revisão dessa literatura, mas simplesmente colocar a discussão: afinal, os mercados são ou não eficientes? Segundo o levantamento de Jensen, o mercado acionário americano foi eficiente entre 1945 e 1964, pois, na média, os fundos não conseguiram batê-lo. Isso não significa, contudo, que nenhum fundo tenha conseguido gerar retornos adicionais ao risco assumido. Dentre os 115 fundos, 49 conseguiram este retorno adicional, inclusive para pagar a taxa de administração. Um dos fundos, inclusive, gerou mais de 5% ao ano adicionais durante o período. O problema, claro, é saber quais fundos gerarão retornos adicionais no futuro. Sem nenhuma informação adicional, a média fala mais alto, pois selecionaremos um ou mais fundos aleatoriamente dentre os disponíveis. Quando pensamos em investidores de sucesso, o nome de Warren Buffett se destaca. Com certeza, o mago de Omaha é um desses que já demonstrou expertise para bater os mercados. Sua empresa, a Berkshire Hathaway, que é o seu veículo de investimentos, apresentou a estonteante marca de 3.777.837% de retorno entre 1965 e 2022, contra 24.328% do S&P500 no mesmo período. Nada mal! Mas vamos olhar um pouco mais de perto. No gráfico a seguir, mostramos os retornos acumulados do fundo em janelas de 10 anos, comparados com os retornos do S&P500 nas mesmas janelas: \n\n A primeira barra cinza significa que a Berkshire Hathaway rendeu um pouco mais de 10% ao ano acima do S&P500 no decênio que vai de 1965 a 1974. No decênio seguinte, 1966 a 1975, a empresa rendeu um pouco menos de 5% ao ano a mais do que o S&P500 nesse período, e assim por diante, para cada janela de 10 anos. O melhor decênio foi o de 1976-1985, quando o fundo rendeu nada menos do que 36% ao ano\nacima do S&P500. Observe agora o que acontece a partir do ano de 2011. No decênio que vai de 2002 a 2011, a empresa gera apenas 1,3% ao ano. E, no decênio seguinte (2003-2012), pela primeira vez em sua história, a empresa não consegue bater o S&P500 nesse período, rendendo 0,8% ao ano abaixo do índice. Note que os retornos são bem menores a partir de 2011, em comparação com as janelas anteriores. No período de 19 anos que vai de 2004 a 2022, a Berkshire Hathaway rendeu 542,9%, contra 549,2% do S&P500. O que será que aconteceu? Será que Buffett perdeu o seu “toque de Midas”? Provavelmente, não. Acontece que a sua empresa ficou muito grande, e encontrar investimentos que façam a diferença se tornou mais difícil. Por isso certos fundos fecham para captação, para não ficarem muito grandes a ponto de não conseguirem mais bater o mercado. Isso acontece porque as distorções de mercado normalmente são pequenas em relação ao mercado como um todo. O que significa dizer que as ineficiências são rápidas e localizadas, enquanto os grandes mercados são, em geral, eficientes. O fato é que Buffett provavelmente deu algumas grandes tacadas nos primeiros anos da empresa, o que lhe permite mostrar retornos acumulados impressionantes, mas agora (nos últimos 20 anos) está tendo desempenho semelhante ao mercado como um todo. São inúmeras as histórias de gestores que apresentam uma excelente performance no início, e depois, aparentemente, perdem a mágica. Por exemplo, esta reportagem da Bloomberg\n, sobre a sucessão na Bridgewater Associates, o famoso hedge fund da lenda Ray Dalio, comenta sobre o maior desafio de seu sucessor: acalmar clientes após anos de baixo retorno. Hoje, a empresa faz a gestão de US$ 75 bilhões, de um pico de US$ 100 bilhões. No Brasil, o fundo Verde é o mais famoso. Sua performance histórica é estupenda. Desde o seu início, em 1997, acumula retorno (até 2023) de nada menos do que 24.436%, contra um CDI que rendeu “só” 2.983% no mesmo período. Mas como o fundo tem se saído nos últimos tempos? O gráfico abaixo, o mesmo que fizemos para o Berkshire Hathaway, vai mostrar: \n\n Vemos aqui o mesmo fenômeno que acometeu Warren Buffett: na medida em que o fundo cresceu, seus retornos foram diminuindo. Na última janela de 10 anos, o Verde rendeu 1,7% acima do CDI ao ano, o que não deixa de ser um excelente retorno, mas muito distante do que mostrou no início, quando entregava algo acima de 10% ao ano na mesma janela de tempo. Quando um fundo fica muito grande, os seus movimentos podem, inclusive, precipitar mudanças significativas nos mercados. É histórica a intervenção do também lendário George Soros no mercado de moedas em 1992, quando dizem que o investidor húngaro “quebrou” o Banco Central da Inglaterra com as suas apostas. Ocorre que o fundo de Soros era muito grande, e para que a sua posição contra a libra esterlina fizesse alguma diferença, tinha que ser muito grande também. A discussão é se, não fosse a intervenção de Soros, a libra teria se desvalorizado como se desvalorizou, em uma espécie de profecia autorrealizável. Eu discuto com detalhe esse tema em meu livro Descomplicando o Economês\n. Michael Jensen e Daniel Kahneman, que faleceram com uma diferença de 6 dias, trouxeram perspectivas opostas sobre investimentos. O primeiro provou que os gestores de fundos de ações nos Estados Unidos não conseguiram bater de maneira consistente o S&P500, sugerindo, com isso, que o mercado acionário americano é eficiente. O segundo demonstrou que o ser humano não segue a racionalidade que resultaria em mercados eficientes. Como conciliar as duas visões? Penso que há dois aspectos que podem ajudar aqui. O primeiro refere-se ao tamanho e liquidez dos mercados. Quanto menor e menos líquido, menos eficiente será o mercado. Aliás, isso já estava previsto por Markowitz, que elencou uma série de premissas para que um mercado fosse eficiente, dentre elas, o número de investidores e a liquidez. O segundo aspecto refere-se à capacidade dos gestores. Alguns são mais hábeis do que outros, o que lhes permite aproveitar as ineficiências dos mercados. Na pesquisa de Jensen, os gestores não batem o mercado na média, mas alguns conseguem efetivamente gerar retornos adicionais ajustados ao risco. O problema, meu caro investidor, é descobrir quem é esse gestor. Como mostram os históricos de Buffett, Dalio e Stuhlberger, é preciso descobrir o bom gestor no início, quando o fundo é pequeno e as oportunidades podem ser aproveitadas. Depois, quando o gestor é descoberto por todo mundo, os retornos se tornam mais comuns. E aí, quem será o próximo Buffett? ** Marcelo Guterman é engenheiro de produção pela Escola Politécnica da USP e Mestre em Economia e Finanças pelo Insper.

    "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\tBanky v Česku stále hledí na bitcoin a krypto jako na nežádoucí jev.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t• Zdroj: DALL-E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t V Česku by se mohlo brzy odehrát volné pokračování jednoho z nejzajímavějších byznysových příběhů letošního roku. V lednu vstoupil bitcoin prostřednictvím burzovně obchodovaných fondů na Wall Street a vzbudil ve formě ETF nevídaný zájem investorů. Kryptoměna, která od svého vzniku nesla tak trochu i známku punku a rebelie, tím symbolicky oblékla sako a kravatu. Investovat do bitcoinu přes ETF znamená vzdát se možnosti jím platit nebo držet ve vlastní digipeněžence. Populární heslo bitcoinové komunity „buďte sami sobě bankou“ tímto krokem ztrácí na významu. A z pohledu skalních bitcoinistů bude hůř. K pomyslnému vykleštění myšlenky bitcoinu by se mohly přidat i v Česku působící banky. Důležitý krok k tomu udělala vláda, když ve středu schválila vnoření evropské kryptoregulace do paragrafů zákona o digitálních financích. To může mít v nejbližších letech řadu zajímavých vedlejších dopadů. Byznys kolem virtuálních měn tím snadněji získá nálepku regulovaného důvěryhodného odvětví. Někteří poslanci by navíc chtěli při hlasování o digitálních financích ve sněmovně prosadit férovější danění zisků z kryptoměn podle stejného principu jako u akcií. Regulace může vzbuzovat naděje i v tom směru, že by mohla pomoci do budoucna vykořenit prodejce nejrůznějších podvodných tokenů. Seriózní obchodníci s kryptoměmami se ale zároveň bojí, aby je nové předpisy neudusily – regulace vyžaduje získání licence od České národní banky. Podvodníci lákající přes sociální sítě nebo telefonáty na zaručené výdělky z krypta díky AI ale o žádnou licenci žádat nebudou. Totéž platí i pro banky. Pokud by chtěly svým klientům nabízet investice do kryptoměn, bude jim stačit tento záměr jen oznámit regulátorovi. Za hranicemi Česka už takové spojenectví krypta a tradičního finančnictví funguje. Například rakouská regionální banka Raiffeisen už tento druh investic zprostředkovává. Bez ohledu na to, že v Česku její bankovní sestřenice odmítá vést stejně jako ostatní banky kryptofirmám účty a považuje investice do bitcoinu a spol. za rizikové nejen pro klienty, ale kvůli obavám z praní peněz i pro svůj vlastní byznys. To se může změnit. Optimisté věří, že regulace krypta jednak převrátí neochotu bank vést kryptofirmám účty, jednak je přiměje bitcoiny a spol. rovnou nabízet a tím i popularizovat u lidí kryptoměnami dosud nepolíbených. Skeptici očekávají, že na odříznutí českých kryptopodnikatelů od účtů se nezmění nic a finanční domy si akorát byznys s obchodováním s bitcoiny uzurpují pro sebe. Jisté je, že kryptobyznys dozraje do další fáze. Bylo by načase. Česko je sice sídlem řady bitcoinových milionářů, některé kryptoměnové firmy dosahují miliardových obratů a jejich zakladatelé mají nakročeno do žebříčku nejbohatších Čechů, ale z pohledu bank, úřadů a některých tradičních investorů je mnohdy celý byznys kolem bitcoinu a krypta pochybný.   Současné dění kolem kryptoměn v Česku proto nezačíná připomínat jen příběh vstupu bitcoinu na Wall Street, ale dává vzpomenout i na počátky rozmachu českého videoherního průmyslu. Ten rovněž doprovázely místy bizarní obavy tradičních institucí. Školy se hrozily z představy, jak hraní stříleček na počítači povede k prudkému růstu kriminality mladistvých. Kulturní publicisté jako Radovan Holub psali na sklonku minulého století o hrách jako o kultuře kriplů, čímž pomohli na chvíli zarámovat mladé odvětví jako útočiště asociálů a podivínů, kteří si s jedničkami a nulami rozumějí více než s lidmi. Teď patří počítačové hry k tomu nejvýdělečnějšímu, co tahle země světu nabízí. Nikdo ale nedokáže říct, jestli by tomu tak bylo i v případě, pokud by vývojářská studia měla problém se získáním bankovního účtu. Kryptoměna bitcoin se dostala do oběhu 3. ledna 2009. Během patnácti let existence zaujala nejen vývojem svého kurzu, ale i tím, jaké reakce vzbudila mezi známými podnikateli, investory nebo politiky. Následuje chronologicky řazený výčet silných výroků o nejstarší virtuální měně. „Pokud tomu nevěříš nebo nerozumíš, nemám čas tě přesvědčovat, sorry.“ Reakce dodnes neznámého tvůrce bitcoinu Satoshiho Nakamota, když na diskuzním fóru popisoval technické parametry kryptoměny. „Od peněžního systému chceme, aby zprostředkovával transakce a aby díky tomu rostlo hospodářství jako celek. V případě bitcoinu se ale nic takového neděje. Na něm bohatnou ti, kteří ho mají dostatek a neutrácejí.“ Lauerát Nobelovy ceny za ekonomii Paul Krugman. „Držte se od bitcoinu dál. Je to v podstatě jen šálení smyslů.“ Šéf Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett se o čtyři roky později zmínil o bitcoinu znovu kriticky. Vyjádřil přesvědčení, že virtuální měna špatně skončí, a přirovnal ji k jedu na krysy. Výrok šéfa hnutí ANO a jednoho z nejbohatších obyvatel Česka zdobil i jednu ze zdí v pražských Holešovicích.|archiv E15 „Vůbec netuším, co to je, a pokud vím, tak nikdo bitcoinem neplatí. Ta měna nemá nějakou dobrou pověst.\" Andrej Babiš v roli ministra financí takto komentoval zprávu, že kryptoměnu bylo možné koupit i na pobočkách České pošty. „Bitcoin je ukazatelem toho, jak velká je ve světě poptávka po praní špinavých peněz.“ Larry Fink, šéf společnosti BlackRock, která je největším správcem aktiv na světě. V roce 2023 ale svůj názor změnil. Právě jeho firma se začala připravovat na spuštění prvního bitcoinového burzovně-obchodovaného fondu (ETF). Růst kurzu bitcoinu na podzim 2023 navíc glosoval slovy, že jde o přesun investorů za kvalitou, a tou kvalitou je podle Finka právě dominantní kryptoměna. „Bitcoin je příklad investice, na který sedí teorie většího hlupáka. Sama o sobě kryptoměna nic neprodukuje. Kdybych si teď mohl vsadit na její pokles, udělám to.“ Zakladatel Microsoftu Bill Gates, později, v roce 2022, na téma kryptoměn dodal, že kdo má méně peněz než Elon Musk, neměl by bitcoin vůbec kupovat. „V době, kdy na standardní měně máte úroky pod úrovní inflace, jenom blázen by se nedíval po alternativách. Konkrétně bitcoin je skoro stejný bullshit jako ty běžné peníze. Klíčové slovo je ,skoro’“. Elon Musk, šéf Tesly a SpaceX, jehož firmy drží bitcoiny ve své rozvaze.  „Když zahrabete zlato na zahradě, bude to stále zlato i za tisíce let. Ale když o bitcoin přestanou mít zájem těžaři, ztratí na hodnotě. Je to zranitelné aktivum.“ Nassim Nicholas Taleb na investiční konferenci SH!FTS.|e15 Michaela Szkanderová „Já céčka kupovat nechci.“ Na stejné konferenci jako Taleb se kriticky vůči kryptoměnám jako takovým vymezil šéf EPH a spolumajitel vydavatele deníku e15 Daniel Křetínský.|E15 Michaela Szkanderová "

The area provides an always-on-holiday lifestyle, and, though investment in real estate is no longer a qualifying option, it has been a discreet magnet for those taking advantage of Portugal’s Golden Visa Residency Program.\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tF1's Charles Leclerc Snaps Up a Condo at One of South Florida's Ritziest New Towers\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis Modern L.A. Mansion Has a Separate Guest Apartment in the Backyard\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA Late Guitar Legend's Former Beverly Hills House Can Be Yours for $3 Million\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\tThe somewhat under-the-radar area, prized for its natural beauty, includes the prestigious Quinta do Lago resort, which borders the Ria Formosa National Park. There are a trio of golf courses and a country club or two, along with a private lagoon for nautical sports as well as direct access over a long duckwalk to a pristine stretch of white-sand beach with a beachfront restaurant.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tA recently completed home in Quinta do Lago, a bold, sinuous concrete, copper, and glass structure, sits on a nearly three-quarter-acre parcel with long views that extend over the lagoon to Quinta do Lago Beach. Known as Bailarina Villa, the extraordinary property has floated onto the market for €24.5 million (or about $26.1 million). Measuring more than 12,000 square feet—and nearly 17,000 square feet when including the terraces—there are a total of six bedrooms and eight bathrooms. \n\n \n\tEvoking the daring designs of visionary American architect John Lautner, the biophilic home is absolutely unlike any of the surrounding residences, which are a cross-section of tile-roofed Mediterranean mansions, from Tuscan villas to Spanish haciendas. The muscular, curved concrete shell, an attention-drawing cipher from the leafy street, is sliced by a series of slender vertical windows and embellished with copper accents. A cluster of lighted orbs at the top of a gentle ramp signifies the entrance, a massive, two-story-tall wooden door that pivots open to a view through the house and over the surrounding landscape. \n\tThe fortified street façade gives way to radical transparency. Throughout its three stories, retractable glass walls bulge and curl into one another, effectively blurring the ability to accurately discern indoor spaces from the sweeping terraces. Underwater walls of glass in the swimming pool further enhance the interplay between interior and exterior spaces, while the extensive use of hardwoods and other natural materials, including verdant living walls of foliage, connects the home to its natural surroundings.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tAmong its highlights are an atrium-style foyer with a floating staircase illuminated by a massive domed skylight; a channel of water that cuts through the living room; a dining room table that seats 20; a lavish games/billiards lounge; and a spa complex with a cold pool and sauna. The primary bedroom is a private retreat with a spa-style bath. \n\tWater cascades over the curving edge of the mosaic-tiled swimming pool into a vast, shallow pool on the lower level, over which lily pad-like overlapping circles of concrete steppingstones meander over the surface to a sunken lounge with a fire pit at its circular center. A party-sized spa is positioned beneath the roof’s curved overhang on the uppermost floor, while a bed hung from chains sways gently in the coastal breezes while taking an alfresco nap. The whole shebang is capped by a rooftop deck designed for both daytime and nighttime entertainment. There’s a large bar area and a fire pit with cushioned built-in seating, as well as a second spa, all with panoramic views. \nBailarina Villa is represented by Markus Canter at Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties. \nClick here for more photos of Bailarina Villa.

    "title": "Wildfires Are Upending Some of the Safest Bets on Wall Street",

    "published_at": "2024-04-18T05:00:47Z",
    "content": "When the Texas Panhandle went up in flames this winter, the news spread fast on Wall Street. An electric utility by the name of Xcel Energy Inc. was getting blamed for the massive blaze — a lawsuit pointed the finger at its dilapidated equipment — and this was making the company’s investors very nervous. Throughout the morning of Feb. 29, investors unloaded shares. By early that afternoon, the stock was down nearly 10%. Bond prices were sinking too, triggering a spike in Xcel’s yields. For money managers who had long treated the utility’s bonds as an uber-safe asset — something almost akin to a US Treasury note — the rout, while brief, was jarring. It sent the latest in a series of warnings on climate change to an investing community that’s plowed some $1.7 trillion into the stocks and bonds of power companies that trade on Wall Street. For years, these assets have been seen as safe bets for retirement and insurance funds for a simple reason: Selling electricity is about as steady, and crucial, an industry as there is. These businesses are regulated monopolies and, the thinking has gone, too important too fail. But as climate change exacerbates droughts and wildfires, and utilities often take the blame for starting them, their assets are increasingly at risk. Few industries in America will be more directly impacted by fires — both physically and financially — than the power sector, experts say. Already the financial pain is piling up. Over the past eight months, investors have driven down the value of Hawaiian Electric stock by 73% after the company was blamed for the deadly Maui blaze. Its bond due in 2045 is trading at 62 cents on the dollar. A few years earlier, shares of PG&E Corp. plunged after it caused wildfires in California that would eventually force it to declare bankruptcy. And fires have stuck PacifiCorp with such heavy losses that its parent company Berkshire Hathaway said it could wipe out all of its energy division’s profits. Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman, admitted he made a “costly mistake” in not anticipating the surge in these expenses. “Investors realize this is a big problem, but they don’t know how big of a problem it is for a particular utility,” says Michael Wara, a wildfire expert and director of the climate and energy policy program at Stanford University. They’re essentially “flying blind,” he says. “A bad September afternoon wildfire can cause the stock to fall by 80% or as a bond investor, you could land as an unsecured creditor in a bankruptcy proceeding.”  The losses have, so far at least, been more acute and lasted longer on the stocks side than the bond side. This makes a certain amount of sense. While soaring costs may erase profits — the lifeblood of any thriving stock — the too-important-to-fail element to these utilities means that in many cases state governments will prop them up enough to allow them to keep paying their debts. Still, to Andy DeVries, an analyst for CreditSights Inc., investors are shrugging off the “hidden risk” that wildfires and litigation pose to their portfolios. “This risk is not a one-time thing,” says DeVries, who has covered debt markets for more than two decades. “It’s not a cyclical thing. It’s here to stay, and it’s going to get worse.” Wildfires have been breaking out more frequently and burning more and longer as the climate changes — with blazes seen from the US west to Canada, Siberia and the Australian bush. Read More: Big Texas Blaze Shows Power-Line Fires Are Widespread Threat The Smokehouse Creek Fire erupted in northern Texas in late February. Over the course of almost three weeks, it charred more than one million acres and even spread into western Oklahoma. The blaze destroyed power lines, homes and cars and killed thousands of livestock animals and two people. “These investors are looking to sleep at night — and now, all of sudden, they are waking up to wildfires,” says DeVries. Xcel was promptly sued before investigators had officially determined the cause. In an unusually swift determination, a state probe found that a broken wooden pole owned by Xcel toppled in high winds and started the blaze. Kevin Coss, a representative for Xcel, says the company has and will continue to enhance its fire-risk mitigation efforts. “We have already advanced a number of wildfire risk reduction initiatives,” Coss says. “Like all energy companies, we are navigating changes in weather and climate-induced impacts on our operations.” Many utilities are being forced to borrow more in corporate debt markets, straining their finances, to upgrade aging infrastructure and pay off claims. This has pushed sales of utility bonds up at a faster clip than those in other blue-chip industries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Buffett’s PacifiCorp sold $3.8 billion of investment-grade bonds this year to, in part, help fund settlement claims related to fires that broke out in Oregon. Edison International’s Southern California Edison — which agreed in February to pay $80 million to resolve a lawsuit related to blazes in 2017 — issued $3.6 billion of bonds in the past six months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even Xcel sold an $800 million note in February, only to see its yield over US Treasuries quickly balloon to a peak of 1.62 percentage points, from 1.25 points when it was issued. It’s the type of blowout in so-called risk premiums typically seen in riskier junk debt — not an investment-grade utility bond. “You want to be very careful,” says Arvind Narayanan, co-head of investment-grade credit at Vanguard Group.  About a quarter of credit-rating downgrades in the industry over the past five years have been related to extreme weather events, according to Fitch Ratings. Xcel lost its A- credit rating when S&P Global Ratings cut the company to just three steps from junk. Its outlook remains negative, implying that further downgrades are possible. “When we talk to the rating agencies and investors, they are right up front asking: ‘What does your wildfire mitigation plan look like?”‘ says Randy Howard, general manager of the Northern California Power Agency, which represents several locally-owned utilities. “It’s one of the first questions they ask today.” Credit scores are crucially important to utilities, one of the most capital intensive industries in the US, says Emily Fisher, the general counsel for the Edison Electric Institute, the main industry group for investor-owned utilities. That’s because investment-grade companies can typically raise cash more cheaply in corporate debt markets than those with riskier scores. Hence the effort by utilities to inform federal lawmakers about the issue and lobby for reforms at the state level. Utah, for example, has adopted legislation that caps utility wildfire liabilities, while California set up a wildfire insurance fund meant to backstop utilities involved in catastrophic blazes. That, a cap on shareholder utility liabilities and other regulatory reforms helped stabilize the finances of the state’s utilities after PG&E and Edison were blamed for multi-billion-dollar fires. PG&E was recently upgraded by all three major credit assessors, leaving the company’s credit score just one notch below investment grade, says Jonathan Arnold, vice president of investor relations for PG&E. The protection afforded by the wildfire fund has allowed PG&E to make billions of dollars of investment in fortifying its grid against blazes, Arnold adds. “Constant access to affordable capital, which is essential for a healthy utility and to keep customer rates low, is threatened by unchecked wildfire litigation,” says Tiffany Erickson, communications director at PacifiCorp. A spokesperson for Edison International also pointed to recent credit upgrades, which came alongside fire-risk reduction efforts and the state fire insurance fund. Hawaiian Electric declined to comment. Recent fires have been “a wakeup call” to Portland General Electric Co.’s Chief Financial Officer Joe Trpik. In a 133-page wildfire mitigation plan, his company laid out projects that aim to minimize risk that the utility would ever be responsible for future wildfires. The company’s projected operating and maintenance costs for 2024 is more than $815 million. The trick, for Trpik and other power executives, is financing for these projects while still transitioning toward greener energy — and without cranking up customer bills too much and fanning inflation. “Here in Oregon, we are seeing, feeling and experiencing the impacts of climate change,” he says. “It’s a challenge. It’s not something anyone should take lightly.” Read More: Portland General Electric Eyes Bonds for Wildfire Prevention  Stanford’s Wara says investors should do their due-diligence and press utilities about the precautions they’ve taken to reduce wildfire risk. Climate experts consistently warn that extreme weather events are going to happen more frequently and at higher intensities, and wildfires are notoriously challenging to predict. “You’re always looking over your shoulder when something happens,” says Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at Madison Investments, which manages $25 billion. “There is enough to worry about in the investing world other than a fire in Texas.” \nTopics\nCalifornia\nCatastrophe\nNatural Disasters\nTexas\nWildfire\n Was this article valuable?

    "published_at": "2024-04-18T05:00:33Z",
    "content": "An attorney for two people who died of a rare lung cancer argued this week for a jury to hold BNSF Railway responsible for pollution in a small Montana town near the U.S.-Canada border where thousands of people were exposed to toxic asbestos dust. The railroad — now owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. — hauled asbestos-tainted vermiculite from a nearby mine through Libby, Montana, over decades. How much BNSF knew about the health hazard from those shipments is it at the center of a weekslong civil trial that began Monday. Attorneys for the railroad said it was told repeatedly that the product it was shipping through Libby was safe. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2009 declared the first-ever public health emergency during a Superfund cleanup in Libby. It’s one of the deadliest sites under the federal pollution program. The W.R. Grace & Co. mine that operated most of last century on a mountaintop outside Libby produced contaminated vermiculite that health officials say has sickened more than 3,000 people and led to several hundred deaths. The pollution has been largely cleaned up. Yet the long latency period of asbestos diseases has meant people have continued getting sick with lung problems. The estates of Thomas Wells of LaConner, Oregon, and Joyce Walder of Westminster, California, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against BNSF in 2021. They argue the railroad and its corporate predecessors stored asbestos-laden vermiculite in a large rail yard in Libby — before shipping it to plants across the U.S. where it was heated to expand for use as insulation in millions of homes and businesses. Plaintiffs’ attorney Mark Lanier said the dangers of asbestos were well known by the industry yet BNSF never took steps to warn the people of Libby. He added that W.R. Grace, the mining company, started putting warning signs on its vermiculite rail cars as early as 1977. The trial, Lanier said, was about “did (the railroad) expose Libby residents to wind-born asbestos contamination.” BNSF attorney Chad Knight said the railroad was required under law to accept the vermiculite for shipment and had been told by W.R. Grace that it was safe. The onus was on the shipper to tell the railroad if it was hazardous, Knight said. Numerous other lawsuits alleging BNSF exposed Libby residents to asbestos are pending, court records show. The Walder and Wells lawsuit is the first so-called community exposure case against BNSF to go to trial, almost 25 years after federal authorities arrived in Libby following news reports about widespread deaths and illnesses. People who lived and worked in Libby breathed in the microscopic needle-shaped asbestos fibers that can cause lung scarring and the lung cancer mesothelioma, the lawsuit argues. Wells, 65, died in March 2020, a day after giving a 1/2-hour recorded deposition for the lawsuit. He talked about his exposure during seasonal work for the U.S. Forest Service in the Libby area in late 1970s and early 1980s. Wells said he was diagnosed with mesothelioma in late 2019 after feeling an ache in his back and developing a serious cough. He said the pain was intolerable and that he had to sell his house to help cover medical bills. Walder 66, died in October 2020. She lived in Libby for at least 20 years and could have been exposed to asbestos while fishing and floating on a river that flowed past a spot where vermiculite was loaded onto train cars, according to court records. Her exposure may have also come from playing around a baseball field near the rail yard or walking along the railroad tracks and occasionally heating up pieces of vermiculite to watch it puff up, the records said. The trial, presided over by U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris, is expected to last three weeks. BNSF said in court documents filed in advance of the trial that when low levels of asbestos were found in the Libby rail yard during testing in 2001, the railroad cleaned up the site to protect its employees. But an expert for the plaintiffs said BNSF and its predecessors sponsored geologic reports in the area and knew as early as the 1920s that the vermiculite mined near Libby had asbestos. By the 1930s the railroad would have known asbestos exposure could be hazardous, based on research disseminated at the time through the Association of American Railroads, said plaintiffs’ expert Julie Hart, who chairs the Department of Safety, Health and Industrial Hygiene at Montana Technological University. Late Sunday night, the railroad requested a last-minute delay in the trial and a change of venue to a different state, citing a weekend story by The Associated Press about the trial and asbestos contamination in Libby. Attorneys for the railroad said prospective jurors would be prejudiced by the article, which quoted a 61-year-old Libby resident who has an asbestos-related disease as saying he used to play in and around the rail yard. Morris instead allowed the trial to proceed after telling attorneys not to talk to the news media while it’s ongoing. Another case against BNSF Railway alleging community — rather than work-related — exposure to asbestos is scheduled to go to trial next month in U.S. District Court in Missoula. It was brought by the estate of Mary Diana Moe, 79, who died of mesothelioma in December 2022. \nTopics\nMontana\n Was this article valuable? Thank you!

His previous purchase of stakes in trading firms provided an endorsement of the nation’s shares that helped propel the Nikkei 225 to a record high. “This is good news for Japanese equities, and may be a buying signal for Japan stocks,” said Takehiko Masuzawa, head of equities trading at Phillip Securities Japan Ltd. “This could change the trend of Japanese equities, which have been selling off for profits.” Buffett said in his annual letter in February that Berkshire has funded most of its investment in Japanese companies through yen bond offerings. Berkshire has said it hopes to eventually own 9.9% of each of the five major trading houses in which it’s invested. Read: Buffett Endorses Japan Trading Firms in Letter, Boosting Shares The deal was also a key test of appetite for yen-denominated bonds as concern eases in the credit market that the Bank of Japan will raise interest rates again soon. It was one of the biggest yen bond sales by an overseas issuer since the BOJ scrapped the world’s last negative interest-rate regime last month. Spreads on yen corporate bonds from both domestic and overseas issuers tightened to around 51 basis points on Wednesday, from around 66 basis points a year ago, according to a Bloomberg index. The size of the deal “was a big surprise,” said Haruyasu Kato, a fund manager in Tokyo at Asset Management One Co. The largest tranche of the deal was a three-year note, with Berkshire raising ¥169 billion from that tenor alone, more than it got in total from its last bond sale in November. As an overseas issuer Berkshire offered a coupon of almost 1% on that tenor, significantly higher than similar-maturity notes sold by Japanese companies, Kato said. The extra yield was still less than Berkshire’s bond sales over the past two years. For the three-year maturity, for example, the Omaha-based firm offered a spread of 51 basis points over mid swaps, versus 59 basis points in November and 75 basis points in April 2023. Buffett’s firm is a regular issuer of yen bonds, and has tapped the market twice a year in 2023 and 2022. Here’s a look at how much Berkshire paid on some maturities over the past two years: The latest bond sale “will be a tailwind for trading company stocks in which Buffett has invested, and if a report showing large shareholdings in bank or insurance stocks as well, it will be a surprise and likely trigger a ‘Buy Japan’ trend,” Phillip Securities’ Masuzawa said. Berkshire’s stakes in trading firms include 8.58% of Mitsubishi Corp., 7.47% of Itochu Corp. and 8.41% of Marubeni Corp., according to the latest information compiled by Bloomberg. Buffett’s equity picks in these companies have outperformed and any renewed backing may give a fresh boost to Japan stocks.

    "content": "The late Charlie Munger, the esteemed investor and vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., chose a path less traveled by those of immense wealth. Known for his sharp wit and wise investment strategies, Munger amassed a fortune but remained dedicated to a remarkably modest lifestyle. For over 70 years, he lived in the same understated home, avoiding the lavish living standards that often accompany financial success. In an interview with CNBC, before he died at age 99, Munger discussed his choice to maintain a simple life despite his wealth. He and Warren Buffett observed many wealthy friends who opted for luxurious, expansive homes only to find their happiness didn’t increase. “And I would say in practically every case, they make the person less happy, not happier,” Munger said. This observation reinforced his commitment to simplicity, believing that grandeur could adversely affect one's happiness and family life.

Want To Grow Your Wealth Passively? Unlock Real Wealth with Cityfunds’ Exclusive 8% Yield Fund. Munger’s lifestyle was grounded in a philosophy that valued utility over extravagance. He noted that while a larger home might increase one’s ability to host gatherings, it brings little else of value and is costly. He also expressed concern about the impact of visible wealth on his children, suggesting that an extravagant lifestyle might encourage them to “live grandly” in ways that were not wholesome or beneficial. Munger, a father to nine children from two marriages, believed a humble living environment is crucial to fostering the right values. Despite his considerable wealth, Munger’s professional background as a real estate attorney gave him a unique perspective on property ownership. He owned other real estate investments, yet he chose to make his permanent residence in a modest home. This decision was not for lack of opportunity to live more grandly but was a deliberate choice to model values of contentment and restraint. Trending Want to Create a Passive Income Stream? These High-Yield Real Estate Notes Might Be Your Holy Grail Buffett, Munger's longtime business partner, shares a similar view on living modestly. Buffett has resided in the same Omaha, Nebraska, home he purchased for $31,500 in 1958. At Berkshire Hathaway's 2014 shareholder meeting, he said that owning multiple homes would likely decrease, not increase, his quality of life. Despite his billionaire status, Munger's views resonate with recent findings published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study suggests that while money can enhance happiness, this tends to plateau at an income of around $500,000 annually. Munger was committed to living a simple, disciplined life, which serves as a powerful example in today's material-driven society. His philosophy reiterates the idea that true happiness and fulfillment derive not from accumulating possessions but from focusing on family, meaningful work and maintaining personal integrity.

    "content": "\n\t\tThanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.\t Attorneys for a Warren Buffett-owned railway are expected to argue before a jury on Friday that the railroad should not be held liable for hauling asbestos into a Montana town that allegedly sickened — and even killed — hundreds. BNSF Railway has argued that the nation’s largest freight railroad’s predecessors — before Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bought the firm in 2010 and took it private — didn’t know the vermiculite it hauled over decades from a nearby mine in Libby, Mont., was filled with hazardous microscopic asbestos fibers, according to Fortune. How much BNSF knew about the health hazard from those shipments dating back to at least 2009 — when the US Environmental Protection Agency first declared a public health emergency because of the Libby site — is it at the center of a weeks-long civil trial that began on April 8, Fortune reported. Health officials have concluded that the contaminated vermiculite —  a naturally occurring mineral often used in construction — sickened more than 3,000 people and led to several hundred deaths. According to the Mayo Clinic, exposure to asbestos fibers “can cause lung tissue scarring and shortness of breath,” leading to a condition called Asbestosis or other forms of lung cancer. The estate of Thomas Wells filed a wrongful death lawsuit against BNSF in 2021. Wells — who worked in the Libby area between 1976 and 1978 for the US Forest service — was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a rare and aggressive lung cancer linked to asbestos exposure, at age 65, according to Scripps News. “I’m in great pain and alls I see is this getting worse,” the retired middle school teacher from Oregon said in a video deposition from a hospital bed in his home recorded in March 2020, four months after his cancer diagnosis.  He died a day later. The video of Wells’ final words was played for jurors. Another plaintiff, the family of Joyce Walder, played in the same area in her youth before dying of mesothelioma at 66 — less than a month after her diagnosis — Scripps reported. “I hope no one has to see the light of hope pass from a parent’s or loved one’s eyes, because that is something you will never forget,” Walder’s daughter, Chandra Zechmeister, testified Monday, per Scripps. Representatives for BNSF declined to comment on pending litigation. Also at the center of the proceedings is W.R. Grace & Co., a chemical company that operated a mountaintop vermiculite mine mere miles outside of Libby up until its closure in 1990, according to Fortune. The Maryland-based company has already paid significant settlements to victims, plus a $34 million bankruptcy settlement in 2007 to cover cleanup costs at 32 Superfund sites across the US. The EPA’s Superfund program allows the federal agency to clean up contaminated sites.  The agency descended on Libby in 1999 following news reports of a dusty rail yard. In 2009, it declared in Libby the nation’s first ever public health emergency under the federal Superfund cleanup program, Fortune reported. The pollution in Libby has since been cleaned up — but largely at the public’s expense.  Throughout the trial thus far, US District Court Judge Brian Morris has frequently reminded jurors that W.R. Grace’s liability is separate to that of BNSF, per Fortune. W. R. Grace executives have already faced criminal charges over the contamination at the small Montana town near the US-Canada border, though they were acquitted following a 2009 trial. BNSF has argued that it was obliged under law to ship the vermiculite — which it used in insulation and for other commercial purposes — and that W.R. Grace hadn’t been forthcoming about its asbestos contamination, according to Fortune. Former railroad workers said during testimony and in depositions that they didn’t even know about the health hazards associated with asbestos exposure. Advertisement"

    "content": "Don’t get defensive and burn bridges when you talk about your commission and recent settlements. Jimmy Burgess shares talking points to educate seller clients and the public about the state of your business. Inman Connect At Inman Connect Las Vegas, July 30-Aug. 1, 2024, the noise and misinformation will be banished, all your big questions will be answered, and new business opportunities will be revealed. Join us. If you’re unsure how to answer questions about the National Association of Realtors (NAR) settlement, you’re not alone. The lack of clarity leads many agents to a lack of confidence. A lack of confidence leads to worry, fear and less business. This article shares a few ways to answer common questions with clarity and confidence based on current information. Before I get into the ideas on how to answer these questions, always keep in mind that you should adapt the answers to your own tone and comfort level. The more you can answer these questions with boldness, certainty and in your own voice, the more business you will attract. This is a general question, and you may have been asked a version of this question in a different way. Many of the questions asked and many of the beliefs the public have are unfounded and not based on facts. Again, our tone and attitude should remain calm and confident when answering questions. The first step is to gain clarity on exactly what they are asking. This is an example of how to better understand what they are asking. I’m glad you asked me that question because there is a lot of misinformation out there. If you don’t mind, what have you heard? Once they tell you what they’ve heard, you can begin to answer their question specifically. However, this is a framework for a way to answer these types of questions by building rapport rather than being confrontational. First off, let me clarify that the settlement by the National Association of Realtors is proposed and still to be approved, declined or modified by the court before it moves forward and changes are made. But let me start by telling you what I love about this proposed settlement. No. 1 is that I love the additional transparency it brings to the process. I have always believed the more a consumer is informed, the better decisions they can make for themselves. So I love that the commission will be out in the open so that everyone involved in the transaction is informed. The second thing I love about this proposed settlement is that it forces agents to be able to communicate their value to buyers in a way that they have not needed to do in the past. This will act as a separation opportunity for professional agents like me who can clearly communicate and show the value they bring to their clients versus the less-than-professional agents. In other words, this proposal will lead to buyers choosing better agents and better agents lead to smoother transactions for everyone involved. As I mentioned earlier, it is just a proposed settlement at this point but let me explain to you the two main points that we anticipate will not change. The first is that buyer’s agent compensation will no longer be able to be provided on the MLS. The proposal does not say that a seller cannot provide buyer’s agent compensation; it simply means that it will no longer be able to be displayed or communicated through the MLS. Although sellers have always had the ability to negotiate the amount of compensation they offer buyer’s agents, I anticipate many sellers will continue to offer buyer’s agent commissions due to the competitive disadvantage it may put them in compared to other homes for sale in many cases. We will know more about how this looks exactly when and if the proposed settlement is approved by the court, which is estimated to be this July as of now. NAR also agreed to create a new rule requiring MLS participants working with buyers to enter into written agreements with their buyers before the buyer tours properties. Think of this like a seller always signs a listing agreement with an agent before listing their home for sale, so in the same manner, a buyer would sign an agreement with an agent who would represent them in their purchase. There are still several details that need to be worked out, but I anticipate this will be approved in some shape or fashion. The bottom line in all of this is that change is inevitable in every business, and these are a few of the changes happening in our business. Sometimes, the tone and attitude you use when answering questions determines the outcome as much as the words you say. Many agents become defensive or even confrontational when this question is posed. Very few people want to work with someone who is defensive or confrontational. The best way to build a relationship and a prospect’s confidence is to show respect and provide them with facts. This is an example of how to do so. That is a great question, and I am glad you asked it. There is a lot of misinformation out there so I am happy to be able to give you the facts so you can make the best decision for you and your family. The next step is to provide facts in a way that provides them with options. People with options respond with less emotion. Commission has always been negotiable, and you can pay no commission on either side by selling your home For Sale By Owner just as you always have been able to in the past. But let me give you a few reasons to consider why offering a buyer’s side commission might position you to sell your home at a higher price, in less time and with less hassle. The first factor to consider is your positioning in the market. The key to selling a home at the highest price possible is garnering as much interest as possible from as many people as possible. If there are multiple homes for sale in your neighborhood, with the others offering buyer’s side compensation and you not offering any, you may be putting yourself at a positional disadvantage with buyer’s agents and buyers. Think of it as a buyer. If your agent told you that a home does not offer a buyer’s side commission and that you would have to pay the agent’s commission on top of the other closing costs, would you be more or less likely to want to see the home? That is the position the buyers will be in. Many buyers will choose to either not see your home or expect a lower price if they will be responsible for the commission. Right or wrong, these factors can limit the pool of potential buyers that see your home, which can challenge our ability to sell your home at the highest price possible, netting you the most money, in the least amount of time. The other option is that the buyer decides to represent themselves without an agent saving you the buyer’s side commission. There will always be a portion of the market that doesn’t think they need an agent. Please know that some of these buyers will be competent and capable of completing the transaction without an agent, but many will not. Between inspections, escrow deposits, loan documents, timeline deadlines, appraisals, surveys, title work and all the other details needed, it only takes one missed step in the process to create delays to the closing or a late cancellation of the contract due to a miscue that a professional agent could have helped them avoid. These are potential scenarios that can cost you money, delays and frustration that could be worth more than the buyer’s side commission. As I mentioned earlier, the decision is yours. My job is to provide you with the best information possible, so you can make the best decision you can for you and your family. Once you let me know the direction you would like to go, then I have to make the best decision for me and my business as well. John Maxwell said, “Change is inevitable. Growth is optional.” Prepare yourself for these changes now and find a way to not only bring more value to buyers and sellers, but learn how to communicate that value in a way that attracts more of your ideal clients.  There will be winners and losers during this time of change. Choose to adapt with an attitude of service and you will be rewarded.

BNSF Railway attorneys are expected to argue before jurors Friday, April 19, 2024, that the railroad should not be held liable for the lung cancer deaths of two former residents of the asbestos-contaminated Montana town, one of the deadliest sites in the federal Superfund pollution program. (Kurt Wilson/The Missoulian via AP, File)       HELENA, Mont. (AP) — BNSF Railway attorneys told a Montana jury Friday that the railroad should not be held liable for the lung cancer deaths of two former residents of an asbestos-contaminated Montana town, one of the deadliest sites in the federal Superfund pollution program. Attorneys for the company say the corporate predecessors of the railroad, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, didn’t know the vermiculite they hauled over decades from a nearby mine was filled with hazardous microscopic asbestos fibers or that asbestos was dangerous. BNSF attorney Chad Knight said the railroad could only be held liable if it could have foreseen the health hazards of asbestos based on information available decades ago when the alleged exposures happened. “In the 50s, 60s and 70s no one in the public suspected there might be health concerns,” Knight said. The case in federal civil court is the first of numerous lawsuits against the Texas-based railroad corporation to reach trial over its past operations in Libby, Montana. Current and former residents of the small town near the U.S.-Canada border want BNSF held accountable for its alleged role in asbestos exposure that health officials say has killed several hundred people and sickened thousands. The seven-member jury met briefly Friday and planned to resume deliberations on Monday morning. They were instructed to decide if the railroad was at fault in the deaths and if so, the amount of damages to award to their estates. If the jurors find that the railroad should also face punitive damages, a separate hearing would determine that amount. \n Looming over the proceedings is W.R. Grace & Co., a chemical company that operated a mountaintop vermiculite mine 7 miles (11 kilometers) outside of Libby until it was closed 1990. The Maryland-based company played a central role in Libby’s tragedy and has paid significant settlements to victims. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris has referred to the the chemical company as “the elephant in the room” in the BNSF trial. He reminded jurors several times that the case was about the railroad’s conduct, not W.R. Grace’s separate liability.  How much W.R. Grace revealed about the asbestos dangers to Texas-based BNSF and its corporate predecessors has been sharply disputed. The plaintiffs argued that railroad higher-ups were aware, but that workers on the ground in Libby were left out of the loop. “We’re here to make a party that accepts zero responsibility accept an appropriate amount of responsibility,” plaintiffs’ attorney Mark Lanier said. “This is the fault of the bigwigs in the corporate office.” The judge instructed the jury it could only find the railroad negligent based on its actions in the Libby Railyard, not for hauling the vermiculite. The railroad said it was obliged under law to ship the vermiculite, which was used in insulation and for other commercial purposes. It said W.R. Grace employees had concealed the health hazards from the railroad. Former railroad workers said during testimony and in depositions that they knew nothing about the risks of asbestos. They said Grace employees were responsible for loading the hopper cars, plugging the holes of any cars leaking vermiculite and occasionally cleaned up material that spilled in the rail yard. The estates of the two deceased plaintiffs have argued that the W.R. Grace’s actions don’t absolve BNSF of its responsibility for failing to clean up the vermiculite that spilled in the railyard in the heart of the community. Their attorneys said BNSF should have known about the dangers because Grace put signs on rail cars carrying vermiculite warning of potential health risks. They showed jurors an image of a warning label allegedly attached to rail cars in the late 1970s that advised against inhaling the asbestos dust because it could cause bodily harm. Family members of Tom Wells and Joyce Walder testified that their lives ended soon after they were diagnosed with mesothelioma. The families said the dust blowing from the rail yard sickened and killed them. In a March 2020 video of Wells played for jurors and recorded the day before he died, he lay in a home hospital bed, struggling to breathe. “I’ve been placed in a horrible spot here, and the best chance I see at release — relief for everybody — is to just get it over with,” he said. “It’s just not something I want to try and play hero through because I don’t think that there’s a miracle waiting.” The Environmental Protection Agency descended on Libby after the 1999 news reports. In 2009 it declared in Libby the nation’s first ever public health emergency under the federal Superfund cleanup program. The pollution in Libby has been cleaned up, largely at public expense. Yet the long timeframe over which asbestos-related diseases develop means people previously exposed are likely to continue getting sick for years to come, health officials say.

    "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\tS halvingem nastal skok ve výši poplatků za platbu bitcoinem.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t• Zdroj: DALL-E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Největší kryptoměna prodělala dlouho očekávané půlení (halving), které zeslabilo příliv nových virtuálních mincí na trh. S kurzem bitcoinu ale dlouho očekávaná událost o půlden později prakticky nehnula. To se nedá říct o poplatcích za bitcoinové transakce, které brutálně zdražily. Kdo by chtěl poslat bitcoin přes jeho základní vrstvu a dočkat se potvrzení platby v řádu minut, jen na transakčním poplatku by nyní zaplatil klidně i přes dvacet dolarů. Přitom ještě přede dvěma týdny nebyl problém s rychlým potvrzením tohoto způsobu platby při uhrazení o řád nižšího poplatku. Důvodem jejich zdražení je souběžně s halvingem naplánovaný start nového bitcoinového protokolu Runes, který umí využít technologické základy nejrozšířenější kryptoměny k vytváření alternativních virtuálních mincí. Ty obvykle nedoprovází žádný komplikovaný záměr, ale snaha rychle vydělat. Díky novosti, tedy i titěrné tržní kapitalizaci těchto „mincí“ mnohdy stačí jen nepatrný záblesk zájmu spekulantů k násobnému vyhnání jejich ceny. Generování těchto alternativních kryptoměn ale bitcoinovou síť zahlcuje, což zdražuje její používání například pro platby největší digitální měnou. Zatímco halving je základní součástí fungování bitcoinu od jeho vzniku, navěšování funkcí typu Runes je novou iniciativou, kdy si část programátorů zkouší, co všechno bitcoinová technologie zvládne. „Představa, že zájem o Runes v brzké době kompletně vymizí, je ale stejně naivní, jako že lidé přestanou utrácet v kasinech a hrát automaty. Snahy o rychlé a jednoduché zbohatnutí formou spekulace máme prostě v DNA,“ napsal na sociální síti X autor knihy Platby budoucnosti Michal Novák. „Časem se to zchladí a bude to jeden z dalších způsobů pro spekulaci,“ uklidňuje popularizátor používání bitcoinu k placení. Skok ve výši transakčních poplatků je zatím nejvýraznějším dopadem události jménem halving. Ta podle již daných pravidel fungování nejstarší kryptoměny ve zhruba čtyřletých intervalech snižuje na polovinu počet bitcoinů, které za den vzniknou. Po sobotním půlení toto množství kleslo z 900 na 450. Smyslem těchto pravidel je zajištění toho, aby všechny bitcoiny nešly do oběhu naráz, ale vznikaly postupně v horizontu zhruba 130 let. Nikdy jich nemá existovat více než 21 milionů. V dosavadní patnáctileté historii bitcoinu dosud vždy po halvingu s určitým odstupem následoval prudký růst ceny kryptoměny. Ten lidé z oboru očekávají i nyní, kdy se kurz bitcoinu drží nad 60 tisíci dolary.  „Domnívám se ale, že efekt halvingu – i kdyby už neměl být tak explozivní jako v minulých letech – se opět projeví zhruba se šestiměsíčním zpožděním. Na ceně bitcoinu se tedy pozitivně projeví až koncem roku,“ uvedl v nedávném rozhovoru pro e15 zakladatel kryptofondu RockawayX Viktor Fischer, podle kterého je reálné, že bitcoin nakonec zdolá i hranici 100 tisíc dolarů. V mezičase ale mohou přijít o iluze všichni, kdo si spojovali halving s okamžitým cenovým skokem. Podle manažera největší globální kryptoburzy Binance pro Česko a Slovensko Ondřeje Pilného lze teď spíše očekávat krátkodobé ochlazení trhu. „Na cenu bitcoinu má půlení spíše dlouhodobý efekt,“ dodává Pilný. Zakladatel české burzy virtuálních měn Coinmate Roman Valihrach doplňuje, že v minulých letech bitcoin zaznamenal i třicetiprocentní propady ceny. „Je klidně možné, že takové přijdou i letos. Dokud se ale cena bitcoinu v příštích měsících udrží nad 51 tisíci dolary, zůstanu zcela v klidu a budu nadále věřit v další růst. Kdyby šla cena stále jen nahoru, trh by se velmi rychle přehřál a nikdy bychom se nedostali tak vysoko, jako když cyklus trvá déle.“ Podle některých analytiků je možný i dočasný propad bitcoinu dokonce hluboko pod 50 tisíc dolarů. Agentura Bloomberg již dříve citovala predikci banky JPMorgan, podle které by po opadnutí pozitivních očekávání spjatých s halvingem mohla kryptoměna sestoupit až na 42 tisíc dolarů. Předpokladem je, že halving tvrdě zasáhne byznys s těžbou bitcoinu a mnoho minerů bude nuceno ukončit své podnikání a rozprodávat zásoby natěžených bitcoinů. Takový scénář ale momentálně nevypadá nejrealističtěji, přestože těžba kryptoměny s halvingem zásadně souvisí. Nové bitcoiny formálně vznikají jako odměna těžařům za to, že se svou aktivitou podílejí na potvrzování transakcí. Tato odměna s půlením, jak název napovídá, sice nyní klesla na polovinu, ale mineři mají kromě inkasování nově vytvořených bitcoinů ještě jiný zdroj příjmů. Tím je vybírání transakčních poplatků, které jsou díky současnému zahlcení sítě abnormálně vysoké. Kryptoměna bitcoin se dostala do oběhu 3. ledna 2009. Během patnácti let existence zaujala nejen vývojem svého kurzu, ale i tím, jaké reakce vzbudila mezi známými podnikateli, investory nebo politiky. Následuje chronologicky řazený výčet silných výroků o nejstarší virtuální měně. „Pokud tomu nevěříš nebo nerozumíš, nemám čas tě přesvědčovat, sorry.“ Reakce dodnes neznámého tvůrce bitcoinu Satoshiho Nakamota, když na diskuzním fóru popisoval technické parametry kryptoměny. „Od peněžního systému chceme, aby zprostředkovával transakce a aby díky tomu rostlo hospodářství jako celek. V případě bitcoinu se ale nic takového neděje. Na něm bohatnou ti, kteří ho mají dostatek a neutrácejí.“ Lauerát Nobelovy ceny za ekonomii Paul Krugman. „Držte se od bitcoinu dál. Je to v podstatě jen šálení smyslů.“ Šéf Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett se o čtyři roky později zmínil o bitcoinu znovu kriticky. Vyjádřil přesvědčení, že virtuální měna špatně skončí, a přirovnal ji k jedu na krysy. Výrok šéfa hnutí ANO a jednoho z nejbohatších obyvatel Česka zdobil i jednu ze zdí v pražských Holešovicích.|archiv E15 „Vůbec netuším, co to je, a pokud vím, tak nikdo bitcoinem neplatí. Ta měna nemá nějakou dobrou pověst.\" Andrej Babiš v roli ministra financí takto komentoval zprávu, že kryptoměnu bylo možné koupit i na pobočkách České pošty. „Bitcoin je ukazatelem toho, jak velká je ve světě poptávka po praní špinavých peněz.“ Larry Fink, šéf společnosti BlackRock, která je největším správcem aktiv na světě. V roce 2023 ale svůj názor změnil. Právě jeho firma se začala připravovat na spuštění prvního bitcoinového burzovně-obchodovaného fondu (ETF). Růst kurzu bitcoinu na podzim 2023 navíc glosoval slovy, že jde o přesun investorů za kvalitou, a tou kvalitou je podle Finka právě dominantní kryptoměna. „Bitcoin je příklad investice, na který sedí teorie většího hlupáka. Sama o sobě kryptoměna nic neprodukuje. Kdybych si teď mohl vsadit na její pokles, udělám to.“ Zakladatel Microsoftu Bill Gates, později, v roce 2022, na téma kryptoměn dodal, že kdo má méně peněz než Elon Musk, neměl by bitcoin vůbec kupovat. „V době, kdy na standardní měně máte úroky pod úrovní inflace, jenom blázen by se nedíval po alternativách. Konkrétně bitcoin je skoro stejný bullshit jako ty běžné peníze. Klíčové slovo je ,skoro’“. Elon Musk, šéf Tesly a SpaceX, jehož firmy drží bitcoiny ve své rozvaze.  „Když zahrabete zlato na zahradě, bude to stále zlato i za tisíce let. Ale když o bitcoin přestanou mít zájem těžaři, ztratí na hodnotě. Je to zranitelné aktivum.“ Nassim Nicholas Taleb na investiční konferenci SH!FTS.|e15 Michaela Szkanderová „Já céčka kupovat nechci.“ Na stejné konferenci jako Taleb se kriticky vůči kryptoměnám jako takovým vymezil šéf EPH a spolumajitel vydavatele deníku e15 Daniel Křetínský.|E15 Michaela Szkanderová "

    "title": "Nobel laureate Esther Duflo proposes taxing 3,000 billionaires to protect the world’s poorest from climate change—and most Americans likely agree with the plan",
    "description": "The proposal is meant to hold billionaires tax-accountable–and use the money to help the poorest people survive climate change.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-20T12:19:00Z",
    "content": "The world’s rich nations have agreed, several times, that helping poor countries cope with the fallout from climate change is a priority — but so far they’ve failed to put their money where their mouth is, raising a fraction of one percent of the money they’ve pledged for this task. To solve this dilemma, Nobel laureate Esther Duflo has a proposal: Tax 3,000 of the world’s richest people to ensure the poorest can survive the climate-changed future.  Duflo presented the proposal this week at the most recent Group of 20 nations meeting held in Washington, D.C. The 2019 Nobel laureate in economics has a very straightforward goal in mind, she told Fortune: generate enough public funding to protect the world’s poorest citizens dying from climate change. “That is our moral debt,” Duflo told Fortune. “It’s much more money than the international community, and rich countries, have been able to commit towards poor countries for any form of climate action.”  The plan involves a global 15% minimum tax on the profits of large multinational companies, which was approved by the G20 in 2021, as well as a global 2% income tax on billionaires, which was proposed to the G20 for the first time in February by Brazil.  The idea is not to tax the ultra-rich more, Duflo said, but rather to ensure that they are paying income taxes in general—since notoriously, this group avoids a lot of taxation. And once their fair share of taxes are collected, she argued, “what better use of them than to compensate the very poorest people in the world for losing their life due to climate change?” Duflo’s two-prong proposal argues that rich nations owe a “moral debt,” since they have historically released the most greenhouse gas emissions, while poor countries, which emit very little, suffer disproportionately from the most harmful disasters exacerbated by climate change. Duflo calculated that moral debt to be about $518 billion per year—based on the impact that a ton of carbon has on the climate, the effect rising temperatures have on likelihood of death, and the roughly $7 million statistical value of a human life as determined by the Environmental Protection Agency.  “We owe this money to the poor citizens of the world,” Duflo argued. While parts of this plan have previously been suggested by economists, the newest elements are “to calculate how much we owe, where it could come from, and how it would be spent,” she told Fortune. The moral debt, she noted, is based on current environmental damage calculations and would decrease if global greenhouse gas emissions are lowered. In her view, collecting income tax from the wealthiest individuals who often avoid paying taxes through complex financial maneuvering is a way to raise public funds “from sources where it wouldn’t be very painful,” she said. It “rather seems like a very reasonable place to find money.” Duflo isn’t alone in that opinion–69% of people in the U.S and 84% of people in Europe support a global tax on millionaires, according to research by the French Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, and about 55% of people in the U.S support sharing half of the global tax with low income countries.  According to Duflo’s proposal, the two tax programs would generate about $400 billion each year in public funding to mitigate the climate change disasters, like heat waves, floods, droughts, and intense storms, that people in poor countries face much more severely than those in developed countries.  The first part of the program was approved by the G20 in October 2021, when 137 countries and jurisdictions agreed to a 15% global minimum tax on the profits of large multinational companies. If each company complies, the taxes would generate an extra $205 billion per year, according to estimates by the European Union Tax Observatory. As of this January, about 40 countries have implemented that tax, including the nations in the European Union, Japan, Greece and Italy. The second tax program, a proposed 2% income tax on billionaires, was proposed by Brazil’s Finance Minister Fernando Haddad in February. France’s Minister of Finance Bruno Le Maire endorsed it, saying the G20 should aim to reach an agreement on the billionaire tax by 2027, Reuters reported.  And in fact, many wealthy people, like Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet, have endorsed the logic behind the proposal for years. Buffett famously stated he pays less in taxes than his secretary, despite his colossal estimated net worth of about $136 billion. The wealthy, Duflo said, “should be taxed proportionately at the same level as anybody else on their income, which is not the case today.”  The 2% is a total—not in addition to any income tax the wealthy are already paying. For example, if a billionaire is currently paying a 1% income tax rate, they would only pay an additional 1% under Duflo’s plan. The plan would raise an additional $250 billion per year, and along with the corporate global tax, the total raised would approach $500 billion, the amount of “moral debt” Duflo calculated. As for where the money would go, Duflo suggested direct cash transfers to individuals, city and state authorities. She believes this fund should be separate from “investments in renewable energy,” because there is growing importance for a fund that “is of everybody’s benefit,” and not just those with access to green technology. With app-based banking now widespread, she said, it’s relatively easy for people to access cash  even in remote or poverty-stricken areas of the world, like Northern India, Bangladesh, and Africa. Aside from the usefulness of cash in a time of crisis — allowing people to temporarily relocate, take time off work or move a herd of animals during a weather disaster — growing research suggests direct cash transfers are an increasingly effective way to end extreme poverty. A 2016 Oxford study found direct cash transfers can significantly improve health, economic outcomes and psychological well-being, and also helps people access resources for safety during climate-related disasters. Technology that predicts floods, droughts, heatwaves, and other natural disasters could even be used to automate direct cash transfers to the people most vulnerable, Duflo added.   Duflo’s proposal is one of the biggest climate relief funding packages ever proposed at the global level, and the next steps for the proposal will be picked up at a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in Rio de Janeiro in July. The G20 members represent around 85% of the global GDP, over 75% of the global trade, and about two-thirds of the world population. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

With Buffett’s track record of success and his reputation as the Oracle of Omaha, analyzing Berkshire’s holdings offers valuable lessons and potential opportunities for investors.

Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity. Apple (AAPL) Bank of America (BAC) American Express (AXP) Coca-Cola (KO) Chevron (CVX) Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Kraft Heinz (KHC) Moody’s (MCO) Warren Buffett and the late Charlie Munger believed that diversification is necessary only if you don’t know what you’re doing. “[Diversification] makes very little sense for those who know what they’re doing,” says Buffet. The above eight core investment picks demonstrate Buffet’s philosophy of concentrated investing in recognizable brands and resilient business models. Apple, with its innovative products and unrivaled brand loyalty, holds the largest share of Berkshire’s investments. Its dominance in the technology sector aligns with Buffett’s preference for companies with wide economic dominance. Additionally, other popular companies like Coca-Cola and American Express have been pillars in Berkshire’s holdings for decades. Their consistent performance and entrenched market positions demonstrate Buffett’s fondness for long-term value creation. Buffett’s positions on energy stocks Chevron and Occidental Petroleum highlight his forward-thinking approach to market trends. Considering energy’s relative insignificance in its portfolio historically, these investments reflect Berkshire’s expectation for the spot price of crude oil to remain inflated.

    "title": "BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wants to solve the retirement crisis and has an important message for future retirees",
    "description": "A secure retirement is less attainable now than it was 30 years ago, says the billionaire.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-21T10:32:00Z",
    "content": "As sage billionaires go, BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink belongs in the same rarefied air as Warren Buffett. And while he probably stopped worrying about his own nest egg a long time ago, Fink remains concerned for those retirees who do, or don't realize they should. Because for him, it’s personal. These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord. Here's how 'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling rising costs — take advantage today In his 2024 annual letter to shareholders, Fink recalled going through his parents' finances after his mother passed away and his father started to decline. He surmised that they never made more than a combined $150,000 a year in today's dollars. Yet was shocked that their retirement savings \"was an order of magnitude bigger” than someone would expect for a couple with their income. “And when we finished going over their estate, we learned why: My parents' investments,” he wrote. The experience reminded him that BlackRock was started \"because we believed participating in those markets was going to be crucial for people who wanted to retire comfortably and financially secure.\" In a March interview with Bloomberg, Fink addressed the financial challenges that keep Americans from retiring with dignity, which revolve around the overreliance on Social Security and the failure to save for investing. \"Social Security is a fantastic foundation for retirement,\" Fink said. \"But if that's all you have when you retire, you're going to be living below the poverty line. It's supplemental but it's not meant to be the totality of what you have in retirement.\" While there’s no consensus on how much money you need to retire (and everyone’s situation is different), one yardstick is the 80% Rule, where you plan to spend 80% of your pre-retirement income per year. Assuming you retire from a job with a $100,000 annual salary, Social Security won’t come close to cutting it. Read more: Suze Orman says Americans are poorer than they think — but having a dream retirement is so much easier when you know these 3 simple money moves The current average monthly benefit for retirees is $1,907, or just under $23,000 a year, according to the Social Security Administration. The shortfall? More than $57,000. The maximum benefit for an individual retiring at age 70 in 2024 is $4,873 per month or $58,476 a year. Fink also noted in the Bloomberg interview that our current retirement system “was based on statistics created 50 years ago” when the average life expectancy was below 70. Today’s statistics show that with a couple in good health, “one of them’s going to live over 90.” Breakthroughs in treating dementia, heart disease and obesity have extended life spans, he pointed out. While marveling at these “miracles of medicine,” as he calls them, Fink lamented: \"There is not a dialogue in America or most places about, 'Can we afford that longevity?'\" Unless Congress takes action to shore up the system, Social Security will not be able to keep paying all promised benefits beyond 2033. Benefits are expected to be cut by around 20% starting in 2034. \"We need to really educate our citizens about the need for savings,\" said Fink — though not via vanilla bank accounts. Investing, he stressed, allows people to take advantage of capital markets and compounding. While adding to your portfolio, do a cursory examination of your outflow (expenses) and inflow (bringing in extra funds). The best cuts and side hustles are the most painless. Imagine selling off your expensive SUV and renting out the now-empty garage or parking space on the same weekend – then putting the money into your IRA or 401(k). Some of the simplest and best investment advice comes from another shareholder letter – this one from Buffett in 2013 to Berkshire Hathaway investors. On his passing and on behalf of his wife, “My advice to the trustee could not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund.” In the end, how much you get to live on in your retirement determines how you get to live. “My parents lived their final years with dignity and financial freedom,” Fink wrote. “Most people don’t have that chance. But they can.” Jeff Bezos told his siblings to invest $10K in his startup called Amazon, and now their stake is worth over $1B — 3 ways to get rich without having to gamble on risky public stocks Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But 5 minutes could have you paying as little as $29/month Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead.

    "title": "Wealth creation: 25 key money lessons you should follow to make it big in fiscal 2025",
    "description": "The long-term goals could be to buy a house, children’s education, or save for retirement. These goals are non-negotiable. Do not compromise on these goals regardless of the temptation to spend or invest for a short-term goal.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-21T06:57:53Z",
    "content": "      Just like in any financial year, most of you would be nurturing big-money goals for fiscal 2025 as well. Wealth advisors, meanwhile, often point out that your short-term goals should align with the long-term ones.     As a result, you should stay true to wealth creation instead of getting carried away with the flow. Here, we list out some of the key money lessons that each investor should be mindful of. In fiscal 2025, you may want to follow these money lessons to achieve your financial goals in the long term.     Doyens of investing such as Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham, Charlie Munger, Morgan Housel and Ray Dalio recommended these lessons in different fora and platforms.      Also Read | Amid a flurry of deep fake videos by top bosses of NSE and BSE, how can investors stay cautious and safe  Money lessons you should follow for long-term wealth creation1. Stay away from Mr Market: The price quoted by Mr Market has no relevance if you don’t intend to sell your securities. It’s pointless to see the price every day unless you intend to buy or sell a stock that day.  Mr Market is an allegory coined by legendary investor and author of ‘The Intelligent Investor’ Benjamin Graham to describe irrational or contradictory traits of the stock market.    2. Stay true to long-term goals: The long-term goals could be to buy a house, or children’s education, or save for retirement. These goals are non-negotiable. Do not compromise on these goals regardless of the temptation to spend or invest for a short-term goal.     3. Wealth generation is the key: Earning dividends from shares is a bonus of sorts. And little stock appreciation is exciting. But the key objective of investing is, or should be, to generate wealth which can happen primarily via equity investment.     4. Investing is not for the faint-hearted: Markets are meant to be volatile. So, when the market surges or crashes, you should not redeem. Be strong and don’t lose heart.    5. Continue your SIPs during market decline: Instead of buying more during a bear phase, investors tend to stop their SIPs believing that the market is not right for investing. Whereas the phenomenon of ‘rupee cost averaging’ says that investors should invest across different price points to get a fair average price and to maximise the chance of earning a higher profit.      6. Importance of portfolio: The ideal ratio between equity and debt is 70-30 in ideal circumstances. So, you should invest 70 percent of your portfolio in equity while the rest in fixed-income instruments such as fixed deposits (FDs) and bonds. But when equity prices rise, it is vital to redeem some of the equity assets to redeploy some of the funds in debt so that the debt-equity ratio remains the same.    7. Everything is just an event for investors: In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, leaving markets jittery around the world. Oil prices jumped in its aftermath. Before that in January Jan 2021, rioters entered the US Capitol in what was referred to as the United States Capitol attack. Then Israel attacked Hamas in Gaza in October 2023. This and many more domestic and international events did impact financial markets significantly. And currently, Lok Sabha polls are believed to leave their footprint on stock markets.    Each time something significant happens, observers call the event a ‘watershed’ or pathbreaking, but in the long term, each event is part and parcel of the ongoing market cycle. The key is to remain invested in wealth creation and cut the noise.      Also Read | Financial planning pitfalls: 10 mistakes that derail your dream    8. Buy right and sit tight: It is advisable to exercise as much caution as you want before deciding to invest in a stock or fund. After examining the stock, if your analysis suggests that this is the right investment for you, then buy it and sit tight afterwards. Do not get worried about small provocations after you have purchased the ‘right’ stock    9. Don’t put round pegs in square holes: There is no one-size-fits-all approach to investing. Something that works for young investors may not work for middle-aged investors who are supposed to be slightly more risk-averse; further what may work for the middle-aged investor may not work for someone close to retirement. So, the dynamics of equity-debt ratio and risk-return analysis alter based on individual investor's risk appetite and age of investor.     10. Engage an expert or advisor: Although some basic investing principles can be learnt and implemented by investors themselves. But when things become slightly complex and involve higher stakes, it is always advisable to rope in some expert. One should not have any qualms about engaging an investment expert or wealth advisor.      Also Read | Lok Sabha Elections 2024: How will they impact financial markets and what should investors do?    11. Each asset class has its unique value proposition: Investors tend to view one asset class in its entirety whereas each has its advantages and disadvantages. For instance, no matter how good it is to invest in equity for long-term wealth creation, it can’t replace debt and fixed-income instruments or precious metals. And vice versa is also true. So, it is recommended to see different asset classes holistically and not in isolation.     12. Investing or gambling: Remember that investing in some categories such as derivatives or cryptocurrencies is so risky that it is not very different from gambling. It is far different from long-term investing based on a stock’s potential.    13. Diversify: It is good to diversify across asset classes, sectors and market cap. Diversification should be done at every level. Not only should one diversify between asset classes but also across sectors and market capitalisation i.e., large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap.     14. Acceptance of loss is key to good investing: Paraphrasing psychologist Daniel Kahneman, the pain of losing one rupee is often more painful than the joy of earning one rupee. This leads to a lot of bad decision-making by investors. For example, when they lose some money because of a wrong investing call, they want to correct the mistake by hanging on to it instead of exiting the stock and settling for a lesser loss.

Knowledge of investments versus mental strength: Knowledge about investments and money is important but even more important than this are mental strength, tolerance, patience and other ‘soft skills’. These characteristics play a key role in an investor’s investing journey.     16. Efficient markets hypothesis: Efficient markets exist only in textbooks, Warren Buffett once remarked. Stocks usually trade at foolish prices, both high and low. In reality, marketable stocks and bonds are unnerving. So, it is wrong to believe that the markets correct themselves — as suggested by the efficient market hypothesis — on their own to reflect their true value.    17. Good stocks are not easily available: Warren Buffett once talked about the uniqueness of good businesses when he highlighted that Berkshire Hathaway could choose only 12 good businesses in its operations of 60 years. i.e., on average only once in five years.     18. Misleading short-term returns: Media headlines quarter-by-quarter returns are hugely misleading and can misinform investors. Some stocks may appear battered based on the news of the day, but they may still enjoy financial moat (e.g. impressive cash flow or a patent) and can be a good \"investable\" business when seen from the lens of long-term investing.     Also Read | Baby Reindeer on Netflix: Unveiling the hidden money lessons every viewer needs    19. Power of compounding: It can’t be emphasised enough that compounding is the key to long-term wealth generation. Warren Buffett’s letter points out that Berkshire's journey grew faster after 1967. For the astronomical rise of Berkshire Hathaway, he points out there are four key reasons: continued savings by investors, power of compounding, avoidance of major mistakes, and the American Tailwind.    20. Leverage is risky: Charlie Munger once pointed out that leverage is dangerous because there is no such thing as a 100 percent sure thing in investing. This means even after earning high returns when investment falls, it can lead to the undoing of past gains.    21. Building independent opinions: It is vital to build your opinions about various things in investing,  according to Ray Dalio. Only following the grapevine and what is being promoted can't hold you in good stead.     22. Investing in sectors you know: Dalio also believes that investing is risky regardless of which sectors you choose. One of the easiest ways to make investing less risky is to opt for the sectors that you are well acquainted with.       23. Prevent bad decisions: It is as important to prevent bad decisions as it is to take the right ones. Be modest and give importance to the protection of capital. One should be prepared for unknown events, and make plans accordingly. You should not only prepare for what is likely to happen but also what may happen.    Also Read | Crew: 3 important money lessons from this Tabu, Kareena and Kriti starrer    24. Luck plays its role: Morgan Housel, author of ‘Psychology of Money’ believes that luck and risk are siblings. It is a reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than just individual effort. He quotes Scott Galloway, a New York University academic, to say, “Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.\" Housel explains that luck and risk are so similar that you can’t believe in one without equally respecting the other.    25.  Use money to buy time: Money is useful when you can use it to buy time and do what you want to do if you are rich in the real sense. Some people may appear rich but only because of the assets bought with a loan. In the real sense of the word, they are not wealthy, Mr Housel wrote in his book ‘The Psychology of Money’. This is because these assets signify debt. Real wealth is an accumulation of income that is not spent and not something on which you are supposed to pay regular interest, and which is supposed to be returned. \nMilestone Alert!\nLivemint tops charts as the fastest growing news website in the world 🌏 Click here  to know more.\n\n Unlock a world of Benefits!

Stay away from Mr Market: The price quoted by Mr Market has no relevance if you don’t intend to sell your securities. It’s pointless to see the price every day unless you intend to buy or sell a stock that day.  Mr Market is an allegory coined by legendary investor and author of ‘The Intelligent Investor’ Benjamin Graham to describe irrational or contradictory traits of the stock market.    2. Stay true to long-term goals: The long-term goals could be to buy a house, or children’s education, or save for retirement. These goals are non-negotiable. Do not compromise on these goals regardless of the temptation to spend or invest for a short-term goal.     3. Wealth generation is the key: Earning dividends from shares is a bonus of sorts. And little stock appreciation is exciting. But the key objective of investing is, or should be, to generate wealth which can happen primarily via equity investment.     4. Investing is not for the faint-hearted: Markets are meant to be volatile. So, when the market surges or crashes, you should not redeem. Be strong and don’t lose heart.    5. Continue your SIPs during market decline: Instead of buying more during a bear phase, investors tend to stop their SIPs believing that the market is not right for investing. Whereas the phenomenon of ‘rupee cost averaging’ says that investors should invest across different price points to get a fair average price and to maximise the chance of earning a higher profit.      6. Importance of portfolio: The ideal ratio between equity and debt is 70-30 in ideal circumstances. So, you should invest 70 percent of your portfolio in equity while the rest in fixed-income instruments such as fixed deposits (FDs) and bonds. But when equity prices rise, it is vital to redeem some of the equity assets to redeploy some of the funds in debt so that the debt-equity ratio remains the same.    7. Everything is just an event for investors: In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, leaving markets jittery around the world. Oil prices jumped in its aftermath. Before that in January Jan 2021, rioters entered the US Capitol in what was referred to as the United States Capitol attack. Then Israel attacked Hamas in Gaza in October 2023. This and many more domestic and international events did impact financial markets significantly. And currently, Lok Sabha polls are believed to leave their footprint on stock markets.    Each time something significant happens, observers call the event a ‘watershed’ or pathbreaking, but in the long term, each event is part and parcel of the ongoing market cycle. The key is to remain invested in wealth creation and cut the noise.      Also Read | Financial planning pitfalls: 10 mistakes that derail your dream    8. Buy right and sit tight: It is advisable to exercise as much caution as you want before deciding to invest in a stock or fund. After examining the stock, if your analysis suggests that this is the right investment for you, then buy it and sit tight afterwards. Do not get worried about small provocations after you have purchased the ‘right’ stock    9. Don’t put round pegs in square holes: There is no one-size-fits-all approach to investing. Something that works for young investors may not work for middle-aged investors who are supposed to be slightly more risk-averse; further what may work for the middle-aged investor may not work for someone close to retirement. So, the dynamics of equity-debt ratio and risk-return analysis alter based on individual investor's risk appetite and age of investor.     10. Engage an expert or advisor: Although some basic investing principles can be learnt and implemented by investors themselves. But when things become slightly complex and involve higher stakes, it is always advisable to rope in some expert. One should not have any qualms about engaging an investment expert or wealth advisor.      Also Read | Lok Sabha Elections 2024: How will they impact financial markets and what should investors do?    11. Each asset class has its unique value proposition: Investors tend to view one asset class in its entirety whereas each has its advantages and disadvantages. For instance, no matter how good it is to invest in equity for long-term wealth creation, it can’t replace debt and fixed-income instruments or precious metals. And vice versa is also true. So, it is recommended to see different asset classes holistically and not in isolation.     12. Investing or gambling: Remember that investing in some categories such as derivatives or cryptocurrencies is so risky that it is not very different from gambling. It is far different from long-term investing based on a stock’s potential.    13. Diversify: It is good to diversify across asset classes, sectors and market cap.

    "description": "A federal jury says Warren Buffett’s BNSF Railway contributed to the deaths of two people who were exposed to asbestos decades ago when tainted mining material was shipped through a Montana town where thousands have been sickened",
    "published_at": "2024-04-22T21:18:29Z",
    "content": "A federal jury says BNSF Railway contributed to the deaths of two people who were exposed to asbestos decades ago when tainted mining material was shipped through a Montana town where thousands have been sickened HELENA, Mont. -- A federal jury on Monday said BNSF Railway contributed to the deaths of two people who were exposed to asbestos decades ago when tainted mining material was shipped through a Montana town where thousands have been sickened. The jury awarded $4 million each in compensatory damages to the estates of the two plaintiffs, who died in 2020. Jurors said asbestos-contaminated vermiculite that spilled in the rail yard in the town of Libby, Montana was a substantial factor in the plaintiffs’ illnesses and deaths. Family members of the two victims hugged their attorneys after the verdict was announced. An attorney for the plaintiffs said the ruling brought some accountability, but one family member told The Associated Press that no amount of money would replace her lost sister. “I’d rather have her than all the money in the world,” Judith Hemphill said of her sister, Joyce Walder. The vermiculite from Libby has high concentrations of naturally-occurring asbestos and was used in insulation and for other commercial purposes in homes and businesses across the U.S. After being mined from a mountaintop outside town, it was loaded onto rail cars that sometimes spilled the material in the Libby rail yard. Residents have described piles of vermiculite being stored in the yard and dust from the facility blowing through downtown Libby. The jury did not find that BNSF acted intentionally or with indifference so no punitive damages were awarded. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. acquired BNSF in 2010, two decades after the W.R. Grace & Co. vermiculite mine near Libby shut down and stopped shipping the contaminated mineral. The estates of the two victims argued that the railroad knew the asbestos-tainted vermiculite was dangerous and failed to clean it up. Both lived near the rail yard decades ago and died from mesothelioma, a rare lung cancer linked to asbestos exposure. The pollution in Libby has been cleaned up, largely at public expense. W.R. Grace, which played a central role in the town’s tragedy, filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and paid $1.8 billion into an asbestos trust fund to settle future cases. Yet the long timeframe over which asbestos-related diseases develop means people previously exposed are likely to continue getting sick for years to come, health officials say. The case in federal civil court over the two deaths was the first of numerous lawsuits against the Texas-based railroad corporation to reach trial over its past operations in Libby. Current and former residents of the small town near the U.S.-Canada border want BNSF held accountable, accusing it of playing a role in asbestos exposure that health officials say has killed several hundred people and sickened thousands. “This is good news. This is the first community exposure case that will hold the railroad accountable for what they’ve done,” said Mark Lanier, an attorney for Walder and Hemphill's estates. The railroad was considering whether to appeal, said a BNSF spokesperson, who referred to it as a “very sad case.”  \"They (the jury) had the difficult task of evaluating conduct that occurred more than 50 years ago, before BNSF ever existed,” said Kendall Sloan, the railroad's director of external communications. BNSF attorney Chad Knight told jurors last week the railroad's employees didn’t know the vermiculite was filled with hazardous microscopic asbestos fibers. “In the ‘50s, ’60s and '70s no one in the public suspected there might be health concerns,” Knight said Friday. The railroad’s experts also suggested during the trial that the plaintiffs could have been exposed to asbestos elsewhere. The railroad said it was obliged under law to ship the vermiculite, which was used in insulation and for other commercial purposes, and that W.R. Grace employees had concealed the health hazards from the railroad. U.S. District Judge Brian Morris had instructed the jury it could only find the railroad negligent based on its actions in the Libby Railyard, not for hauling the vermiculite. Former Libby resident Bill Johnston, who followed the trial, said he was glad the victims' estates got a substantial award.  Johnston, 67, recalled playing in piles of vermiculite at the rail yard as a child and helping his father add piles of the material to their home garden, where it was used as a soil amendment. He, his two siblings and their parents have all been diagnosed with asbestos-related diseases, Johnston said Monday. “They didn't do anything intentionally to cause this harm to their body. Other people knew about it and didn't care,” he said of Libby asbestos victims. “What's that worth? It's hard to put a value on that. But when you say you're going to die prematurely or the life you have left is going to be tethered to an oxygen bottle, there should be some value that makes their life easier in the end.” BNSF was formed in 1995 from the merger of Burlington Northern railroad, which operated in Libby for decades, and the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation. Looming over the proceedings was W.R. Grace, which operated the mountaintop vermiculite mine 7 miles (11 kilometers) outside of Libby until it closed in 1990. Morris referred to the chemical company as “the elephant in the room” during the BNSF trial and reminded jurors repeatedly that the case was about the railroad’s conduct, not W.R. Grace’s separate liability.  Federal prosecutors in 2005 indicted W. R. Grace and executives from the company on criminal charges over the contamination in Libby. A jury acquitted them following a 2009 trial. The Environmental Protection Agency descended on Libby after 1999 news reports of illnesses and deaths among mine workers and their families. In 2009 the agency declared in Libby the nation’s first ever public health emergency under the federal Superfund cleanup program. A second trial against the railroad over the death of a Libby resident is scheduled for May in federal court in Missoula. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Grace, which played a central role in the town’s tragedy, filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and paid $1.8 billion into an asbestos trust fund to settle future cases. Yet the long timeframe over which asbestos-related diseases develop means people previously exposed are likely to continue getting sick for years to come, health officials say. The case in federal civil court over the two deaths was the first of numerous lawsuits against the Texas-based railroad corporation to reach trial over its past operations in Libby. Current and former residents of the small town near the U.S.-Canada border want BNSF held accountable, accusing it of playing a role in asbestos exposure that health officials say has killed several hundred people and sickened thousands. “This is good news. This is the first community exposure case that will hold the railroad accountable for what they’ve done,” said Mark Lanier, an attorney for Walder and Hemphill's estates. The railroad was considering whether to appeal, said a BNSF spokesperson, who referred to it as a “very sad case.”  \"They (the jury) had the difficult task of evaluating conduct that occurred more than 50 years ago, before BNSF ever existed,” said Kendall Sloan, the railroad's director of external communications. BNSF attorney Chad Knight told jurors last week the railroad's employees didn’t know the vermiculite was filled with hazardous microscopic asbestos fibers. “In the ‘50s, ’60s and '70s no one in the public suspected there might be health concerns,” Knight said Friday. The railroad’s experts also suggested during the trial that the plaintiffs could have been exposed to asbestos elsewhere. The railroad said it was obliged under law to ship the vermiculite, which was used in insulation and for other commercial purposes, and that W.R. Grace employees had concealed the health hazards from the railroad. U.S. District Judge Brian Morris had instructed the jury it could only find the railroad negligent based on its actions in the Libby Railyard, not for hauling the vermiculite. Former Libby resident Bill Johnston, who followed the trial, said he was glad the victims' estates got a substantial award.  Johnston, 67, recalled playing in piles of vermiculite at the rail yard as a child and helping his father add piles of the material to their home garden, where it was used as a soil amendment. He, his two siblings and their parents have all been diagnosed with asbestos-related diseases, Johnston said Monday. “They didn't do anything intentionally to cause this harm to their body. Other people knew about it and didn't care,” he said of Libby asbestos victims. “What's that worth? It's hard to put a value on that. But when you say you're going to die prematurely or the life you have left is going to be tethered to an oxygen bottle, there should be some value that makes their life easier in the end.” BNSF was formed in 1995 from the merger of Burlington Northern railroad, which operated in Libby for decades, and the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation.

The jury awarded $4 million each in compensatory damages to the estates of the two plaintiffs, who died in 2020. Jurors said asbestos-contaminated vermiculite that spilled in the rail yard in the town of Libby, Montana was a substantial factor in the plaintiffs’ illnesses and deaths. Family members of the two victims hugged their attorneys after the verdict was announced. An attorney for the plaintiffs said the ruling brought some accountability, but one family member told The Associated Press that no amount of money would replace her lost sister. “I’d rather have her than all the money in the world,” Judith Hemphill said of her sister, Joyce Walder. The vermiculite from Libby has high concentrations of naturally-occurring asbestos and was used in insulation and for other commercial purposes in homes and businesses across the U.S. After being mined from a mountaintop outside town, it was loaded onto rail cars that sometimes spilled the material in the Libby rail yard. Residents have described piles of vermiculite being stored in the yard and dust from the facility blowing through downtown Libby. The jury did not find that BNSF acted intentionally or with indifference so no punitive damages were awarded. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. acquired BNSF in 2010, two decades after the W.R. Grace & Co. vermiculite mine near Libby shut down and stopped shipping the contaminated mineral.

He, his two siblings and their parents have all been diagnosed with asbestos-related diseases, Johnston said Monday.“They didn’t do anything intentionally to cause this harm to their body. Other people knew about it and didn’t care,” he said of Libby asbestos victims. “What’s that worth? It’s hard to put a value on that. But when you say you’re going to die prematurely or the life you have left is going to be tethered to an oxygen bottle, there should be some value that makes their life easier in the end.”BNSF was formed in 1995 from the merger of Burlington Northern railroad, which operated in Libby for decades, and the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation.Looming over the proceedings was W.R.

HELENA, Mont. (AP) — A federal jury on Monday said BNSF Railway contributed to the deaths of two people who were exposed to asbestos decades ago when tainted mining material was shipped through a Montana town where thousands have been sickened. The jury awarded $4 million each in compensatory damages to the estates of the two plaintiffs, who died in 2020. Jurors said asbestos-contaminated vermiculite that spilled in the rail yard in the town of Libby, Montana was a substantial factor in the plaintiffs’ illnesses and deaths. Family members of the two victims hugged their attorneys after the verdict was announced. An attorney for the plaintiffs said the ruling brought some accountability, but one family member told The Associated Press that no amount of money would replace her lost sister. “I’d rather have her than all the money in the world,” Judith Hemphill said of her sister, Joyce Walder. The vermiculite from Libby has high concentrations of naturally-occurring asbestos and was used in insulation and for other commercial purposes in homes and businesses across the U.S. After being mined from a mountaintop outside town, it was loaded onto rail cars that sometimes spilled the material in the Libby rail yard. Residents have described piles of vermiculite being stored in the yard and dust from the facility blowing through downtown Libby. The jury did not find that BNSF acted intentionally or with indifference so no punitive damages were awarded. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. acquired BNSF in 2010, two decades after the W.R. Grace & Co. vermiculite mine near Libby shut down and stopped shipping the contaminated mineral.

The jury did not find that BNSF acted intentionally or with indifference so there will be no punitive damages awarded. Attorneys for the estates of the two victims had argued that the railroad, owned by Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, knew the asbestos-tainted vermiculite was dangerous but failed to act. BNSF said its employees didn’t know the vermiculite they hauled over decades from a nearby mine was filled with hazardous microscopic asbestos fibers. The case in federal civil court over the two deaths was the first of numerous lawsuits against the Texas-based railroad corporation to reach trial over its past operations in Libby. Current and former residents of the small town near the U.S.-Canada border want BNSF held accountable, accusing it of playing a role in asbestos exposure that health officials say has killed several hundred people and sickened thousands. The railroad said it was obliged under law to ship the vermiculite, which was used in insulation and for other commercial purposes, and that W.R. Grace employees had concealed the health hazards from the railroad. BNSF attorney Chad Knight said the railroad could only be held liable if it could have foreseen the health hazards of asbestos based on information available decades ago when the alleged exposures happened. “In the 50s, 60s and 70s no one in the public suspected there might be health concerns,” Knight said Friday. The plaintiffs argued that BNSF higher-ups knew for decades that the vermiculite contained asbestos and that concerns about workers breathing asbestos dust had existed in medical journals since the late 1890s. “We’re here to make a party that accepts zero responsibility accept an appropriate amount of responsibility,” plaintiffs’ attorney Mark Lanier said in his closing statement. “This is the fault of the bigwigs in the corporate office.” The judge instructed the jury it could only find the railroad negligent based on its actions in the Libby Railyard, not for hauling the vermiculite. BNSF was formed in 1995 from the merger of Burlington Northern railroad, which operated in Libby for decades, and the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation.

    "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at Cathie Wood's latest investment portfolio and her top ten stock picks. If you want to skip our coverage of Ms. Wood, her investment firm, and the latest stock market news, then you can take a look at Cathie Wood's Latest Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.  While nearly all hedge funds invest in stocks, not all of them do so in the same manner. A fund's investment philosophy depends on a variety of factors, that are primarily determined by the nature of its head. For instance, two of the most well known hedge funds and investment holdings companies of our time are D. E. Shaw's DE Shaw and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Both of them are behemoths in the industry, but their investment approaches couldn't be further apart. Shaw, a mathematical wizard, focuses on the numbers and a secret sauce formula. Buffett, on the other hand, is a seasoned player who carefully picks out the right stocks and then holds on to them for dear life to reap literal and figurative dividends. Another hedge fund boss famous for her unique approach to investing is Cathie Wood. While Buffett is somewhat of a consumer staples investor who picks out only those companies that are well established and have wide competitive moats, Wood is a risky player. Her fund identifies firms that are most likely to disrupt their industries and then continues to invest in the hopes of a share price appreciation. One of Wood's most successful bets, which has also propelled her to Wall Street fame, is her massive stake in the world's biggest electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Wood has held on to Tesla's shares for as long as since the fourth quarter of 2016, and as an investor, she has seen it all. Based on Tesla's current stock structure following splits, a single share today that's worth $147 would have been worth $12 back then - implying that over the time period that Wood has owned the shares, Tesla's stock has appreciated by a stunning 1,125%. Identifying the right stocks always has its benefits and Wood has accrued these during her investment career. However, 2024 and 2016 are quite different. Back then, the stock market climate was more relaxed when it came to liquidity and raising capital. This is helpful for both hedge funds - who rely on leverage to make their risky bets - and high growth companies like Tesla who have to fund their daily operations via working capital and long term growth through other capital raises. In today's environment with high interest rates, managers who invest in high growth stocks face a tough time on the market and this has also been the case for Wood. Wood's flagship fund, the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), was up by a stunning 211% in March 2020 and January 2021. Then, it held on to most of these gains during the tail end of the coronavirus pandemic as the technology industry boomed due to a higher demand for computing products. 2022, marked by soaring inflation and anarchy on Wall Street because of high interest rates, wasn't great for the fund as the Ark Innovation ETF had tanked by 47% during the year. This erased all gains made during the pandemic and the ARK Innovation ETF hasn't been the same since as it currently trading at $42 - lower than its price of $44 at the onset of the stock market boom during the coronavirus pandemic. Another well known fact about Ark Invest is its willingness to regularly share insights. On this front, Wood was out with her thoughts for the first quarter of 2024 in a recent commentary where she outlined: The Federal Funds Target Rate surged 24-fold in little more than a year. The deflationary ramifications of current Fed policy already are surfacing through bankruptcies in commercial real estate, both office and multi-family, and could culminate in another round of regional bank failures. If the Fed were to lower interest rates in response, companies sacrificing short-term profitability to invest and potentially capitalize on technologically enabled super exponential growth opportunities should be prime beneficiaries. The Fed paused its tightening moves last summer. At the same time, in the technology realm, ChatGPT began to dramatize the seemingly miraculous breakthroughs that are likely to tip the scales even further toward broad-based deflation. Although creative destruction—the transition from gas-powered vehicles to electric vehicles, for example—could obfuscate the boom associated with AI and other disruptive technologies evolving today, the waves of growth associated with the convergence among the 14 technologies involved in our five major platforms—robotics, energy storage, AI, blockchain technology, and multiomics sequencing—should start moving the needle on macro metrics increasingly and significantly during the next five to ten years. In our view, history will show that inflation, initially triggered by supply shocks, was transitory and evolved into disinflation, then ultimately deflation. Consequently, interest rates are likely to surprise on the low side of expectations, broadening last year’s equity rally from a narrow subset of stocks. During the first quarter of 2024, four of ARK’s six actively managed ETFs and both indexed ETFs underperformed relative to the broad-based global equity indexes, while two actively managed ETFs had mixed performance, underperforming and the S&P 500 Index but outperforming the MSCI World Index. So, with Wood remaining as optimistic as ever, we decided to see what her latest stock picks are. A couple of important names are Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ). Cathie Wood of ARK Investment Management Our Methodology To make our list of Cathie Wood's latest stock picks, we took a look at Ark Invest's first quarter of 2024 investment portfolio and selected the biggest positions. For these latest Cathie Wood stock picks, we mentioned hedge fund sentiment.

The reality is that there's a critical battery metals shortage looming, causing executives from car producers such as Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) (NEO:TSLA) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) to take the matter very seriously. Despite Tesla reporting record Q1 2023 deliveries, Benchmark Minerals projects will require more than 300 new battery metal mines to meet future EV demand. To get there, many battery metals projects continue to be developed, including those from Lithium South Development Corporation (TSXV:LIS) (OTC:LISMF), Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB), and even Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B). Lithium South Development Corporation (TSXV:LIS) (OTC:LISMF) recently completed the final drill hole of its resource expansion program at the Hombre Muerto North Lithium Project (HMN Li Project) in Salta Province, Argentina. As its flagship asset, Lithium South's project already has a solid foundation, with a maiden resource of 0.57 MT Li2CO3 equivalent (M+I) from 2019. \"We are pleased to have completed the 2022-2023 resource expansion program at the HMN Li Project,\" said Lithium South's President and CEO, Adrian F. C. Hobkirk. \"We look forward to full results and the delineation of a new lithium resource.\" To date, Lithium South has made significant progress on the HMN Li Project, including completing a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) in April 2019. However, the original PEA assessment was based on only the Tramo claim, which covered 383 hectares of the project's initial claims. Since then, the company has significantly expanded its land position, which now comprises 5,687 hectares spread across 9 mining concessions. The monitoring wells will provide a preliminary indication of whether the claim block will support one or more shallow pumping wells for potential future lithium production. The goal of the expansion program is to increase the resource size while moving towards a full Feasibility Study for the HMN Li Project. The property is surrounded by two leading lithium producers, Livent and POSCO, which acquired the property from Galaxy Resources (now Allkem) for US$280 million. So far throughout this 2023 resource program, Lithium South has received excellent lithium values from all holes completed to date. These included an average of samples of 663 mg/L Li, with a range of 320-752 mg/L Li, and ranging from 569 mg/L Li to 708 mg/L Li in another drill hole. The latest results also include nine packer samples collected between 24 and 189 meters, with a density range of 1.215 to 1.218 g/mL and a conductivity range of 196.3 to 209.5 mS/cm. The goal of the monitoring wells are to provide a preliminary indication of whether the claim block will support one or more shallow pumping wells for potential future lithium production. To increase the potential of the HMN Li Project, Lithium South has taken steps to investigate the potential for Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) by providing three 2,000-liter bulk samples of high-quality HMN Li brine for testing. The tests were conducted by three strategic partners: China's Chemphys Chengdu, Argentina's Eon Minerals, and California-based Lilac Solutions. A similar DLE process has also drawn the interest of billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), but in California's Salton Sea instead of South America's Lithium Triangle. Through its subsidiary Berkshire Hathaway Energy Renewables ('BHE Renewables'), the company is planning for 2026 as its goal for producing lithium as a byproduct of existing geothermal energy production in the region. BHE Renewables already runs a fleet of 10 geothermal plants in the Imperial Valley. After constructing a DLE demonstration plant to assess the viability of lithium extraction, the company plans to go on to potentially build a commercial-scale facility with a projected annual capacity of 90,000 metric tons of lithium. It's worth noting, however, that an initial $15M grant from the US Department of Energy was initially awarded to BHE, only to be quietly rescinded just weeks later. After 13 months of negotiations between the company and the government, talks stalled as Berkshire sought control over patents, changes to technology, and whether it could one day sell the lithium business, even after the government helped build it, as reported by Reuters. Down in Australia, lithium giant Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) threw its weight into a serious bidding war that's heating up for Australia-based Liontown Resources, with a US$3.4 billion bid to takeout the potential competitor in advance of its completion of the Kathleen Valley project, which is expected to go into production in Q2 2024. Albemarle believes the addition of Liontown and its team would advance its strategy to produce a sustainable, high-quality supply of battery grade materials to support the clean energy transition. The offer comes at a 63% premium to Liontown's closing share price on March 27, 2023. The lithium giant has also announced a new lithium hydroxide Mega-Flex facility in South Carolina, where it plans to invest at least $1.3 billion. \"This facility will help increase the production of U.S.-based lithium resources to fuel the clean energy revolution while bringing us closer to our customers as the supply chain is built out in North America,\" said Albemarle CEO Kent Masters. \"This investment supports our long-term commitment to providing innovative products and solutions that enable a more resilient world.\" Having domestic supplies for its battery materials is crucial to US-based EV manufacturers such as Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) (NEO:TLSLA) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). So much so that Tesla has been rumored to be interested in investing in its own lithium mining company. However, CEO Elon Musk has recently tamped down that speculation stating instead that he sees iron-based batteries becoming more important to the future of EVs. According to Musk, the \"limiting factor\" is in refining lithium, not actually mining it. Thus Tesla has already broken ground on its own proposed lithium refinery in Corpus Christi, TX, with the goal of starting output within a year. Despite losing $2.1 billion selling EVs in 2022, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is doing its part to bring its costs down, starting with opening a lithium-iron-phosphate battery plant in Michigan that could bring the high costs of EVs down. Using a second battery type lets Ford boost production of EVs quicker, and lowers the cost of batteries thus making EVs more affordable to more buyers, according to Lisa Drake, VP of EV industrialization for Ford Model E, its EV unit. It was in July 2022 that Ford announced it was going to buy lithium from ioneer for its US EV battery plant. The deal was one of the first binding agreements between a U.S. lithium company and U.S. automaker, after Washington pushed more incentives to domestically source metals for the green energy transition and curb reliance on China. \"Helping unlock lithium in the U.S. will help us support localized production of battery cells going forward,\" said Drake. Under the terms of the deal, ioneer will supply 7,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate annually for five years to BlueOvalSK, Ford's battery joint venture with SK Innovation, which has a Kentucky factory.

    "published_at": "2024-04-22T12:00:24Z",
    "content": "Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Bank of America's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 49% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Ownership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock Every investor in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 59% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Bank of America.  View our latest analysis for Bank of America  Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Bank of America. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Bank of America, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Bank of America. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 13% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.2% by the third-largest shareholder. On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Bank of America Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$410m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling.  With a 28% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Bank of America. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. We can see that public companies hold 13% of the Bank of America shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

    "content": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. \n\t\tThanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.\t Bel Air Ridge in Los Angeles may not be a Boogie Wonderland — but it was home to the late, great Earth, Wind & Fire founder Maurice White. The seven-time Grammy-winning funk star passed away in 2016, at age 74. Now, the California home where he lived for some four decades, at 10122 Baywood Court, has hit the market for $3.98 million, Gimme Shelter has learned.  Built in 1978, the Tudor-style home was remodeled to showcase modern interiors.  White bought the property that year for $340,000. It sold two years after his death, in 2018, for $2.22 million. The current sellers are named Larry Greifer and Robert Adams.  At 4,165 square feet, it features four bedrooms and four baths and sits on a cul-de-sac overlooking Beverly Glen Park.  Overall, it’s as dazzling as its former resident. Born in Memphis, White was the founder, leader, main songwriter, vocalist and producer for the legendary band. Earth, Wind & fire was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2000. That year, White said: “We’ve touched so many people with these songs. That was the whole objective, to try to inspire young people to believe in themselves and to follow through on their ideas.” White also co-produced hit albums for artists including Cher, Neil Diamond and Barbra Streisand. The band is perhaps best known for the song, “September,” which had, at last count, more than 1.5 billion listens on Spotify.  The home’s main bedroom suite features a double-sided fireplace, a sitting area — and a large sun terrace with panoramic canyon, city and ocean views.  There’s also a chef’s kitchen with floor-to-ceiling cabinetry and a dining area with a wet bar that opens to the backyard.  Two additional fireplaces are in the living room and family room, while an outdoor kitchen continues the entertaining outside.  The listing brokers are Jill Epstein of Nourmand & Associates, and Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties’ brokers Daniel R.

    "published_at": "2024-04-23T13:22:26Z",
    "content": "\nView Digital Edition \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApril 23, 2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Associated Press\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n A federal jury on Monday said BNSF Railway contributed to the deaths of two people who were exposed to asbestos decades ago when tainted mining material was shipped through a Montana town where thousands have been sickened. The jury awarded $4 million each in compensatory damages to the estates of the two plaintiffs, who died in 2020. Jurors said asbestos-contaminated vermiculite that spilled in the rail yard in the town of Libby, Montana was a substantial factor in the plaintiffs’ illnesses and deaths. Family members of the two victims hugged their attorneys after the verdict was announced. An attorney for the plaintiffs said the ruling brought some accountability, but one family member told The Associated Press that no amount of money would replace her lost sister. “I’d rather have her than all the money in the world,” Judith Hemphill said of her sister, Joyce Walder. The vermiculite from Libby has high concentrations of naturally-occurring asbestos and was used in insulation and for other commercial purposes in homes and businesses across the U.S. After being mined from a mountaintop outside town, it was loaded onto rail cars that sometimes spilled the material in the Libby rail yard. Residents have described piles of vermiculite being stored in the yard and dust from the facility blowing through downtown Libby. The jury did not find that BNSF acted intentionally or with indifference so no punitive damages were awarded. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. acquired BNSF in 2010, two decades after the W.R. Grace & Co. vermiculite mine near Libby shut down and stopped shipping the contaminated mineral. The estates of the two victims argued that the railroad knew the asbestos-tainted vermiculite was dangerous and failed to clean it up. Both lived near the rail yard decades ago and died from mesothelioma, a rare lung cancer linked to asbestos exposure. The pollution in Libby has been cleaned up, largely at public expense. W.R. Grace, which played a central role in the town’s tragedy, filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and paid $1.8 billion into an asbestos trust fund to settle future cases. Yet the long timeframe over which asbestos-related diseases develop means people previously exposed are likely to continue getting sick for years to come, health officials say. The case in federal civil court over the two deaths was the first of numerous lawsuits against the Texas-based railroad corporation to reach trial over its past operations in Libby. Current and former residents of the small town near the U.S.-Canada border want BNSF held accountable, accusing it of playing a role in asbestos exposure that health officials say has killed several hundred people and sickened thousands. “This is good news. This is the first community exposure case that will hold the railroad accountable for what they’ve done,” said Mark Lanier, an attorney for Walder and Hemphill’s estates. The railroad was considering whether to appeal, said a BNSF spokesperson, who referred to it as a “very sad case.” “They (the jury) had the difficult task of evaluating conduct that occurred more than 50 years ago, before BNSF ever existed,” said Kendall Sloan, the railroad’s director of external communications. BNSF attorney Chad Knight told jurors last week the railroad’s employees didn’t know the vermiculite was filled with hazardous microscopic asbestos fibers. “In the ‘50s, ’60s and ’70s no one in the public suspected there might be health concerns,” Knight said Friday. The railroad’s experts also suggested during the trial that the plaintiffs could have been exposed to asbestos elsewhere. The railroad said it was obliged under law to ship the vermiculite, which was used in insulation and for other commercial purposes, and that W.R. Grace employees had concealed the health hazards from the railroad. U.S. District Judge Brian Morris had instructed the jury it could only find the railroad negligent based on its actions in the Libby Railyard, not for hauling the vermiculite. Former Libby resident Bill Johnston, who followed the trial, said he was glad the victims’ estates got a substantial award. Johnston, 67, recalled playing in piles of vermiculite at the rail yard as a child and helping his father add piles of the material to their home garden, where it was used as a soil amendment. He, his two siblings and their parents have all been diagnosed with asbestos-related diseases, Johnston said Monday. “They didn’t do anything intentionally to cause this harm to their body. Other people knew about it and didn’t care,” he said of Libby asbestos victims. “What’s that worth? It’s hard to put a value on that. But when you say you’re going to die prematurely or the life you have left is going to be tethered to an oxygen bottle, there should be some value that makes their life easier in the end.” BNSF was formed in 1995 from the merger of Burlington Northern railroad, which operated in Libby for decades, and the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation. Looming over the proceedings was W.R. Grace, which operated the mountaintop vermiculite mine 7 miles (11 kilometers) outside of Libby until it closed in 1990. Morris referred to the chemical company as “the elephant in the room” during the BNSF trial and reminded jurors repeatedly that the case was about the railroad’s conduct, not W.R. Grace’s separate liability. Federal prosecutors in 2005 indicted W. R. Grace and executives from the company on criminal charges over the contamination in Libby. A jury acquitted them following a 2009 trial. The Environmental Protection Agency descended on Libby after 1999 news reports of illnesses and deaths among mine workers and their families. In 2009 the agency declared in Libby the nation’s first ever public health emergency under the federal Superfund cleanup program. A second trial against the railroad over the death of a Libby resident is scheduled for May in federal court in Missoula. Δ"

    "content": "\nThought leadership is like golf— a lot of people do it and few are any good.\n Thought leadership is like golf— a lot of people do it and few are any good. Tom Corfman knows an original thought when he sees one. He’s a senior consultant with RCG where he leads the Build Better Writers program, which includes executive communication. Those two maddening communications buzzwords—thought leadership—are like golf. A lot of people do it and few are any good. Yet high-quality thought leadership can boost sales for business-to-business companies, according to a recent survey of 3,500 management types by public relations mega-giant Edelman and social media platform LinkedIn. “Thought leadership that spurs business leaders to rethink their challenges is a powerful tool for stimulating demand for your business’s products and services,” they say. How? Only by reaching this high standard: “In its purest form, thought leadership consists of genuine insight that cuts through the clutter and has a tangible, lasting impact on its audience,” consulting firm FT Longitude says. That seldom happens. Scrolling through LinkedIn for the hashtag #thoughtleadership is an unrewarding exercise, filled with posts by people droning on and on, and consultants making canned offers to help. We have eight quick tips to make your leaders stand out from the crowd. Thought leadership can take many forms. Smart concise social media posts can do the trick.  Videos can be very persuasive. While our tips apply to each of those formats, we’ll focus on longer pieces, pulling three recent examples from national newspapers, where the art form is at its highest level. 1. Be active. “It’s hard to be a thought leader if your thoughts are restricted to once a month, or every once in a while,” says Jim Ylisela, Ragan Consulting Group’s co-founder and senior partner, “5 ways to boost thought leadership.” 2.  Don’t spin. This is about the audience, not you. What you say must be reliable and free from hype. 3. Bring fresh insight. “You can type in thought leadership in Google and get a dozen different articles that say the same thing,” ForbesBooks expert Kyle Wycoff, wrote last year. 4. Take a stand. Have a point of view. Make a call for action. 5. Make it personal. Share something about yourself that relates to the topic. 6. Bring emotion. Convey passion for the topic. Or wonder. Or even anger. 7. Write well. Grab your audience’s attention and hold it. Make complicated subjects easy to understand. 8. Be timely. “By framing your thoughts around current events and trends, you’re able to engage a much bigger audience,” Entrepreneur magazine recommends. A good thought leadership piece doesn’t need to follow all these tips, but it should feature most of them. Here’s three examples: Spot a Problem Patent Lawsuits Are a National-Security Threat\nThird parties can secretly fund litigation, take a cut of the proceeds, and hamstring key companies like Intel.\nWall Street Journal\nBy Joseph Matal\nMarch 20, 2024 Third parties are increasingly funding patent litigation in the U.S. in exchange for some of the proceeds. This practice was nearly nonexistent as recently as 2010 but now appears to account for about 30% of the country’s infringement lawsuits. The government doesn’t know who pays for or controls these suits. That could allow foreign adversaries to profit from our legal system and threaten U.S. national security. Why it works\nIn his opening, Matal identifies with a single statistic a trend that sounds troubling, then makes clear why we should care with the looming presence of “foreign adversaries.” He closes with a call to action: “It’s past time for the U.S. to require disclosure of third-party litigation funding.” Matal, “a patent lawyer, served as acting director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, 2017-18,” according to the story. In the terse way of the Journal’s brief bios, something is left out. He also has an intellectual property law advisory firm. Simplify the Complicated Warren Buffett Minds the GAAP\nA 2018 rule change makes Berkshire’s earnings figures ‘worse than useless.’\nWall Street Journal\nBy Donald E. Graham\nMarch 13, 2024 There was so much news in Warren Buffett’s annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders that his lead item got far too little attention: The accounting industry’s method for corporate accounting makes no sense. Why it works\nGraham is riding on the news of Buffett’s letter. His lede combines a well-known name with a simple but provocative claim. Graham’s piece is written for sophisticated business readers, but he does a nice job of explaining a complicated topic. He has a personal connection. He’s a shareholder in Buffett’s company and has a joke relevant to the topic that the billionaire investor told him on the golf course. Buffett’s usually good for a laugh. He closes with a wry challenge to regulators: “If you believe today’s accounting rules present a clearer picture of Berkshire’s results, put it to a test. Ask Berkshire’s shareholders.” Graham is described simply as the “chairman emeritus of Graham Holdings Co.” But savvy readers might recognize him as the former CEO of The Washington Post until he sold it to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Tell your Story Scams are on the rise, and they’re ruining lives. We can stop it.\nThe Washington Post\nBy William Webster and Lynda Webster\nMarch 25, 2024 Ten years ago, we became targets of a scam involving a Jamaican crime ring that tried to defraud us of $50,000 over the phone. It was a harrowing experience, but it drove home a sobering reality — if it could happen to a former director of the FBI and CIA, it could happen to anyone. Since that 2014 episode, we have given numerous public interviews about the need for scam awareness, especially to protect older Americans like us. But we have watched with alarm as scam attacks have nevertheless continued to grow in sophistication and consumer losses have skyrocketed. Why it works\nTalk about making it personal! The second paragraph explains why they are writing now: The problem is soaring, despite their efforts to highlight it. The Websters (she’s the founder and chair of an event management firm), build a convincing case with statistics that scams are growing. Then they present four steps to reduce fraud, offering the British government as an example. The Edelman-LinkedIn report concludes: “Despite the clear power of thought leadership to drive business results, most organizations say it is under-resourced, misused, and not measured appropriately.” Other than that it’s fine! These tips should help leaders improve their game.

    "title": "Warren Buffett-owned BNSF Railway contributed to 2 deaths in Montana town where asbestos sickened thousands, jury finds",
    "description": "Jurors said asbestos-contaminated vermiculite that spilled in the rail yard in the town of Libby, Montana was a substantial factor in the plaintiffs’ illnesses and deaths.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-23T09:04:05Z",
    "content": "A federal jury on Monday said BNSF Railway contributed to the deaths of two people who were exposed to asbestos decades ago when tainted mining material was shipped through a Montana town where thousands have been sickened. The jury awarded $4 million each in compensatory damages to the estates of the two plaintiffs, who died in 2020. Jurors said asbestos-contaminated vermiculite that spilled in the rail yard in the town of Libby, Montana was a substantial factor in the plaintiffs’ illnesses and deaths. Family members of the two victims hugged their attorneys after the verdict was announced. An attorney for the plaintiffs said the ruling brought some accountability, but one family member told The Associated Press that no amount of money would replace her lost sister. “I’d rather have her than all the money in the world,” Judith Hemphill said of her sister, Joyce Walder. The vermiculite from Libby has high concentrations of naturally-occurring asbestos and was used in insulation and for other commercial purposes in homes and businesses across the U.S. After being mined from a mountaintop outside town, it was loaded onto rail cars that sometimes spilled the material in the Libby rail yard. Residents have described piles of vermiculite being stored in the yard and dust from the facility blowing through downtown Libby. The jury did not find that BNSF acted intentionally or with indifference so no punitive damages were awarded. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. acquired BNSF in 2010, two decades after the W.R. Grace & Co. vermiculite mine near Libby shut down and stopped shipping the contaminated mineral. The estates of the two victims argued that the railroad knew the asbestos-tainted vermiculite was dangerous and failed to clean it up. Both lived near the rail yard decades ago and died from mesothelioma, a rare lung cancer linked to asbestos exposure. The pollution in Libby has been cleaned up, largely at public expense. W.R. Grace, which played a central role in the town’s tragedy, filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and paid $1.8 billion into an asbestos trust fund to settle future cases. Yet the long timeframe over which asbestos-related diseases develop means people previously exposed are likely to continue getting sick for years to come, health officials say. The case in federal civil court over the two deaths was the first of numerous lawsuits against the Texas-based railroad corporation to reach trial over its past operations in Libby. Current and former residents of the small town near the U.S.-Canada border want BNSF held accountable, accusing it of playing a role in asbestos exposure that health officials say has killed several hundred people and sickened thousands. “This is good news. This is the first community exposure case that will hold the railroad accountable for what they’ve done,” said Mark Lanier, an attorney for Walder and Hemphill’s estates. The railroad was considering whether to appeal, said a BNSF spokesperson, who referred to it as a “very sad case.” “They (the jury) had the difficult task of evaluating conduct that occurred more than 50 years ago, before BNSF ever existed,” said Kendall Sloan, the railroad’s director of external communications. BNSF attorney Chad Knight told jurors last week the railroad’s employees didn’t know the vermiculite was filled with hazardous microscopic asbestos fibers. “In the ‘50s, ’60s and ’70s no one in the public suspected there might be health concerns,” Knight said Friday. The railroad’s experts also suggested during the trial that the plaintiffs could have been exposed to asbestos elsewhere. The railroad said it was obliged under law to ship the vermiculite, which was used in insulation and for other commercial purposes, and that W.R. Grace employees had concealed the health hazards from the railroad. U.S. District Judge Brian Morris had instructed the jury it could only find the railroad negligent based on its actions in the Libby Railyard, not for hauling the vermiculite. Former Libby resident Bill Johnston, who followed the trial, said he was glad the victims’ estates got a substantial award. Johnston, 67, recalled playing in piles of vermiculite at the rail yard as a child and helping his father add piles of the material to their home garden, where it was used as a soil amendment. He, his two siblings and their parents have all been diagnosed with asbestos-related diseases, Johnston said Monday. “They didn’t do anything intentionally to cause this harm to their body. Other people knew about it and didn’t care,” he said of Libby asbestos victims. “What’s that worth? It’s hard to put a value on that. But when you say you’re going to die prematurely or the life you have left is going to be tethered to an oxygen bottle, there should be some value that makes their life easier in the end.” BNSF was formed in 1995 from the merger of Burlington Northern railroad, which operated in Libby for decades, and the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation. Looming over the proceedings was W.R. Grace, which operated the mountaintop vermiculite mine 7 miles (11 kilometers) outside of Libby until it closed in 1990. Morris referred to the chemical company as “the elephant in the room” during the BNSF trial and reminded jurors repeatedly that the case was about the railroad’s conduct, not W.R. Grace’s separate liability. Federal prosecutors in 2005 indicted W. R. Grace and executives from the company on criminal charges over the contamination in Libby. A jury acquitted them following a 2009 trial. The Environmental Protection Agency descended on Libby after 1999 news reports of illnesses and deaths among mine workers and their families. In 2009 the agency declared in Libby the nation’s first ever public health emergency under the federal Superfund cleanup program. A second trial against the railroad over the death of a Libby resident is scheduled for May in federal court in Missoula. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

    "content": "BNSF Railway attorneys told a Montana jury that the railroad should not be held liable for the lung cancer deaths of two former residents of an asbestos-contaminated Montana town, one of the deadliest sites in the federal Superfund pollution program. Attorneys for the company say the corporate predecessors of the railroad, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, didn’t know the vermiculite they hauled over decades from a nearby mine was filled with hazardous microscopic asbestos fibers or that asbestos was dangerous. BNSF attorney Chad Knight said the railroad could only be held liable if it could have foreseen the health hazards of asbestos based on information available decades ago when the alleged exposures happened. “In the 50s, 60s and 70s no one in the public suspected there might be health concerns,” Knight said. The case in federal civil court is the first of numerous lawsuits against the Texas-based railroad corporation to reach trial over its past operations in Libby, Montana. Current and former residents of the small town near the U.S.-Canada border want BNSF held accountable for its alleged role in asbestos exposure that health officials say has killed several hundred people and sickened thousands. The seven-member jury met briefly Friday and planned to resume deliberations on Monday morning. They were instructed to decide if the railroad was at fault in the deaths and if so, the amount of damages to award to their estates. If the jurors find that the railroad should also face punitive damages, a separate hearing would determine that amount. Looming over the proceedings is W.R. Grace & Co., a chemical company that operated a mountaintop vermiculite mine 7 miles outside of Libby until it was closed 1990. The Maryland-based company played a central role in Libby’s tragedy and has paid significant settlements to victims. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris has referred to the the chemical company as “the elephant in the room” in the BNSF trial. He reminded jurors several times that the case was about the railroad’s conduct, not W.R. Grace’s separate liability. How much W.R. Grace revealed about the asbestos dangers to Texas-based BNSF and its corporate predecessors has been sharply disputed. The plaintiffs argued that railroad higher-ups were aware, but that workers on the ground in Libby were left out of the loop. “We’re here to make a party that accepts zero responsibility accept an appropriate amount of responsibility,” plaintiffs’ attorney Mark Lanier said. “This is the fault of the bigwigs in the corporate office.” The judge instructed the jury it could only find the railroad negligent based on its actions in the Libby Railyard, not for hauling the vermiculite. The railroad said it was obliged under law to ship the vermiculite, which was used in insulation and for other commercial purposes. It said W.R. Grace employees had concealed the health hazards from the railroad. Former railroad workers said during testimony and in depositions that they knew nothing about the risks of asbestos. They said Grace employees were responsible for loading the hopper cars, plugging the holes of any cars leaking vermiculite and occasionally cleaned up material that spilled in the rail yard. The estates of the two deceased plaintiffs have argued that the W.R. Grace’s actions don’t absolve BNSF of its responsibility for failing to clean up the vermiculite that spilled in the railyard in the heart of the community. Their attorneys said BNSF should have known about the dangers because Grace put signs on rail cars carrying vermiculite warning of potential health risks. They showed jurors an image of a warning label allegedly attached to rail cars in the late 1970s that advised against inhaling the asbestos dust because it could cause bodily harm. Family members of Tom Wells and Joyce Walder testified that their lives ended soon after they were diagnosed with mesothelioma. The families said the dust blowing from the rail yard sickened and killed them. In a March 2020 video of Wells played for jurors and recorded the day before he died, he lay in a home hospital bed, struggling to breathe. “I’ve been placed in a horrible spot here, and the best chance I see at release — relief for everybody — is to just get it over with,” he said. “It’s just not something I want to try and play hero through because I don’t think that there’s a miracle waiting.” The Environmental Protection Agency descended on Libby after the 1999 news reports. In 2009 it declared in Libby the nation’s first ever public health emergency under the federal Superfund cleanup program. The pollution in Libby has been cleaned up, largely at public expense. Yet the long timeframe over which asbestos-related diseases develop means people previously exposed are likely to continue getting sick for years to come, health officials say.

    "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Legendary investor Warren Buffett, through his holding company Berkshire Hathaway, has built an impressive portfolio of stocks over the years. One of his most significant holdings is Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC), which, according to the latest 13F filing, accounts for 1,032,852,006 shares. With a forward dividend rate of $0.96 per share, Berkshire Hathaway is set to receive a staggering $991,537,925.76 in annual dividend income from Bank of America alone. This averages out to approximately $2,709,120 per day in 2024. Buffett’s stake in the second largest bank in the U.S. dates back to 2007, and his firm now owns an impressive 13.08% of the company. In fact, Bank of America is Berkshire Hathaway’s second-largest holding, making up approximately 10% of its portfolio. The only stock that surpasses it is Apple Inc., which accounts for just over 50% of the firm’s portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway owns 905,560,000 shares of Apple, which has a forward annual dividend payout of $0.96 per share, translating to a total annual dividend income of $869,337,600.00 from the tech giant. Recent analyst ratings for Bank of America have been positive, with Wolfe Research, BMO Capital, and Oppenheimer releasing their reports on April 19, 2024, April 18, 2024, and April 17, 2024, respectively. The average price target from these three analysts stands at $41.33, implying a potential upside of 7.79% for the stock. While Buffett’s success and his company’s substantial stake in Bank of America may tempt investors to follow suit, it’s important to remember that not all of Buffett’s investments are suitable for everyone. Here are a few reasons why: Different Risk Tolerance: Buffett’s investment strategy is based on his unique risk tolerance and long-term outlook. Individual investors may have different risk profiles and investment horizons, which may not align with Buffett’s approach. Portfolio Diversification: Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio is highly concentrated, with just two stocks (Apple and Bank of America) making up over 60% of its holdings. This level of concentration may not be appropriate for most individual investors who require a more diversified portfolio to manage risk. Timing: Buffett’s investments are often made at opportune times, such as during market downturns or when a company is undervalued. Trying to mimic his moves without the same level of market insight and timing could lead to suboptimal results. Resources: Berkshire Hathaway has access to vast resources, including a team of analysts and a substantial cash reserve, which allows the company to make large, strategic investments. Individual investors may not have the same resources at their disposal. Unique Opportunities: Some of Buffett’s investments, such as the preferred shares with warrants he received during the financial crisis, are not available to the average investor. In conclusion, while Warren Buffett’s investment in Bank of America is undoubtedly impressive, with the company set to receive over $2.7 million per day in dividend income, individual investors should carefully consider their own investment goals, risk tolerance, and resources before attempting to mimic his moves.

    "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best ethical companies to invest in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of ESG stocks, then you can take a look at 5 Best Ethical Companies to Invest in 2024.  The relationship of the corporate sector with the well-being of the general population is always controversial. On one end, firms like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) have transformed people's lives and allowed them to improve their health, stay connected, and shop for countless products affordably. On the other end, some of the most controversial companies in the world are among the most valuable as well. The best examples of these are the oil mega giants such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) who are often targeted by environmental activists due to the polluting effects of their products. Balancing both these factors, i.e. the negative externalities that result from the costs of doing business and the benefits to society of private enterprise, is a field called Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). ESG seeks to invest only in those companies that are aware of the impact that their operations make on the environment and are actively working to mitigate this impact. It is a relatively newer phenomenon, and despite its noble objectives, the trend seems to have run into roadblocks as of late. This is because the stock market of 2024 is quite different from the 'environment' that was in play in 2018, when ESG investing was gaining traction. In 2018, sustainable investing surged to $30 trillion, as investors forced companies to become more climate conscious and favored those that took the initiative. However, in 2018, interest rates weren't as high as they are right now, and inflation had not yet tasted the impacts of loose monetary policies and global supply chain disruptions. In 2024, the stock market and the broader finance industry are still recovering from both of these. While rates are still high and creating constraints for investors to raise capital, inflation is on a downward trend. At the same time, the fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine has shown that the global oil industry is still quite crucial to economic well being despite the fact that fossil fuels are also some of the biggest polluters on the planet. Taking a look at recent stats, data from Bloomberg shows that 2023 wasn't a particularly great year for ESG. The ESG market fell to $30.3 trillion in 2023 from $35 trillion at the start of the year, and subsequent data showed that 2023 was the worst year on record for the sector. This data comes from Morningstar Financial and it reveals that during the fourth quarter of 2023, sustainable funds marked their first full year of outflows in a decade. In Q4 alone, a whopping $5 billion went out of these funds, a figure that jumps to $13 billion for the full year. These outflows came on the back of disappointing performance of sustainable equity funds in particular, as Morningstar's data shows that \"32% of sustainable equity funds dropped to the bottom quartile relative to peers.\" This also ensured that the fourth quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter where investors preferred sustainable funds when compared to their traditional counterparts. Before we head to the best ethical companies, it's also important to know why ESG and stocks with a focus on the environment and broader business sustainability tend to have shied away from gains as of late. One of the biggest reasons behind this is high interest rates, which means that earning a profit becomes difficult. Therefore, companies that focus on sustainability have to deal with high business costs and have to fund costly projects, which means that investors find a better bang for their buck elsewhere. On a final note, here's what Madison Investments had to say about its Madison Sustainable Equity Fund's performance during the fourth quarter of 2023: Equity markets finished the year on a strong note with the S&P 500 up 11.7% during the fourth quarter, bringing the full year return to 26.3%. The Madison Sustainable Equity Fund (Class Y) returned 11.9% in the fourth quarter but lagged the S&P 500 for the full year, returning 18.0%. The strength during the fourth quarter can be attributed to the downward shift of the yield curve. Interest rates dropped during the fourth quarter as inflation moderated and the market began to discount an end to Fed rate hikes and even began discounting interest rate cuts in 2024. Rates rose during the third quarter, with the 2-year Treasury rising to 5.05% and the 10-year moving to 4.58%, its highest level since September 2007. Then in the fourth quarter, the 2-year rate fell to 4.35% and the 10-year fell to 3.94%. Both fixed income and equities rallied in the fourth quarter. The economy is still growing, real GDP grew 4.9% in Q3 and is expected to grow 1.2% in Q4, and 1.3% in 2024. Headline inflation is moderating but remains above the desired 2%. Inflation fell to 3.5% in Q3 and is expected to drop to 3.2% in Q4 with expectations for inflation to fall to 2.6% in 2024. Unemployment remains low at 3.7%, and the consumer continues to spend. However, with Covid savings dwindling and credit card balances rising, we anticipate consumer spending will slow in 2024. The market now expects that the Federal Reserve will cut the Fed Funds rate in 2024. Expectations are for the Fed to begin cutting rates in the second quarter. We continue to expect the Fed to keep rates high until inflation moves closer to 2%, which may not happen until 2025. With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top ethical stocks. A couple of top picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). A trader at a stock exchange, vigorously watching the stocks' trends in the stock market. Our Methodology To make our list of the best ethical stocks, we ranked the top 30 most valuable holdings of the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during the fourth quarter of 2023 and picked the top stocks. For these best ethical stocks, we mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator. Number of Q4 2023 Hedge Fund Shareholders: 105  Adobe Inc.

Inman Connect At Inman Connect Las Vegas, July 30-Aug. 1, 2024, the noise and misinformation will be banished, all your big questions will be answered, and new business opportunities will be revealed. Join us. Whether you are venturing into the world of real estate for the first time or simply desiring a change, selecting the right brokerage is no easy feat. Throughout our 28 years in the industry, my partner, Brandon Holland, and I have experienced firsthand the significant impact that a good brokerage can have on career growth. Each brokerage is unique in its own right with a set of pros and cons, but the most important factor when selecting a brokerage is which one is right for you.  TAKE THE INMAN INTEL INDEX SURVEY FOR APRIL So, how do you determine which brokerage is right for you? Detailed below are elements that we have considered throughout the span of our career as we learned which brokerage was the best fit for us.  Deciding between a boutique or large brokerage is the first step in determining which will be best for you long term. Both types allow you to give your clients what they need, but it’s a matter of understanding your own needs when comparing the two types. While joining a larger brokerage entails more direction and support, a boutique brokerage tends to provide an independent atmosphere. If you are a team player and thrive in a group environment, larger brokerages are the place to be.  As a member of a double-agent team, a larger brokerage suits our needs in different ways than a boutique brokerage would be able to. However, brand recognition holds significant weight when you’re part of a team, so it’s worthwhile to consider how important that is to you before going all in with a larger brokerage.  There may also be times during your career when you switch between both boutique and larger firms, and Holland and I have done this over the years. By experiencing both, you’ll have a better understanding of what best suits your long-term needs. We are currently a part of a large brokerage that offers the best of both worlds. We have access to an internationally renowned reputation and the resources of a large brokerage, in addition to the creativity and flexibility that a boutique brokerage typically offers.  We have found that larger brokerages often convey a stronger reputation — a factor influential in shaping work culture. Yet reputation, whether born from size or service quality, consistently plays a pivotal role in defining the professional environment. Our exploration of both superior large and small brokerages reveals a common denominator: the wealth of resources designed to empower and support you. Agents must be equipped with an array of supports, ranging from marketing aids to technological tools, to navigate the industry successfully. Holland and I particularly value this foundation as we forge our team’s identity. Strong support allows everyone to succeed and meet their individual goals. Resource access provides great support when achieving one’s goals, but we have come to learn that the key to a supportive brokerage culture is ultimately the people. People build a brand.  As real estate agents, we are responsible for establishing our own brand and representing the brand of our brokerage. However, it is leadership that is responsible for giving us the tools to do so. An agent’s relationship with their brokerage is supposed to be a symbiotic one that embodies a partnership.  Finding a brokerage that you have a strong relationship with often shows off their strong leadership. The leadership should be there when you need them, helping to maintain both your brand and their brand.  The partnership should build businesses up. When selecting a brokerage, it is important to be dedicated to your own career but also remember the value of support. The type of brokerage plays a large role in determining which one is right for you, but at the end of the day, one size doesn’t fit all. While our brokerage is considered a larger brokerage, Holland and I selected them because of their unique qualities.  Being a part of both boutique and larger brokerages, we have found that experiencing both was necessary for realizing which is the right fit for our team. Overall, don’t be afraid to take your time when determining which type of brokerage you want to join. Take all the factors and supports into consideration when making your decision. Most importantly, make sure to consider your clients, and which brokerage will be able to support you the best while you support them.

    "title": "10 Richest Investors in The World",
    "description": "Who are currently the ten wealthiest investors in the world? How did they make their wealth? This list covers the richest investors, from Ray Dalio to Warren Buffett.\nThe post 10 Richest Investors in The World appeared first on LUXUO.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-24T02:39:42Z",
    "content": "Who are currently the ten wealthiest investors in the world? How did they make their wealth? This list covers the richest investors, from Ray Dalio to Warren Buffett. American economist Paul Samuelson once described investing as “watching paint dry, or grass grow.” It’s a battle of patience where investors must be disciplined in their predictions amid the allure of short-term gains and financial challenges. A few who have withstood this pressure to be profitable can now lay the claim as the richest in the world. Let’s count down the ten wealthiest investors globally. Estimated net worth: USD 15.4 billion Ray Dalio is an American investor and hedge fund manager. While boasting years of experience as a stock trader and futures broker, most of his wealth came from Bridgewater Associates. The former is a hedge fund that Dalio founded in 1975, of which he serves as a co-chief investment officer. It serves large clients in foreign governments, central banks, endowments, and pension funds. Bridgewater is among the best-performing hedge funds (and one of the largest worldwide), currently having USD 125 billion in assets under management. Estimated net worth: USD 18 billion Michael Platt is another of several investors who made their fortunes as a hedge fund manager. He co-founded BlueCrest Capital Management in 2000, one of Europe’s largest hedge funds. Platt is frequently mentioned among the wealthiest UK citizens. The billionaire’s first introduction to investing was with stocks. He graduated from the London School of Economics in 1991, the same year he joined financial giant JP Morgan. Platt moved up the trading ranks for the company before co-founding BlueCrest in 2000. Estimated net worth: USD 19.8 billion Steve Cohen is another American billionaire hedge fund manager like Ray Dalio. He got his investing break in 1978 as a junior trader in the now-defunct boutique private banking company Gruntal & Co. This was before the investor founded a group of hedge funds named SAC Capital Advisors in 1992. Cohen is also known for one of the biggest criminal charges against a hedge fund. SAC Capital Advisors closed in 2013 after he pleaded guilty to insider trading and financial crimes like wire fraud. Nevertheless, Cohen founded a new hedge fund, Point72 Asset Management, which is still active. Estimated net worth: USD 20.6 billion David Tepper is the next American billionaire hedge fund manager on this top 10 list. Tepper’s hedge fund, Appaloosa Management (founded in 1993), is unique in specializing in distressed debt. Here, hedge funds purchase the bonds of companies that have declared bankruptcy or may do so. Experts regard investing in distressed debt as much riskier than other markets. Yet, the returns are substantial, explaining Tepper’s source of wealth and demonstrating his investing genius. Besides distressed debt, Tepper’s hedge fund also invests in fixed-income and public equity. Estimated net worth: USD 20.6 billion Unlike the previous hedge fund tycoons, Jeff Yass is an American billionaire who made his wealth in multiple trading and investing industries. Most of his riches come from co-founding the Susquehanna International Group in 1987. The trading and technology company invests in several markets, such as options, stocks, forex trading, and commodities, as well as derivative products, venture capital, and many others. Yass is also known for investing in then-unknown ByteDance in 2012, which owns one of the world’s most popular video-sharing platforms, TikTok. Estimated net worth: USD 31.2 billion Masayoshi Son is an eccentric Japanese technology entrepreneur and investor who founded SoftBank, one of the world’s largest holding companies. Interestingly, some have dubbed Son the ‘worst investor ever.’ Despite this, his USD 20 million investment in Alibaba in 2000 remains the envy of many, given that this stake was worth multiple billions when the company went public in 2014. SoftBank is highly diversified, investing in software, artificial intelligence, robotics, logistics, real estate, e-commerce, finance, and information technology, among many other areas. Estimated net worth: USD 31.4 billion Jim Simmons is a unique billionaire investor since he’s also a mathematician with a doctorate. He even worked as a code breaker during the Cold War. It’s this genius that helped him co-develop Renaissance Technologies in 1978. This quantitative hedge fund uses “mathematical and statistical methods in the design and execution of its investment programs.” Many analysts regard the fund as one of the best-performing in history. Estimated net worth: USD 36.4 billion Ken Griffin is another investing and hedge fund mogul with one of the most profitable hedge funds, Citadel LLC. While many of the investors already profiled are in their mid-60s, the American is the youngest at 55 years. After starting his trading career in a dorm room at Harvard University in 1987, Griffin eventually founded Citadel three years later. The investor added equity, trading, and fixed-income subsidiaries and created one of the US’ largest market makers, Citadel Securities. Estimated net worth: USD 38.2 billion Stephen Schwarzman is an American billionaire who became successful through private equity ventures with Blackstone Inc. The former is an alternative investment company known for being among the most substantial investors in leveraged buyouts. Blackstone is the most valuable alternative investment firm, with assets under management exceeding USD 1 trillion as of 2024. It’s also active in other industries, including hedge funds, real estate, credit, insurance, growth equity, etc. Estimated net worth: USD 38.2 billion The top person on this list shouldn’t come as a surprise for investing followers. At 93, Warren Buffett is the richest investor and widely considered the greatest. Many applaud Buffett for his value investing principles and long-term patience. The ‘Oracle of Omaha’ has been investing since his pre-teen days before a successful business career in his early 20s. Like Son, Buffett also developed his own holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the early 60s. He used the profits from this then-ailing textile mill to buy stocks of many other businesses in the decades to come. Simultaneously, Berkshire Hathaway gained holdings in massive blue-chip corporations. The first takeaway from this list is that many wealthy investors made their money through hedge funds. Moreover, these companies have existed for decades, emphasizing the importance of long-term profit forecasting and sustainable businesses. It’s also no wonder that the ultra-rich investors are over 55. This exemplifies their incredible patience and the fact that you become better at your craft the older you get.

About the latest partnership, homegenius Chief Digital Officer Eric Ray said it marks a major advancement for the company. “By integrating Local Logic’s location intelligence into our homegenius platform, our clients [get] unparalleled insights into properties and neighborhoods, enhancing decision-making in the real estate market,” Ray said. Homegenius’ search functionality identifies interior finishes, appliances and other home characteristics to empower homeshoppers to quickly and directly compare specific rooms of homes on their tour list, and search for unique amenities that don’t often make an MLS query. It can also be used to show how seller design choices can affect price and drive buying decisions and, thus, impact a CMA. Much of this is carried out through computer vision, a form of visual artificial intelligence. The company has enterprise accounts in place with several brokerages, including marketing network Leading Real Estate Companies of the World and Berkshire Hathaway. Meanwhile, Local Logic also partners directly with multiple listing services, connecting its 2023-launched NeighborhoodIntel product with more than 85,000 real estate agents through integrations with BeachesMLS, MLSListings and REcolorado, among others. The product can provide agents and consumers with more than 250 insights per address, according to the company, which raised $13 million in Series B funding in August 2023 to advance its product sophistication and industry footprint, Inman reported. In March, Local Logic released a series of APIs (application programming interfaces) and SDKs (software development kits) under the name NeighborhoodWrap, the information from which can be used to augment targeted landing pages to associate with email, social media, video and listing presentations, among other marketing efforts. “We are excited to partner with homegenius to bring our advanced location intelligence directly into the hands of consumers and real estate professionals,” said Vincent-Charles Hodder, CEO of Local Logic,” in a statement. ”This partnership is a testament to our commitment to enhancing the real estate industry through data-driven solutions that empower users with comprehensive insights into properties and their environments.” Email Craig Rowe Simply enter the email address you used to create your account and click \"Reset Password\".

The Federal Railroad Administration announced Thursday that the railroad owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway had agreed to let its roughly 650 dispatchers participate in the program that all the major railroads promised to join after last year's disastrous Norfolk Southern derailment in Ohio. “Rail workers deserve to know they’re safe when they’re on the job — and if they experience anything that compromises their safety, they should be able to report it without worrying if their job is in jeopardy,” said Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Buttigieg has been urging the railroads to improve safety ever since the February 2023 derailment.  “We hope this program will further empower our employees to provide confidential feedback on critical safety issues in an actionable, timely manner,\" BNSF CEO Katie Farmer said. Until NS became the first railroad to sign onto the anonymous reporting system in January, all the major freight railroads resisted joining because they wanted the ability to discipline workers who use the hotline in certain circumstances. The Association of American Railroads trade group has said railroads were worried that the system could be abused by workers who try to avoid discipline by reporting situations a railroad already knows about. But the idea of disciplining workers who report safety concerns undermines the entire purpose of such a hotline because workers won’t use it if they fear retribution, unions and workplace safety experts said. That's especially important on the railroads where there is a long history of workers being fired for reporting safety violations or injuries. The president of the American Train Dispatchers Association, Ed Dowell, said this move “marks a pivotal moment for rail safety.”  “As a program focused on proactive safety measures, it will serve as the new standard for reporting, understanding, and preventing rail incidents,\" Dowell said. The Norfolk Southern program is also limited in scope. Only about 1,000 members of the two unions representing engineers and conductors who work in three locations on that railroad can participate. Besides Norfolk Southern and now BNSF, only Amtrak and several dozen small railroads use the government reporting program. Part of why the big railroads — that also include Union Pacific, CSX, CPKC and Canadian National — have resisted joining the federal system is because they all have their own internal safety reporting hotlines. But railroad unions have consistently said workers are reluctant to use the railroads’ own safety hotlines because they fear retribution.

    "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. In his 2016 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, legendary investor Warren Buffett wrote, “Every decade or so, dark clouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons.” According to Buffett’s sage advice, now might be the perfect time to invest in high-yield assets while interest rates remain elevated. One popular high-yield stock that has caught the eye of income-hungry investors is AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC). With a jaw-dropping dividend yield of 15.38%, it’s easy to see why. However, a closer look at AGNC’s performance reveals some notable risks. While AGNC’s sky-high dividend yield is certainly enticing, the company’s recent performance paints a less rosy picture: Year-to-date, AGNC shares are down 4.3% Over the past year, the stock has fallen 5.18% The 5-year performance is a dismal -48.55% AGNC’s dividend rate has remained flat since early 2020 More on Buffett: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. AGNC primarily invests in agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which are backed by government-sponsored entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. While these securities are considered nearly risk-free due to their government backing, financing them through short-term leverage has become increasingly challenging in the current interest rate environment. As rates have risen, AGNC has seen its debt servicing costs skyrocket while its interest income has stalled. The company has relied heavily on derivatives like interest rate swaps and shorting U.S. Treasuries to hedge against higher rates and prop up earnings. But as these hedges begin to expire, AGNC’s ability to maintain its lofty dividend and shareholder value is being called into question. For investors seeking high yields backed by real estate assets without the excessive risks, the Cityfunds Yield fund offers a compelling alternative. While AGNC primarily invests in residential mortgages, Cityfunds focuses on home equity investments – a key distinction. Here’s what makes the Cityfunds Yield fund stand out: Targeting a stable 8% APY with quarterly distributions Backed by a diversified pool of collateralized real estate loans Invests in home equity agreement-backed notes and short-term mortgage notes Offers a manager-guaranteed base yield of 7% Five-year term fund with redemption available after a 12-month lock-up By investing in a mix of home equity-backed notes and short-term mortgages, Cityfunds aims to generate steady interest income that can be distributed to investors on a quarterly basis. The fund’s 65% to 80% loan-to-value target on its home equity investments provides an added layer of security. Unlike AGNC, which has seen its book value per share plummet from nearly $18 to under $9 in just over four years, Cityfunds’ focus on home equity and conservative LTV ratios helps protect investor capital. And with a guaranteed base yield of 7%, investors can count on a reliable income stream even in challenging market conditions. See how much you could earn with the Cityfunds Yield fund >> While AGNC’s 15%+ dividend yield might look like a golden opportunity at first glance, savvy investors know that all that glitters isn’t gold. The company’s shaky performance, overreliance on complex hedging strategies, and exposure to a shrinking agency MBS market should give potential buyers pause. For those heeding Buffett’s call to “put out the bucket” and capture high yields while the economic storm rages on, the Cityfunds Yield fund offers a more stable, risk-adjusted way to invest in real estate-backed cash flows. With quarterly distributions, a guaranteed base yield, and a conservative approach to home equity investing, Cityfunds is making it rain for income investors. Ready to learn more? Click here to explore the Cityfunds Yield fund and start putting Buffett’s timeless wisdom to work in your portfolio. Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

    "content": "search Developer committed to partially fund overhaul of Coral Gables park, cover cost overruns From left: Allen Morris Company’s Allen and Spencer Morris along with a rendering of Ponce Park Residences in Coral Gables (Getty, Allen Morris Company) SHARE THIS ARTICLE FONT SIZE After a number of rejections and opposition from neighbors, the Allen Morris Company secured approval for a downsized version of its plans for Ponce Park Residences in Coral Gables that’s been years in the making.  The latest version of its plans call for a nine-story building with 57 luxury condos at 3000 Ponce de Leon Boulevard, across from the major mixed-use Plaza Coral Gables development. In 2021, Allen Morris proposed a 16-story building with up to 160 residential units.  Last week, the Coral Gables City Commission voted unanimously on first reading to pass ordinances changing the land use to high-rise intensity from low-rise intensity, vacating the alleyway between the properties and changing a zoning district boundary. Allen Morris will also contribute $2 million in public improvements and will cover the funding gap or raise money to fill the gap for the revamp of Ponce Circle Park and pay for any cost overruns. The park currently sits between the Allen Morris site and the Plaza.  The commission will vote on additional ordinances tied to the project at a later commission meeting.  Zyscovich Architects is designing Ponce Park Residences, which will include about 20,000 square feet of ground-floor and mezzanine retail space and a cobblestone paseo that will replace the existing alleyway. Amenities will include pools, restaurants, a gym and spa.  One Sotheby’s International Realty will lead sales and marketing of the project, the brokerage’s president Daniel de la Vega told The Real Deal. Sales are expected to launch this year. He said the exact unit count could change, but that the project will be a high-end boutique development.  “We expect to see buyers downsizing from Gables Estates, Journey’s End, and [migrating] from Miami Beach,” he said. Referring to Apple’s office lease at the Plaza, de la Vega said Ponce Park Residences “could be a great option for many of those executives.” The tech giant is taking 42,000 square feet of space at Agave Holdings’ development.  Ron Shuffield, president and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty, was among those urging the commission to vote for the Ponce Park project at last week’s commission meeting.  A handful of neighbors who previously opposed Allen Morris’ plans spoke out in support of the latest version. Residents were previously concerned with the size and density of the project, the lack of green space, the effect on traffic and approving such a large project following approval and development of the Plaza, which is not an Allen Morris development.  Allen Morris assembled the Ponce Park Residences site between 2011 and 2018, said Javier Fernandez, the developer’s attorney. It also includes the properties at 216 and 224 Catalonia Avenue, 203 University Drive and 225 Malaga Avenue.

Inman Connect At Inman Connect Las Vegas, July 30-Aug. 1, 2024, the noise and misinformation will be banished, all your big questions will be answered, and new business opportunities will be revealed. Join us. The same judge overseeing the bombshell Sitzer | Burnett antitrust commission case has merged two major similar suits filed in his court challenging the current U.S. commission structure and aiming to represent millions of homesellers nationwide. On Tuesday, Judge Stephen R. Bough of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri approved a motion to consolidate the cases, known as Gibson and Umpa after their lead plaintiffs. The Sitzer | Burnett plaintiffs’ attorneys filed Gibson on Oct. 31, minutes after a jury in Sitzer | Burnett awarded $1.78 billion in damages to a class of approximately 500,000 Missouri homeowners after finding the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and major real estate franchisors had conspired to inflate broker commission rates paid by homesellers. TAKE THE INMAN INTEL INDEX SURVEY FOR APRIL The plaintiffs’ attorneys for another, similar case filed in Chicago, known as Moehrl, filed the Umpa case in December. Now that the cases have been merged, they will continue under the Gibson banner and case number. Judge Stephen R. Bough In his order approving an April 19 motion to consolidate from the Gibson and Umpa plaintiffs, Bough said he found consolidation appropriate given that the two cases “involve common questions of law and fact, consolidation will conserve judicial resources and promote efficiency, and consolidation will not cause undue delay, confusion, or prejudice.” None of the defendants opposed the motion to consolidate. Bough also gave the plaintiffs leave to file a consolidated amended class action complaint, which they did on Tuesday. “Plaintiffs, home sellers who listed homes on Multiple Listing Services in the United States (‘the MLS’), bring this action against the National Association of Realtors (‘NAR’) and several of the largest families of national real estate brokerages, brokerage owners, and franchisors in the United States (collectively, ‘Corporate Defendants’) for agreeing, combining and conspiring to impose, implement, follow and enforce anticompetitive restraints that cause home sellers to pay inflated commissions on the sale of their homes, in violation of federal antitrust law,” the 93-page complaint reads. As in other, similar suits, the now-combined case targets NAR’s Participation Rule, also known as the cooperative compensation rule, which requires listing brokers to offer compensation to buyer brokers in order to submit a listing to a Realtor-affiliated MLS. The consolidated complaint seeks class-action status and asks to represent the following class of millions of homesellers: “All persons in the United States who, from December 27, 2019, through the present, used a listing broker affiliated with any Corporate Defendant in the sale of a home listed on an MLS, and who paid a commission to a cooperating broker in connection with the sale of the home.” However, there are carveouts when it comes to the NAR, Keller Williams and the HomeServices defendants in the Sitzer | Burnett and Moehrl cases as well as a similar case filed against MLS PIN known as Nosalek. Sitzer | Burnett covers four MLS markets in Missouri, Moehrl covers 20 MLS markets nationwide and Nosalek only covers MLS PIN. Therefore, certain home sales in those markets that are already covered by those cases will not be covered in the Gibson class. Michael Ketchmark Michael Ketchmark, lead plaintiffs’ counsel in the Sitzer | Burnett case, told Inman that his team and the Moehrl attorneys had worked so closely together in the last two years that it made sense to “completely join forces” and make Gibson and Umpa a single case. “We’re going to be coordinating discovery, coordinating all aspects of the preparation of both of the cases for trial; that’s what it means,” Ketchmark said. “It’s the uniting of the plaintiffs’ trial teams.” The defendants in the now-expanded Gibson case are numerous, though some have announced proposed nationwide settlements with the plaintiffs, including Realty One Group and @properties, who filed settlement notices with the court on Tuesday. The Gibson defendants now are: According to Ketchmark, any brokerages that do not either join in the National Association of Realtors’ settlement agreement, which includes a mechanism for large brokerages to opt in, or negotiate a separate settlement with the plaintiffs, “will find themselves as defendants.” Read the plaintiffs’ amended consolidated class action complaint: Email Andrea V.

    "published_at": "2024-04-25T05:00:12Z",
    "content": "A federal jury said BNSF Railway contributed to the deaths of two people who were exposed to asbestos decades ago when tainted mining material was shipped through a Montana town where thousands have been sickened. The jury awarded $4 million each in compensatory damages to the estates of the two plaintiffs, who died in 2020. Jurors said asbestos-contaminated vermiculite that spilled in the rail yard in the town of Libby, Montana was a substantial factor in the plaintiffs’ illnesses and deaths. Family members of the two victims hugged their attorneys after the verdict was announced. An attorney for the plaintiffs said the ruling brought some accountability, but one family member told The Associated Press that no amount of money would replace her lost sister. “I’d rather have her than all the money in the world,” Judith Hemphill said of her sister, Joyce Walder. The vermiculite from Libby has high concentrations of naturally-occurring asbestos and was used in insulation and for other commercial purposes in homes and businesses across the U.S. After being mined from a mountaintop outside town, it was loaded onto rail cars that sometimes spilled the material in the Libby rail yard. Residents have described piles of vermiculite being stored in the yard and dust from the facility blowing through downtown Libby. The jury did not find that BNSF acted intentionally or with indifference so no punitive damages were awarded. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. acquired BNSF in 2010, two decades after the W.R. Grace & Co. vermiculite mine near Libby shut down and stopped shipping the contaminated mineral. The estates of the two victims argued that the railroad knew the asbestos-tainted vermiculite was dangerous and failed to clean it up. Both lived near the rail yard decades ago and died from mesothelioma, a rare lung cancer linked to asbestos exposure. The pollution in Libby has been cleaned up, largely at public expense. W.R. Grace, which played a central role in the town’s tragedy, filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and paid $1.8 billion into an asbestos trust fund to settle future cases. Yet the long timeframe over which asbestos-related diseases develop means people previously exposed are likely to continue getting sick for years to come, health officials say. The case in federal civil court over the two deaths was the first of numerous lawsuits against the Texas-based railroad corporation to reach trial over its past operations in Libby. Current and former residents of the small town near the U.S.-Canada border want BNSF held accountable, accusing it of playing a role in asbestos exposure that health officials say has killed several hundred people and sickened thousands. “This is good news. This is the first community exposure case that will hold the railroad accountable for what they’ve done,” said Mark Lanier, an attorney for Walder and Hemphill’s estates. The railroad was considering whether to appeal, said a BNSF spokesperson, who referred to it as a “very sad case.” “They (the jury) had the difficult task of evaluating conduct that occurred more than 50 years ago, before BNSF ever existed,” said Kendall Sloan, the railroad’s director of external communications. BNSF attorney Chad Knight told jurors last week the railroad’s employees didn’t know the vermiculite was filled with hazardous microscopic asbestos fibers. “In the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s no one in the public suspected there might be health concerns,” Knight said Friday. The railroad’s experts also suggested during the trial that the plaintiffs could have been exposed to asbestos elsewhere. The railroad said it was obliged under law to ship the vermiculite, which was used in insulation and for other commercial purposes, and that W.R. Grace employees had concealed the health hazards from the railroad. U.S. District Judge Brian Morris had instructed the jury it could only find the railroad negligent based on its actions in the Libby Railyard, not for hauling the vermiculite. Former Libby resident Bill Johnston, who followed the trial, said he was glad the victims’ estates got a substantial award. Johnston, 67, recalled playing in piles of vermiculite at the rail yard as a child and helping his father add piles of the material to their home garden, where it was used as a soil amendment. He, his two siblings and their parents have all been diagnosed with asbestos-related diseases, Johnston said Monday. “They didn’t do anything intentionally to cause this harm to their body. Other people knew about it and didn’t care,” he said of Libby asbestos victims. “What’s that worth? It’s hard to put a value on that. But when you say you’re going to die prematurely or the life you have left is going to be tethered to an oxygen bottle, there should be some value that makes their life easier in the end.” BNSF was formed in 1995 from the merger of Burlington Northern railroad, which operated in Libby for decades, and the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation. Looming over the proceedings was W.R. Grace, which operated the mountaintop vermiculite mine 7 miles (11 kilometers) outside of Libby until it closed in 1990. Morris referred to the chemical company as “the elephant in the room” during the BNSF trial and reminded jurors repeatedly that the case was about the railroad’s conduct, not W.R. Grace’s separate liability. Federal prosecutors in 2005 indicted W. R. Grace and executives from the company on criminal charges over the contamination in Libby. A jury acquitted them following a 2009 trial. The Environmental Protection Agency descended on Libby after 1999 news reports of illnesses and deaths among mine workers and their families. In 2009 the agency declared in Libby the nation’s first ever public health emergency under the federal Superfund cleanup program. A second trial against the railroad over the death of a Libby resident is scheduled for May in federal court in Missoula. \nTopics\nMontana\n Was this article valuable? Thank you!

    "description": "El contrato con Wilson será multianual. Ya es la pelota oficial de la NBA, la NCAA, todas las competiciones de Fiba 3x3 y la BCL. Spalding aún retiene la Euroliga y otras ligas europeas",
    "published_at": "2024-04-25T03:00:00Z",
    "content": " La ACB jugará con un nuevo balón a partir de la próxima temporada. Concretamente, el mismo que ya usan en la NBA. La liga española de baloncesto ha alcanzado un acuerdo con Wilson, según han podido saber 2Playbook y El Confidencial . Aún se desconocen los detalles económicos y la duración del mismo, aunque sí que será multianual. Este acuerdo supone el aterrizaje de Wilson en una gran liga nacional europea tras lanzar su ofensiva en Estados Unidos hace tres años, firmando con NBA, WNBA, NCAA y con todos los torneos 3x3 de Fiba. En Europa ya estaba también con la Basketball Champions League (BCL) de la Fiba y el de la liga báltica, así como otras fuera del top-10.   El acuerdo, al igual que los anteriores con un proveedor técnico, incluye todas las competiciones: Liga Endesa, Copa del Rey, Supercopa y Minicopa. Se utilizará el mismo modelo de balón que ya se usa en las principales competiciones que patrocina Wilson y, al igual que Spalding hasta ahora, ocupará el rango de proveedor.   Wilson trazó un nuevo plan estratégico con la llegada de la pandemia. El objetivo era recuperar terreno en territorios clave para la firma como el baloncesto, el tenis, pádel o voleibol. La marca pertenece al grupo finlandés Amer Sports, que tras ser comprado por el gigante chino Anta, ha vuelto a salir a Bolsa este año gracias a la fortaleza de marcas como la propia Wilson o también Salomon.   Amer facturó 4.368 millones de dólares (4.098 millones de euros) en 2023, y cerró con unas pérdidas de 208,8 millones de dólares (196 millones de euros). La división de pelotas y raquetas, donde se encasilla Wilson entre otras marcas, creció un 7%, hasta 1.110 millones de dólares (1.039 millones de euros).   Spalding, por su parte, ha ido perdiendo terreno en los últimos años. Es una marca especializada en baloncesto a la que Wilson ya arrebató sus principales contratos en la NBA y, ahora, en la ACB. Spalding había sido el socio tradicional de la liga. A mediados de los noventa Nike se hizo con el contrato, que retuvo hasta 2012, cuando Spalding sustituyó a la marca de Oregón.   Spalding, sin embargo, cambió de manos en julio de 2021. United Sports Brands Europe asumió su distribución y todas las licencias de producto, incluyendo los contratos de patrocinio. Hasta entonces su distribución había estado en manos de Uhlsport. El propietario de Spalding es Berkshire Hathaway, el holding inversor fundado por Warren Buffet.   La firma ha ido perdiendo presencia en Europa de forma paulatina. En España aún mantiene los contratos como socio técnico de Joventut y Gran Canaria. En Europa deberá negociar la renovación con Euroliga, y aún tiene contrato como balón oficial de las ligas francesa, alemana, adriática y lituana.   Solo Molten le supera en número de contratos con ligas y torneos. La marca japonesa es el balón oficial de las grandes citas del baloncesto: Juegos Olímpicos, Mundiales y Eurobasket, gracias a su acuerdo con Fiba. También lo usan en la Liga Femenina Endesa, la Euroliga femenina (gestionada por Fiba Europa), y las ligas griega, italiana y turca, entre otras.   *Artículo publicado originalmente en 2Playbook.com   La ACB jugará con un nuevo balón a partir de la próxima temporada.

Over 15 years, the study also found that 12% of all inventions were published for clean and sustainable technologies. EPO President António Campinos said, “while it’s encouraging to see inventors in the EU leading the way in patenting green technologies, it’s vital that the global IP landscape continues to deepen its collaboration.” In total, from 2017 to 2021, EPO member states accounted for 27% of all high-value cleantech inventions worldwide. GSK Accuses Pfizer of Infringing on mRNA Patent On Thursday, April 25, GlaxoSmithKline filed a lawsuit against Pfizer and BioNTech accusing the companies of infringing on several patents related to mRNA technology used in COVID-19 vaccines.

Julie Burke. Let me correct you: the SAWS program has not come out of retirement. It’s even worse. When the USPTO was caught with their hands in the cookie jar (the Office refusing comment, but MANY in the blogosphere abjectly denying the existence of SAWS – untiL too many ‘oopsie’s’ made the existence no longer deniable, and the Office had to act, they posted the nonsense spin of “we do not think this is working/this only affected far too few applications, so we are retiring SAWS.” The problem with their spin is that they revealed TOO MUCH: they admitted that SAWS was but one of many such programs. How many other programs?\nWhy are the others remaining shrouded in the shadows?\nHow do ANY of these comport with the Rule of Law of 37 CFR 1.2 -which binds the Office to ONLY evaluate patent applications on the written record? yep, Pro Say, meanwhile the SAWS program seems to have come out of retirement and America’s Innovation Agency continues to give Chinese entities a leg up in obtaining IP coverage for clearly military-intended technologies https://www.linkedin.com/posts/julie-burke-492264120_erection-device-and-method-for-marine-hot-activity-7190099432028229632-vW7u?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop “the USPTO hosted an event on Capitol Hill” Well, would you just lookie there. No sign of Molly Metz or any of the more than 100 other inventors and inventive small companies who’ve had their PATENTED inventions ripped from their hands by the Death Squad PTAB and given away for free to the infringers. Guess that wouldn’t be a great look, would it, Vidal, Biden, and Congress. No; not a good look at all. The fact is that these innovation-stealing PTAB goons are worse than all the organized retail gangs we watch on TV (combined); rampage-stealing from inventors here, there, and everywhere. Far worse. “China Leads the Pack in AI Patents Granted” While Congress slumbers, China’s patented innovation lead grows ever larger. Your email address will not be published.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Things People Waste the Most Money On. While people raise concerns about inflation and their ability to save, they overlook the amount of money wasted that could have been invested or saved. According to a report by the Federal Reserve Board, the overall financial well-being of an average adult in the US declined by 5% from 2021 to 2022. As per the survey, 73% of the adults reported being at least okay financially in 2022. Moreover, 35% of adults reported being financially worse off than the previous year. Some of the prominent things people waste the most money on in the US include food, dining out, alcohol, and impulse buying. One of our recent articles on the 20 Countries That Waste the Most Food discussed how the United States of America is one of the top countries to waste the most food, wasting approximately 19.3 million tons per year. According to a survey conducted by Cherry Digital, a communications agency, American households waste an average of $907 annually. Looking at a state-wise analysis, even the least wasteful state, West Virginia, was recorded to waste food worth $405 per household annually. Moreover, according to the survey, households in South Carolina were wasting approximately $1,305 worth of food each year. In addition to the money wasted on food, Americans spend extensively on dining out. The Economic Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture found that for a typical dollar spent on food in the US, 34.1% accounted for restaurants and dining-out services in 2022. Moreover, 12.4% of the remainder of the food dollar went to retail trade. Alcohol consumption rates are high in the US. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAA), approximately 172.7 million adults aged 18 or above reported drinking during 2021. This amounted to approximately 67.4% of people in the age group. While drinking has adverse effects on health, it is not pocket-friendly either. The American Addiction Center, while addressing the cost of alcohol, found that even the drinking habit of 1 glass a day costs, on average, $1,456 per year, whereas consuming a bottle a day can cost up to $607 a month and $7,280 a year. In addition to the first-hand cost of drinking, there are various hidden costs associated with the habit. For instance, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the US economy lost approximately $179 billion due to an alcohol-related decrease in productivity in 2019.

Buying a new car is one of the 20 things people waste the most money on. Despite being very expensive, a new car loses significant value within the first few years of ownership.

    "content": "HomeServices of America, a real estate brokerage owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., reached a settlement agreement in a lawsuit taking aim at agent commissions industrywide.  The brokerage agreed to pay a total of $250 million over the course of four years in its settlement of the Missouri lawsuit, commonly referred to as Sitzer and Burnett, according to HomeServices of America Executive Vice President Chris Kelly. The company said the settlement, subject to court approval, will help protect its agents from related lawsuits.  “While we have always been confident in the legality and ethics of our business practices, the decision to settle was driven by a desire to eliminate the uncertainty brought by the protracted appellate and litigation process,” Kelly said in an emailed statement. The real estate industry, including the National Association of Realtors, has come under scrutiny recently through multiple lawsuits that have taken aim at how commissions are structured. Last year, a Missouri jury found the Realtor group and others liable of colluding to keep real estate agent commissions high in a $1.8 billion verdict in the Sitzer and Burnett lawsuit. The NAR agreed in March to settle litigation in the case, as well as other pending lawsuits. Other brokerages including Compass Inc. have also agreed to settlements. “This resolution allows us to concentrate on our primary goal: delivering unparalleled value in the real estate market and serving homebuyers and sellers with the highest standards of service,” Kelly said. The financial terms of the settlement are the sole obligation of HomeServices with no participation from its parent company.

She resigned in October of last year, in part because the Marlins wanted to hire a president of baseball operations above her, according to ESPN.  Ng and Markward sold the 3,400-square-foot Coconut Grove house for its asking price of $4.5 million, 40 percent more than their purchase price in 2021. The deed naming the buyer has not yet been recorded. The sellers renovated the home, including a new kitchen and flooring, according to the listing.  They paid $3.2 million for the four-bedroom, four-and-a-half home the same year it was completed. It sits on a quarter-acre lot.  Gina Gardner of Engel & Völkers brought the buyer. Monica Betancourt of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty represented the sellers, according to Realtor.com. Betancourt also represented the couple when they bought the house three years ago.  Ng isn’t the only sports celebrity to own a home in Coconut Grove.  Late last year, NBA All-Star Kevin Love, a power forward for the Miami Heat, and his wife, Kate, paid $9.5 million for a spec home just northeast of Main Highway. Los Angeles Laker and ex-Miami Heat star player LeBron James’ former Coconut Grove mansion recently re-traded for $18.5 million.

    "content": "A real estate company owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to pay $250 million to settle lawsuits nationwide LOS ANGELES -- A real estate company owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to pay $250 million to settle lawsuits nationwide claiming that longstanding practices by real estate brokerages forced U.S. homeowners to pay artificially inflated broker commissions when they sold their homes. HomeServices of America said Friday that the proposed settlement would shield its 51 brands, nearly 70,000 real estate agents and over 300 franchisees from similar litigation.  The real estate company had been a major holdout after several other big brokerage operators, including Keller Williams Realty, Re/Max, Compass and Anywhere Real Estate, agreed to settle. Last month, the National Association of Realtors agreed to pay $418 million. “While we have always been confident in the legality and ethics of our business practices, the decision to settle was driven by a desire to eliminate the uncertainty brought by the protracted appellate and litigation process,” the company said in a statement. HomeServices said its proposed settlement payout represents a current after-tax accounting charge of about $140 million, though it will have four years to pay the full amount. The real estate company also noted that its parent company is not part of the settlement. Buffett said in February in his annual letter to shareholders that Berkshire had $167.6 billion cash on hand at the end of last year. That makes Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, Nebraska, an attractive target for litigation, but the company largely lets its subsidiaries run themselves and doesn’t directly intervene in litigation involving its many companies, which include Geico insurance, BNSF railroad and See’s Candy. Including HomeServices' proposed payout, the real estate industry has now agreed to pay more than $943 million to make the lawsuits go away. “This is another significant settlement for American home sellers who have been saddled with paying billions in unnecessary commission costs,\" Benjamin Brown, managing partner at one of the law firms that represented plaintiffs in a case filed in Illinois, said in a statement.  The lawsuits' central claim is that the country’s biggest real estate brokerages and the NAR violated antitrust laws by engaging in business practices that required home sellers to pay the fees for the broker representing the buyer. Attorneys representing home sellers in multiple states argued that homeowners who listed a property for sale on real estate industry databases were required to include a compensation offer for an agent representing a buyer. And that not including such “cooperative compensation” offers might lead a buyer’s agent to steer their client away from any seller’s listing that didn’t include such an offer.  In October, a federal jury in Missouri ordered that HomeServices, the National Association of Realtors and several other large real estate brokerages pay nearly $1.8 billion in damages. The defendants were facing potentially having to pay more than $5 billion, if treble damages were awarded. The verdict in that case, which was filed in 2019 on behalf of 500,000 home sellers in Missouri and elsewhere, led to multiple similar lawsuits being filed against the real estate brokerage industry. The major brokerages that have reached proposed settlements in these cases have also agreed to change their business practices to ensure homebuyers and sellers can more easily understand how brokers and agents are compensated for their services, and that brokers and agents who represent homebuyers must disclose right away any offer of compensation by the broker representing a seller. HomeServices said it also agreed to make “substantially similar new or amended business practice changes that have been included in the other corporate defendant settlement agreements,” said Chris Kelly, a HomeServices spokesperson. NAR also agreed to make several policy changes, including prohibiting brokers who list a home for sale on any of the databases affiliated with the NAR from including offers of compensation for a buyer’s representative. The new rules, which are set to go into effect in July, represent a major change to the way real estate agents have operated going back to the 1990s. While many housing market watchers say it’s too soon to tell how the policy changes will affect home sales, they could lead to home sellers paying lower commissions for their broker's services. Buyers, in turn, may have to shoulder more upfront costs when they hire an agent to represent them. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

''This is another significant settlement for American home sellers who have been saddled with paying billions in unnecessary commission costs,\" Benjamin Brown, managing partner at one of the law firms that represented plaintiffs in a case filed in Illinois, said in a statement. The lawsuits' central claim is that the country's biggest real estate brokerages and the NAR violated antitrust laws by engaging in business practices that required home sellers to pay the fees for the broker representing the buyer. Attorneys representing home sellers in multiple states argued that homeowners who listed a property for sale on real estate industry databases were required to include a compensation offer for an agent representing a buyer. And that not including such ''cooperative compensation'' offers might lead a buyer's agent to steer their client away from any seller's listing that didn't include such an offer. In October, a federal jury in Missouri ordered that HomeServices, the National Association of Realtors and several other large real estate brokerages pay nearly $1.8 billion in damages. The defendants were facing potentially having to pay more than $5 billion, if treble damages were awarded. The verdict in that case, which was filed in 2019 on behalf of 500,000 home sellers in Missouri and elsewhere, led to multiple similar lawsuits being filed against the real estate brokerage industry. The major brokerages that have reached proposed settlements in these cases have also agreed to change their business practices to ensure homebuyers and sellers can more easily understand how brokers and agents are compensated for their services, and that brokers and agents who represent homebuyers must disclose right away any offer of compensation by the broker representing a seller. HomeServices said it also agreed to make ''substantially similar new or amended business practice changes that have been included in the other corporate defendant settlement agreements,'' said Chris Kelly, a HomeServices spokesperson. NAR also agreed to make several policy changes, including prohibiting brokers who list a home for sale on any of the databases affiliated with the NAR from including offers of compensation for a buyer's representative. The new rules, which are set to go into effect in July, represent a major change to the way real estate agents have operated going back to the 1990s. While many housing market watchers say it's too soon to tell how the policy changes will affect home sales, they could lead to home sellers paying lower commissions for their broker's services. Buyers, in turn, may have to shoulder more upfront costs when they hire an agent to represent them. © 2024 StarTribune. All rights reserved."

    "content": "\n\t\tThanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.\t A real estate brokerage owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway said Friday it reached a $250 million settlement of nationwide antitrust litigation that is expected to change how real estate agents are paid. HomeServices of America, the largest US real estate brokerage, was the last remaining defendant in a case against the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and four brokerages. Its settlement would eliminate the risk of a much higher payout, after a jury in Kansas City, Mo., in October sided with home sellers who accused the industry of conspiring to keep real estate commissions in that state artificially high. Jurors awarded $1.78 billion of damages, which a judge could have tripled. HomeServices’ settlement requires court approval.  Lawyers for the plaintiff sellers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The NAR agreed to settle nationwide antitrust litigation for $418 million last month, and won a judge’s preliminary approval on Tuesday. It also agreed to rewrite rules for paying buyers’ and sellers’ agents. Analysts said the changes could lower commissions by at least 25%. With the latest settlement, the NAR and brokerages including HomeServices Anywhere Real Estate and Re/Max would pay more than $943 million to resolve antitrust claims. Berkshire Hathaway owns 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which owns HomeServices as well as a variety of utilities, pipelines and renewable energy projects. HomeServices spokesperson Chris Kelly said the brokerage’s settlement represents “a sole obligation of HomeServices, with no participation by any parent entity,” and will result in a $140 million after-tax accounting charge. Berkshire Hathaway Energy remains a defendant in a similar Kansas City case against several brokerages. Lawyers for plaintiffs there did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Buffett’s conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, ended 2023 with $167.6 billion of cash and equivalents."

Inman Connect At Inman Connect Las Vegas, July 30-Aug. 1, 2024, the noise and misinformation will be banished, all your big questions will be answered, and new business opportunities will be revealed. Join us. Inman’s “Anatomy of a Deal” is an occasional feature that examines the twists and turns behind agents’ remarkable transactions. Read the most recent Anatomy of a Deal coverage here. Moving property in LA’s luxury market isn’t what it used to be. Higher mortgage rates coupled with the enactment of the ULA tax on properties priced $5 million or more, and general economic uncertainty, slowed transactions down significantly at the luxury level in LA in the last year. That’s why, when a home asking $5.995 million gets six offers — with the winning bid at $705,000 above asking — it bears noticing. TAKE THE INMAN INTEL INDEX SURVEY FOR APRIL Agents Claire and Sam O’Connor of O’Connor Estates at Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties recently pulled off just such a deal and came away with some very happy clients in the process. Before the O’Connor sisters stepped in, the property at 9455 Lloydcrest Drive had sat on the market for nearly one year. However, after they listed it a second time around, it was pending within 15 days. A remodel, strategic pricing, choice photos, an offer deadline and strong agent relationships helped the team of sisters succeed with what was once a tough sell.    Sam and Claire O’Connor | Credit: Reid Anderson O’Connor Estates represented design firm and developer House of Rolison and a team of investors who acquired the property at Lloydcrest Drive with the goal of flipping it. Claire and Sam thought the five-bedroom, six-bathroom home presented the perfect opportunity for investment with an older design scheme and about 800 square feet of unpermitted space that, as of yet, had been untapped. One of the biggest visible transformations was to the exterior of the home. Previously, the home was in a Dutch Colonial style. House of Rolison opted to add stucco to the exterior and Spanish tiles to give it a more Mediterranean look. But instead of going with the classic, clean white stucco, they opted to paint it a sleek black, which helped it to blend in with the surrounding scenery seamlessly. “It’s something that’s different,” Claire O’Connor told Inman. “And with the orientation of the house, there are all these beautiful trees all around it. And with the color that they chose, it feels very hidden — like a hidden tree house.” House of Rolison took over design of the interior as well, upgrading all finishes and reorganizing the layout, working with a staging team to give shape to the previously untapped square footage, which is currently undergoing approval to be used as an ADU since it includes space for a bathroom, closet and kitchen. 9455 Lloydcrest Drive | Credit: Nils Timm When it came to pricing, the O’Connor sisters knew they had to get it just right with factors like higher mortgage rates and the ULA Tax already serving to dissuade consumers from jumping into the market. One factor that worked in the sisters’ favor — through no action of their own — was the fact that the property is located so close in proximity to the City of Beverly Hills, while still technically located within the City of Los Angeles where the ULA Tax is enforced. Potential buyers who had been targeting Beverly Hills saw the property come up in their search, potentially not realizing that the seller in the transaction would be taxed an additional 4 percent. Of course, this would not impact the buyer initially, but would impact them in their own future sale of the property, hopefully years down the line, when they would incur the tax themselves. In order for the sellers to break even with the tax, and for the property to still populate in searches on homes under $6 million, the O’Connor sisters, therefore, went with the aggressive pricing of $5.995 million, thinking it would just sneak in under that $6 million threshold. “A lot of people are looking at Zillow and Redfin and they’re setting their own filters and some people are just doing it for fun, but a lot of really active buyers are looking that way as well,” Claire said. “And they’re getting emails from these services, so I think in pivoting to this type of market, it makes sense to price right under the price filters on those services. So we generally always do that and it’s worked well for us, and in this instance, the comps really supported the price.” Credit: Nils Timm Since nearly everyone browses real estate listings online these days before speaking to their agent, the O’Connor sisters were well-aware that making sure they had the best possible photos up online was crucial. Claire had heard at an industry conference that leading a listing with an exterior twilight shot was linked to higher click-through rates than other types of photos by a significant margin, so the sisters thought they’d give the strategy a try. “I think a lot of times, people think that an interior shot means the exterior is ugly or something because it’s so ubiquitous that people have the exterior shot as their first shot,” Claire said. “But it was definitely a really hard decision because the interior shots are so beautiful [too].” The O’Connor sisters attribute the listing photos shot by Nils Timm as one of the reasons they saw over 100 people come through their open house the first weekend the home was listed and more than 10,000 views and saves of the property on Zillow. Great photos, paired with pricing and design, also helped the property go viral when the sisters shared it on social media. The O’Connor sisters shared the property with their roughly 25,000 Instagram followers in different posts that highlighted the different rooms of the home. “We highlighted different rooms in each post, rather than something like, ‘Here are all the photos in one post,'” Sam O’Connor explained. “It was like, ‘Here are the outdoor spaces,’ ‘Here’s the kitchen,’ and it got a lot of engagement and reaction from people.” After they held a brokers open, where they allowed other brokers to also shoot photos and videos of the property, the sisters started seeing the listing show up on other people’s social accounts too, which “was really cool to see.” 9455 Lloydcrest Drive | Credit: Nils Timm Once it became apparent that the sisters’ had garnered a fair amount of attention on Lloydcrest Drive — “As soon as we went live, both our phones started ringing off the hook,” Sam said — it seemed appropriate to consider a deadline for all best and final offers. However, the slower pace of the market in recent months had heretofore largely eliminated offer deadlines from the equation. “Initially, we were like, ‘I don’t know if we want to do an offer deadline,'” Sam said. “They always kind of scare us a little bit because people get flighty and they don’t want to compete. But we felt so confident after three days on the market that that’s what we were going to have to do.” Because of demand, the sisters actually held a total of five open houses over the course of about a week-and-a-half and then decided to make the offer deadline for 11 days after the first open house, on a Monday evening. They ended up receiving a total of six offers, five of which were all-cash. Credit: Nils Timm At a time when the value of buyer agents is being questioned, the O’Connor sisters noted that there was a palpable difference between buyers who showed up with experienced agents and those who showed up with agents who either didn’t have the chops or were taking the job less seriously. “Buyers that work with really sophisticated agents, those were the ones that showed up and were really strong competitors,” Claire said. “Buyers who were working with weaker agents or a friend of a friend of a friend, or almost self-representing, they were wanting like $1 million off [the list price].” Added Sam, “I find it really interesting in light of the NAR settlement — there is a difference in working with a strong buyer’s agent and a weak buyer’s agent. The people who were well-represented had a strong shot at actually getting the house that they want, and the people who weren’t were sort of in a fantasy world.” The O’Connor sisters also saw a noticeable correlation between offer quality, agent experience and their interpersonal skills. The seasoned agents made a concerted effort to develop good rapport with Sam and Claire, and in doing so, they were better informed about the sellers and what would make a compelling offer. “We know to have a strong agent in your corner is a plus, obviously,” Sam said. “But even with speaking with other agents that are representing their clients, I feel like there was a lot of respect with the good, seasoned agents we spoke with and a lot of very weird behaviors in the agents that didn’t do a good job of representing their clients … We represented [the listing] well, and then we had really good relationships with the top three contenders.

    "title": "Warren Buffett’s Real Estate Company Will Pay $250 Million In Antitrust Settlement",

    "content": "HomeServices of America, Warren Buffett’s real estate brokerage, reached a $250 million settlement over allegations it kept fees artificially high—marking the last major company to settle in the landmark antitrust case against the real estate industry. The $250 million settlement from HomeServices of America is reportedly the highest amount a real ... [+] estate brokerage has agreed to pay to settle antitrust claims. Chris Kelly, executive vice president of HomeServices of America, told Forbes in a statement the settlement “underscores our commitment to protecting our agents, employees, and franchisees” by protecting them from related lawsuits. Kelly said the brokerage has “always been confident in the legality and ethics of” its business practices and “the decision to settle was driven by a desire to eliminate the uncertainty brought by the protracted appellate and litigation process.” Benjamin D. Brown, managing partner at Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll—which represented the plaintiffs in the case—said the “significant settlement” brings them “a step closer to resolving this long-running case involving the industry-wide brokers’ commission scheme.” The National Association of Realtors, HomeServices, and a number of other major brokerages were sued in 2019 by groups of home sellers who alleged they were paying oversized fees to brokers and agents. HomeServices is a subsidiary of Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and the $250 million settlement is the highest amount any brokerage has paid to settle suits over the industry’s commission structure, the Wall Street Journal reported. Despite the high settlement figure, plaintiffs who tried to tie the suit to Berkshire Hathaway Energy to improve their payouts had hoped for more, according to multiple reports. $418 million. That’s how much the National Association of Realtors will pay in settlement fees over the next four years to end litigation with home sellers who sued over broker commissions and fees. As part of the settlement, the association also said agents for home sellers will no longer be required to give commission to buyers’ agents, changing the way homes are sold. The NAR settlement was announced last month and got preliminary approval from a judge earlier this week. In October, a Missouri jury found home sellers had been paying inflated fees to their real estate agents and the verdict ordered damages of at least $1.8 billion from NAR, HomeServices of America and one other brokerage. Two other brokerages named in the suit settled out of court for about $140 million, CNN reported. Though NAR recently settled a number of lawsuits over the heightened fees, the association continued to deny any wrongdoing related to its compensation model. In court, the association argued it didn’t have a conspiracy around commissions and that allegations of set commission rates were unfounded, the New York Times reported. Other legal troubles for the NAR. Earlier this month, the Department of Justice announced it was reopening its investigation into the association. “The Antitrust Division is committed to fighting to lower the cost of buying and selling a home,” Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter said in a statement on April 5.

He detailed one avenue where AI has recently outperformed human professionals: investing in the stock market. Check Out: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or AmazonRead Next: 6 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money He showed viewers three ways ChatGPT can help — and pointed out some of the shortcomings of using artificial intelligence for investing. Sponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity. One group in the United Kingdom asked ChatGPT to create a portfolio of stocks from high-quality businesses, with criteria taken from 10 leading funds. Between March 6 and April 28 of 2023, Stephan said, the portfolio of 38 stocks gained 4.9%, while 10 leading investment funds lost an average of 0.8%, according to Finder.com. However, Stephan pointed out, “Fund managers aren’t exactly the crème de la crème to be competing against.” In past examples, monkeys and cats were shown to pick stocks that outperformed investment funds (though outliers don’t always disprove the rule). In a project called The ChatGPT Challenge, however, the AI platform selected 20 stocks — including blue chip names like Berkshire Hathaway, Google, Amazon, and Apple — and tracked their performance. “On the first day, it was already beating the S&P 500,” Stephan told viewers. “It’s too early to tell how this is going to pan out.” Learn More: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire — 5 Stocks You Shouldn’t Sell In another experiment, someone created a ChatGPT prompt to analyze news reports for negative, positive and neutral sentiments surrounding top companies. “What it found was that ChatGPT was actually good at predicting what stock prices were actually going to fall the most,” Stephan said. Negative articles yielded the largest immediate downward movement in stock prices. This information provided a selection of stocks that you could short, or bet against, for potential profit. Shorting stocks carries substantial market risk, however, and is mostly a tactic used by institutional investors, according to GOBankingRates. If you aren’t ready to rely on an AI model to build your portfolio, you can consider using an AI-powered investment platform like Magnifi, which claims to provide personalized, data-driven investment advice. These platforms can take the emotion out of stock picks, which can lead to smarter investment decisions. However, as Stephan pointed out in the video: “It’s the human factor that makes investing what it is.” Stephan closed the video with a dose of common sense, recommending an S&P 500 index fund for most investors. “It’s boring, unsexy, and basic, but so far it’s worked for those who have held long-term.” However, ChatGPT does have its place in the world of finance, according to Stephan. “I do believe ChatGPT will be incredibly useful for simplifying information and making it much more digestible for the average investor who doesn’t have time to read earning reports, charts, and graphs,” he said. Whether that translates to increased profits depends on what you choose to do with that information.

    "content": "\nView Digital Edition \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApril 26, 2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Associated Press\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n BNSF will become the second major freight railroad to allow some of its employees to report safety concerns anonymously through a federal system without fear of discipline. The Federal Railroad Administration announced Thursday that the railroad owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway had agreed to let its roughly 650 dispatchers participate in the program that all the major railroads promised to join after last year’s disastrous Norfolk Southern derailment in Ohio. “Rail workers deserve to know they’re safe when they’re on the job — and if they experience anything that compromises their safety, they should be able to report it without worrying if their job is in jeopardy,” said Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Buttigieg has been urging the railroads to improve safety ever since the February 2023 derailment. “We hope this program will further empower our employees to provide confidential feedback on critical safety issues in an actionable, timely manner,” BNSF CEO Katie Farmer said. Until NS became the first railroad to sign onto the anonymous reporting system in January, all the major freight railroads resisted joining because they wanted the ability to discipline workers who use the hotline in certain circumstances. The Association of American Railroads trade group has said railroads were worried that the system could be abused by workers who try to avoid discipline by reporting situations a railroad already knows about. But the idea of disciplining workers who report safety concerns undermines the entire purpose of such a hotline because workers won’t use it if they fear retribution, unions and workplace safety experts said. That’s especially important on the railroads where there is a long history of workers being fired for reporting safety violations or injuries. The president of the American Train Dispatchers Association, Ed Dowell, said this move “marks a pivotal moment for rail safety.” “As a program focused on proactive safety measures, it will serve as the new standard for reporting, understanding, and preventing rail incidents,” Dowell said. The Norfolk Southern program is also limited in scope. Only about 1,000 members of the two unions representing engineers and conductors who work in three locations on that railroad can participate. Besides Norfolk Southern and now BNSF, only Amtrak and several dozen small railroads use the government reporting program. The big railroads — that also include Union Pacific, CSX, CPKC and Canadian National — all already have their own internal safety reporting hotlines. But railroad unions have consistently said workers are reluctant to use the railroads’ own safety hotlines because they fear retribution. “Let’s be perfectly clear, railroads remain committed to joining the program and creating an additional trusted avenue for employees to report potential safety concerns,” said Association of American Railroads spokeswoman Jessica Kahanek. FRA Administrator Amit Bose said it’s crucial to have a way for rail workers to use their experience and expertise to raise safety concerns that the railroads can address proactively. Δ"

Inman Connect At Inman Connect Las Vegas, July 30-Aug. 1 2024, the noise and misinformation will be banished, all your big questions will be answered, and new business opportunities will be revealed. Join us. HomeServices of America, among the largest real estate brokerages in the nation, will pay $250 million and enact changes to its business practices as part of an agreement to settle lawsuits that posed an ongoing threat to the firm. HomeServices is the last major brokerage named in the landmark Sitzer | Burnett class action lawsuit to reach a settlement agreement, following Anywhere Real Estate and RE/MAX in September, Keller Williams in February and the National Association of Realtors last month. The firm, which is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, notified the court of its proposed settlement, according to Chris Kelly, HomeServices’ executive vice president, though nothing is listed on the court docket as of Friday morning. The settlement agreement is a significant departure for HomeServices, which had vowed to continue its legal fight against the homeseller plaintiffs who alleged it took part in an illegal conspiracy to keep commissions high. TAKE THE INMAN INTEL INDEX SURVEY FOR APRIL Kelly said the settlement showed HomeServices was committed to protecting its agents, employees and franchisees. “This settlement, subject to court approval, will protect our nearly 70,000 agents, 51 brands and over 300 franchisees and licensees from related lawsuits,” Kelly said. “The financial terms of the settlement represent a sole obligation of HomeServices, with no participation by any parent entity, to effectively conclude our involvement in the anti-trust litigation.” Still, the settlement was largely expected by industry insiders. Michael Ketchmark, the lead plaintiffs’ attorney in the Sitzer | Burnett case, told Inman he’s been in frequent and ongoing settlement discussions with real estate defendants that weren’t covered by NAR’s March 15 settlement. NAR’s settlement agreement offered protection to brokerages that conducted less than $2 billion in sales volume in 2022. The agreement also created a pathway for the remaining 90 or so brokerages that haven’t yet settled and weren’t covered by the settlement agreement. The stakes were immensely high for HomeServices, which was potentially on the hook for the remaining $4.7 billion in damages from an Oct. 31 jury verdict in Sitzer | Burnett, which awarded plaintiffs $5.3 billion. The jury awarded $1.78 billion, an amount that automatically triples. “While we have always been confident in the legality and ethics of our business practices, the decision to settle was driven by a desire to eliminate the uncertainty brought by the protracted appellate and litigation process,” Kelly said. “This resolution allows us to concentrate on our primary goal: delivering unparalleled value in the real estate market and serving home buyers and sellers with the highest standards of service.” Its $250 million settlement amount brings the total damages from the Sitzer | Burnett lawsuit to $876.5 million, including $418 million from NAR, $70 million from Keller Williams, $55 million from RE/MAX and $83.5 million from Anywhere. HomeServices’ brokers conducted $165.7 billion in sales volume in 2022, second only to Compass, which wasn’t named in the Sitzer | Burnett lawsuit. Compass was named in other cases known as Umpa and Gibson. It reached its own settlement agreement last month and agreed to pay $57.5 million. “These settlements will return hundreds of millions of dollars to home sellers and empower both sellers and buyers in the real estate negotiation process,” said Robert A. Braun, a partner at the law firm Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, which represented plaintiffs in a case known as Moehrl. “This is one of the most important transactions in a person’s lifetime.

    "title": "These Homes By Big-Name Architects Just Hit The Market—With Curved Walls And Built-In Furniture (Photos)",
    "description": "Houses designed by award-winning architects like Frank Lloyd Wright can command high asking prices—but don’t expect them to sell any time soon.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-26T12:30:00Z",
    "content": "Two homes designed by celebrated architects Eric Owen Moss and Marcel Breuer recently went up for sale in Los Angeles and New York, joining a small class of pricey houses on the market designed by those who’ve also lent their talents to museums, cathedrals and government buildings across the world—but they may take awhile to sell. Architect Eric Owen Moss designed this $10.9 million home in Los Angeles.  After a years-long restoration, a concrete home designed by Moss, whose other works includes the Patent Office Building in Washington D.C. and Queens Museum of Art, has re-listed for sale in Los Angeles at a reduced price of $10.95 million. On the opposite side of the country, a Hudson Valley home from Marcel Breuer, the original designer of the Wassily Chair, was listed for $1.8 million on Friday. The homes are joined on the market by those designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, Cliff May, Louis Naidorf and Ricardo Legorreta, the first ever Latin winner of the American Institute of Architects’ Gold Medal. While homes designed by famous architects aren't listed for sale often, they tend to outperform the market when they do sell, according to 2016 data from Realtor.com: At the time of that report, Wright and Breuer's designs tended to sell for a 52% and 66% premium over other houses in their area, respectively, with postmodern architect Philip Johnson as the most sought-after designer for American homes, selling at a149% premium. The homes currently on the market by big-name architects range in price from less than $2 million to almost $50 million. Real estate agent Deanna Peters says it can be hard to sell a home that is both high-dollar and has a prestigious history, so much so that Peters has opened a famous Frank Lloyd Wright home in Phoenix (listed for $8.9 million) up to a fractional sale that could see six different people each pay $1.25 million to own it as a group. “I do believe that there exists a group of people who can work together as adults and as investors to create a really great property. Sometimes you have to get creative,” said Peters, who has explored ways to update the Wright-designed Norman Lykes House. She says she’s looked into having an exclusive documentary made about Wright with Volumedia and offered to work as a project manager for owners looking to use the property as an “experience” rental. “The market value of a house like this may be slightly lower than the asking price, but people who really love a Frank Lloyd Wright house won’t care,” Peters said of the Norman Lykes House. “For the right person, the money will mean nothing, but yes it can be challenging to sell a house at this price point and they can stay on the market for quite a while.\" A home designed by Ricardo Legorreta is listed for $47 million in the Brentwood Circle neighborhood of L.A. Listed by Hollywood producer Joel Silver, known for his work in films like \"Road House\" and \"Predator,\" the 25,000-square-foot home includes eight bedrooms and 10 bathrooms. Its unique features designed by the Mexican architect include an atrium entrance, reflection pool, library, gym, sauna and movie theater.

A 1950s home built in Southern New York by Marcel Breuer, one of the famed Harvard Five group of architects and an AIA Gold Medal recipient, is on the market for $1.8 million. The current owners added a one-story office at the end of the original house that brings the home's current square footage to 2,292 with three bedrooms, a distinctive butterfly roof and original bluestone flooring. $11.55 million. That's how much a 4,700-square-foot home designed by architect Joseph Esherick sold for in April after the former owner received a sight-unseen offer, according to Sotheby’s International Realty. The house is a four-bedroom, four-bath dwelling across the street from Presidio National Park and represents the third most-expensive single-family home sold in San Francisco so far this year. Sometimes, all it takes is a famous designer’s touch in one room to make a listing stand out. A house in Miami Beach that sold for $36 million last year included a bathroom designed by Zaha Hadid—a famed architect and personal friend of the sellers. Called the \"crown jewel\" of the house by the Wall Street Journal, the bathroom's unique design included a curved shower and bathtub that stretched the expansive length of the wall. Seller and real estate developer Craig Robbins called Hadid's design contribution \"the nicest thing that probably any friend has ever done for me.\" A gutted mansion designed by architect-to-the-stars Tadao Ando has been listed in Malibu by Kanye West. The musician bought the home for $57.3 million in 2021 before ripping out its windows, doors, electrical and plumbing systems, then abandoning his planned renovation. The 4,000-square-foot home is now on the market for $39 million and would need several million dollars worth of work to be livable. "

Nothing helps do that better than geographic farming. Inman Connect At Inman Connect Las Vegas, July 30-Aug. 1, 2024, the noise and misinformation will be banished, all your big questions will be answered, and new business opportunities will be revealed. Join us. When change happens, the key to success is to find the most effective strategy possible that will generate results and execute on it. The time-tested strategy of geographical farming worked in the past, is working now, and will continue to work in the future.  In this article, I’ll share the step-by-step blueprint for success that will develop a consistent flow of listing opportunities for your business. Success or failure through geographical farming is determined early on by choosing the best area to farm. The first question you should ask is whether there is a dominant agent in the neighborhood. I determine this by totaling the number of listings closed in the past 12 months and the current active listings. TAKE THE INMAN INTEL INDEX SURVEY FOR APRIL I prefer to start a new farm in a neighborhood where there isn’t any one agent who has active listings or sold listings from the previous 12 months that exceed 10 percent of the total listing opportunities for the neighborhood. If you find a neighborhood like this, you have identified one that is ripe for your marketing to make you the dominant agent for that area over the next 12 months. If there is someone who has between 10 percent and 20 percent of the sold and currently active listings, then the neighborhood still has potential for you to farm, but make sure you know where your breakeven number is for the investment you will be making. Finding the perfect farm area involves not just finding a neighborhood you love, but also identifying one that provides an opportunity for you to add money to your bottom line. Consistency is key to becoming the dominant agent for your area, so we want to start with a 12-month commitment to marketing to the neighborhood. I like to use a budgeted amount of $2 per month per home or $24 per home for the year. I will go into what these expenses will be shortly, but for now, let’s see where our breakeven point will be.  For this example, let’s assume we have 400 homes in the neighborhood. The $24 per home, per year budget multiplied by 400 homes means we will have an estimated expenditure for the year of $9,600. If the average sales price in the neighborhood is $400,000 and your listing side commission is 3 percent, then you could anticipate an average listing side gross commission rate of $12,000. If you have an 80 percent split with your brokerage, then your net proceeds after the split would be $9,600. Meaning, for this example, you would need to list and sell one home in the neighborhood during the year to break even. I also like to evaluate the opportunity in the neighborhood. If the average homeowner stays in a home for 11 years, then that means the neighborhood should have roughly 9 percent of the homes in the neighborhood selling each year. Based on 400 homes in the neighborhood, this means we can anticipate roughly 36 homes in an average year being listed and sold. If you execute on the marketing in the following section, you should be able to list over 10 percent of the available listings in a neighborhood over the next 12 months. That means the estimated minimum results you should expect for this farm would be to list 4 homes in the coming year.  If we are being conservative and say you only sell three of the four homes you list, then based on our average net commission from above, this means your $9,600 budgeted expense for the year would generate $28,800 ($9,600 average net commission times three homes sold) or a net income amount of $19,200. With the breakeven point of one sale, no dominant agent in the neighborhood, and a conservative expectation of listing 10 percent of the available listings, generating a return of $19,200, this appears to be a farm area with a lot of upside potential. The marketing plan for the neighborhood will determine whether the farming efforts are successful or not. Remember that we budgeted for $2 per home per month. The consistency of monthly, at a minimum, mailers to the neighborhood is foundational to your success. The monthly mailers I suggest are a mix of postcards or direct mail letters. I like a quarterly sales report or card that goes out four times a year. The January one will be a year in review; the April, July and October ones will be reports for the quarterly sales activity.  These cards should be clean and easy to understand with a section for homes currently for sale, under contract or that sold during the time this card is reporting on. It should include the address, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage of the home, list/sales price, and date sold if closed. These cards should also include a summary of the activity levels and any market details that encourage potential sellers to call you for additional details. Every mailer we send should have a strong call to action for additional details or a free, no-obligation home valuation analysis of their home. The additional eight months of monthly mailers will be a mix of different marketing pieces. The following are examples of the types of mailers you can choose from, or you can supplement with some of your own ideas. I recommend a review/recommendation piece twice a year. These should share a quote from your client about how you helped them sell their home and the service they received. The effectiveness of these pieces is increased if you can include a picture of your clients and even more effective if the home you sold for them is in the neighborhood you are farming. Other mail alternatives for the additional months should be a mix of local service provider cards, community calendars, just listed cards, just sold cards and even an “About Me” card so the owners get to know you. Mail is the foundation, but additional touch points are what turn good farms into great farms. The $2 per month per house I mentioned during the budgeting portion will not be completely absorbed each month via mail costs. These additional funds will be spent on quarterly activities or large events every six months to increase your recognition in the neighborhood. The first of these additional activities should be an evergreen video about the community. This video should include the history of the community, the number of homes, the size range of homes, amenities and a call to action to reach out to you for additional details. Not only is this a great lead attracter, but it also shows your commitment to and expertise on the neighborhood to the owners in the farm area. Other options for special events can include a food truck night you sponsor, a family photography or pet photography day in the neighborhood or even a fall festival in the community park. The key is to serve the neighbors and show your commitment as the neighborhood agent of choice. In addition to the special events, your presence in the neighborhood is also a key to success. Glennda Baker, out of Atlanta, Georgia, said she began her career farming a luxury neighborhood while living in an apartment. Not only did she know the neighborhood inside and out, but she would drive over to the neighborhood she was farming in the afternoons to walk around it, pushing her baby in a stroller so that she could be visible and meet the owners.  Why not walk your dog or take an afternoon walk in your targeted area? Your presence will make a difference. If you follow these steps, you will generate listings. Once you get that first listing, leverage it to audition for your next listing. Spend extra on professional photography and videography of the home that you can share with the neighbors. Send just-listed and just-sold cards, but with a twist. Instead of typical postcards, tell the story of listing the home and the marketing you did, and provide bullet points showing numbers and results.  Door-knock or call neighbors to let them know you are hosting an open house. Put up clean, professional signs with take-one boxes and QR codes for easy access to the marketing videos you produced of the home. Always look for ways to stand out. Mary Maloney, out of San Diego, California, utilizes the take-one box in a unique way once a listing she has goes into escrow. She asks the sellers for a review of their experience and has professional photos taken of the family providing her with the review. Once the home is in escrow, she creates a two-sided flyer that states the home is in escrow with the owner’s photo and review. The second side of the flyer provides other properties they have listed and a strong call to action to call Maloney if they are considering buying or selling. By marketing the listings you take at the highest level possible, you will be rewarded with additional listings. With the changes coming, now is the time to build a consistent listing lead flow for your business. Nothing accomplishes that goal better than geographical farming.

Par Mathilde Damgé et Manon Romain     Temps de Lecture 5 min.  Bercy est suspendu à une suite de lettres. Les agences de notation Moody’s et Fitch doivent dire vendredi 26 avril si elles abaissent ou pas la note financière de la France. Lors des précédentes échéances, elles avaient choisi de maintenir leur notation, mais le ministère de l’économie avait été échaudé par la précédente décision de Fitch, qui avait dégradé la note tricolore en juin 2023. Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s et Fitch : ces trois noms reviennent régulièrement dans l’actualité économique, assortis d’une évaluation, du bon élève (AAA) au cancre (D). Mais que recouvrent exactement ces notations ? Faut-il payer pour être noté, et combien ? Qui sont ces évaluateurs de l’économie mondiale ? Quels problèmes peuvent poser leur fonctionnement et leur modèle économique ? C’est une entreprise dont l’objet est d’évaluer la santé financière d’une autre entreprise ou d’une entité publique – Etat, ville, département ou région. L’agence de notation étudie surtout la capacité à rembourser les dettes, critère qui intéresse le plus les investisseurs. Les analystes écrivent différents scénarios et calculent la probabilité que chacun d’entre eux se réalise, en se fondant sur les entrées et les sorties financières de l’entité qui est notée. Ils utilisent parfois des données fournies par l’entreprise examinée ou celles d’instituts comme Eurostat ou l’Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques (Insee). L’agence prend aussi en compte des paramètres plus globaux comme, pour la France, « les pressions sociales et politiques illustrées par les manifestations contre la réforme des retraites » pour reprendre les termes de la note d’avril de Fitch. In fine, l’agence convient d’un score présenté sous forme de lettres, de AAA (bonne solvabilité) à D (faillite). Moody’s s’arrête à C, avec un système de notation légèrement différent des deux autres. Trois entreprises de notation, toutes américaines, se partagent l’essentiel du marché au niveau mondial : Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s et Fitch. En 2022, les « Big Three », comme elles sont surnommées, détenaient 93 % des parts du marché de l’Union européenne. Et, malgré la recommandation de l’Autorité européenne des marchés financiers de favoriser l’une des dix-sept autres agences accréditées minoritaires, ces trois mastodontes continuent de régner sur les notations. Les entités publiques françaises ayant commandé des notations financières depuis 2017 n’ont d’ailleurs pas suivi cette recommandation et ont toutes recouru à l’un des trois géants. L’un des « Big Three », Fitch, a eu jusqu’en 2018 des capitaux français. Alors détenu par Fimalac, propriété du milliardaire Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, il a finalement été cédé au groupe de médias américain Hearst Corporation. Ses deux concurrents appartiennent à deux groupes spécialisés dans l’information économique, S&P Global et le conglomérat Moody’s Corporation, possédé en partie par le milliardaire Warren Buffett. Ces deux entreprises étant cotées en Bourse, elles ont l’obligation de détailler leurs résultats financiers : depuis dix ans, elles ont plus que doublé leur chiffre d’affaires en dépit d’un nombre plus faible de notations réalisées. Quand une agence attribue une note en baisse à une entité, on dit qu’elle dégrade la notation. Par ricochet, elle dégrade aussi ses conditions d’emprunt ; comme il existe peu de repères objectifs sur les marchés financiers, cette note, même si elle n’est qu’indicative, va les influencer très fortement – elle est même obligatoire dans la gestion de grands comptes. Un spécialiste de BNP Paribas confiait lors d’une enquête au Sénat, en 2012 : « Tous les clients professionnels, du fonds de pension nordique à la banque centrale asiatique, qui ont des années de réserves devant eux, ont fixé leurs règles de gestion en fonction du rating [notation] : pas de limite pour le triple A, limite pour le double A, pas plus de 5 % pour le A, interdiction ensuite. » Chaque évolution de note est guettée par les différents acteurs, car cela détermine si – et combien – un Etat, une collectivité ou une entreprise peut emprunter auprès des investisseurs, et à quel taux. Par exemple, en 2009, quand les agences de notation ont brutalement dégradé les notes des crédits hypothécaires à risque (subprimes), leur valeur a fondu sur les marchés et plusieurs fonds d’investissement ont mis la clé sous la porte. La crise des dettes européennes, lors de laquelle une grande partie des pays du sud de l’Europe a été reléguée dans des catégories à haut risque, illustre parfaitement ce phénomène, comme le détaillait en 2012 le gouverneur de la Banque de France, Christian Noyer : « Il est très clairement apparu en Europe au cours de l’année 2011 que les prophéties concernant la soutenabilité de la dette pouvaient être autoréalisatrices. Elles poussent à la hausse les primes de risque et les taux d’intérêt, ce qui nécessite de dégager des excédents primaires plus importants et complique l’atteinte de l’équilibre budgétaire. » Depuis les années 1970, les agences de notation ont changé de modèle économique ; elles étaient auparavant payées par les utilisateurs finaux de leurs notes, en particulier les banques, qui cherchaient à savoir où placer leur argent en lieu sûr. Désormais, elles sont rémunérées par l’entité, publique ou privée, qu’elles évaluent : leur client est leur objet d’étude. Seules certaines notations sont gratuites, celles des pays les plus riches, car elles concernent des acteurs indispensables pour établir une référence. On parle alors de notations « non sollicitées », explique l’Agence France Trésor, qui gère la dette française, notée gratuitement. En parallèle de ces notations souveraines, d’autres entités publiques peuvent demander à être notées afin de lever ensuite des capitaux sur le marché de la dette : régions, départements, villes, hôpitaux… Selon son dernier contrat, la Ville de Paris a ainsi budgété près d’un million d’euros sur quatre ans pour sa notation et « le suivi de [sa] qualité de crédit ». Le 9 mai, conséquence de la dégradation de la note française, elle a vu avec onze autres collectivités territoriales sa note abaissée à AA−. Les entreprises, elles, sont toujours plus nombreuses à solliciter une notation (+ 20 % en dix ans). Les agences sont très frileuses quand il s’agit de donner leurs tarifs, mais selon plusieurs sources, une agence touche plusieurs dizaines de milliers d’euros pour noter une PME, et jusqu’à un million d’euros pour une banque importante ou une grande maison d’assurance. En revanche, le segment prospère au début des années 2000 des produits de spéculation sophistiqués comme les subprimes s’est très nettement tassé à la suite de la crise financière de 2009 provoquée par l’explosion de la bulle immobilière américaine. Le nouveau modèle économique fait peser sur les agences le soupçon du conflit d’intérêts. En effet, les agences peuvent être tentées d’adoucir une note pour s’assurer que l’entreprise notée, leur client, sera satisfaite. Dans un courriel, obtenu par une commission d’enquête sénatoriale américaine en marge de la crise de 2009, une dirigeante de Standard & Poor’s évoquait la possibilité de changer les critères de notation pour ne pas perdre certains clients, qui pourraient se tourner vers la concurrence s’ils étaient mécontents de leur note. Aujourd’hui, les agences assurent qu’il existe une étanchéité totale entre leur département commercial et celui des analyses. L’Europe ne s’est penchée sur la question du contrôle de ces acteurs controversés de la finance qu’après la crise de 2009. L’Autorité européenne des marchés financiers, auprès de laquelle les agences doivent être accréditées, peut désormais diligenter des enquêtes si des infractions potentielles sont identifiées. Dans le pire des cas, les agences peuvent même perdre leur accréditation. En 2019, Fitch a été sanctionné d’une amende de plus de 5 millions d’euros pour ne pas avoir respecté la législation sur la prévention des conflits d’intérêts, en notant le groupe Casino, dont M. Ladreit de Lacharrière était administrateur à une époque où il possédait encore l’agence à travers sa holding. En 2021, c’est Moody’s qui reçoit une amende totale de 3,7 millions d’euros (partagée entre ses cinq branches européennes) pour avoir noté plusieurs entités où son actionnaire Berkshire Hathaway avait des parts.

As the latter part of 2022 unfolded, artificial intelligence stocks emerged as a beacon of hope for the market amid rapid and substantial interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, coupled with an inflationary spike triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Now, with the first quarter of 2024 past us, major stock indexes have surged to unprecedented heights, setting new records. Earlier this March, all three major stock indexes witnessed surges, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average seeing a substantial increase of 401.37 points, closing at a notable 39,512.13. Likewise, the S&P 500 surpassed the significant threshold of 5,200 for the first time, recording a rise of 0.89%, while the Nasdaq Composite experienced a notable surge of 1.25%, concluding at an impressive 16,369.41. A Federal Reserve survey released on April 17 revealed a slight expansion in U.S. economic activity from late February through early April. The survey's findings were disclosed a day after Fed Chair Jerome Powell shifted from previous guidance regarding potential cuts to the benchmark interest rate. Powell emphasized the necessity of maintaining restrictive monetary policy for a prolonged period due to consistently robust inflation readings surpassing expectations. Until recently, Fed policymakers had been encouraged by data indicating a decline in inflation, which had previously surged to a 40-year peak. Despite vigorous economic growth and a low unemployment rate, inflation had been trending towards the Fed's 2% target rate. However, this trend has stalled and reversed, casting doubt on the Fed's ability to enact rate cuts as initially planned. Investors now anticipate the first rate cut to occur in September, with diminishing prospects for a subsequent cut, with the Fed maintaining its policy rate within the current 5.25%-5.50% range following its April 30-May 1 policy meeting, consistent with its stance since July last year. Of course, many investors and firms still believe this to be nothing more than a minor setback. BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) in its recent Weekly Commentary report stated that it anticipates a shift in earnings growth beyond the tech sector, particularly towards industrials and materials. Despite concerns about Middle East tensions affecting crude oil prices and inflation, the firm asserts that the overall performance of the U.S. economy remains robust, citing indicators such as GDP growth, employment numbers, and consumer spending. See Also: 13 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In addition, on a global scale, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its growth forecasts upward by 0.3% from October levels. The IMF now expects global growth to reach 3.2% in 2024 and 2025, similar to the levels experienced in 2023. It foresees \"stronger activity\" from the U.S., China, and other major emerging markets, while weaker activity is predicted in the Euro area. Additionally, the IMF forecasts median inflation to decrease to 2.8% by the end of 2024 and 2.4% in 2025, compared to 4% at the end of 2023. The historical outperformance of low risk stocks challenges a fundamental principle of finance theory, which suggests that higher risk is typically associated with higher returns. Surprisingly, academic research has consistently shown that low-volatility stocks have outperformed the market over much of the past century. Unlike conventional wisdom, studies indicate that less volatile stocks tend to deliver superior returns over the long term, partly by minimizing losses during market downturns. With lower exposure to market fluctuations, these stocks may not experience the same highs during bull markets, but they also endure fewer losses during market crashes. Consequently, these \"Steady Eddies\" tend to accumulate more of their gains over the entirety of a market cycle. The report further states that: “Since 1973, the least volatile quintile of global stocks delivered returns that were one-third higher than the market, 20% less volatility. This performance generated a more than 50% higher Sharpe ratio—or absolute return relative to risk.” Another avenue to capitalize on low risk investments involves investing in low volatility ETFs, which function as strategic investment instruments with long-term asset allocation strategies, enabling investors to effectively mitigate risk. Historically, minimum volatility indexes have demonstrated reduced volatility compared to broader market indices. In January of this year, Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar, recommended that young investors focus on constructing diversified portfolios using low cost mutual funds and ETFs instead of individual stocks to minimize risks: “If there’s a single investment type where there is a lot of data to support that, where you’ll have a good outcome, it’s using broad market index funds.” With global geopolitical conditions contributing to market volatility, investors would do well to seek refuge in proven safe stocks to protect their investments. In that regard, some of the best low risk stocks to invest include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), among others listed below. Our Methodology To identify the best long term low risk stocks, we sought stocks with a beta value below 1.0, robust fundamentals, favorable analyst ratings, and positive analyst price targets as of April 17. Further refining our criteria, we excluded stocks with market caps less than $10 billion, and those with unstable dividend payouts. The remaining stocks underwent evaluation using Insider Monkey’s database of elite hedge funds from the fourth quarter of 2023. Our list comprises the top 10 stocks ranked by hedge fund sentiment, arranged in ascending order of hedge fund shareholders. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57 Beta Value: 0.77 Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates a global network of membership warehouses, known primarily under the \"Costco Wholesale\" brand. These warehouses offer high-quality, brand-name products at significantly lower prices compared to traditional wholesale or retail outlets. In its quarterly report ending February 18, 2024, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) announced a non-GAAP EPS of $3.71, surpassing market expectations by $0.07. However, the reported revenue of $58.44 billion fell short of Wall Street estimates by $690 million. Insider Monkey's fourth-quarter database revealed bullish sentiments from 57 hedge funds towards Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), a decrease from 65 funds in the previous quarter. Fisher Asset Management, led by Ken Fisher, holds the largest position in the company, with 2.8 million shares valued at $1.8 billion. Madison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter: “Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported solid holiday results and announced a special dividend of $15 per share. Earnings were better than expected driven by better gross margin. Same store sales were 3.9% with solid traffic. Costco also noted better discretionary trends and solid seasonal sales.” Much like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) ranks as one of the best long term stocks to invest in. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62 Beta Value: 0.59 The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is widely acknowledged as one of the premier low-risk investments, renowned for its production of the iconic beverage, Coca-Cola. Apart from its flagship product, the company actively engages in the manufacturing, distribution, and promotion of a diverse array of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and notably, alcoholic beverages within the beverage industry. On March 7, investment advisory firm Argus reaffirmed a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and adjusted the price target to $70 from $67. As of December 2023, Insider Monkey's tracking identified 62 hedge funds with stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), an increase from 58 in the prior quarter. The total value of these stakes amounted to nearly $27 billion. Hayden Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its third 2023 investor letter: “It’s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a “scarcity premium” given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago. Both of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 – 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut. I find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, heathier beverage brands. But these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.” Perhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 – 6% over that time frame.” Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64 Beta Value: 0.54 Based in Purchase, Harrison, New York, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is a prominent American multinational corporation operating in the food, snack, and beverage sector. Renowned for its financial stability, the beverage giant has consistently increased its dividends for over 51 years. As of April 17, it offers a quarterly dividend of $1.27 per share, resulting in a dividend yield of 2.99%. Insider Monkey's database for Q4 2023 reveals that 64 hedge funds disclosed holding stakes in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), slightly down from 65 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is approximately $4.55 billion. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67 Beta Value: 0.55 CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a prominent player in the healthcare sector, boasting a vast network of retail pharmacies and clinics nationwide. Under various brands such as CVS Pharmacy, CVS Caremark, and Aetna, it offers a comprehensive range of healthcare services. Insider Monkey's database, tracking 933 hedge funds, reveals that as of the fourth quarter of 2023, 67 hedge funds held positions in CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS). Notably, Marshall Wace LLP, led by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace, emerged as a significant investor with a substantial stake in the company valued at $382.67 million. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71 Beta Value: 0.44 The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), established in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble, is a global consumer goods corporation headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. Known for its wide array of branded consumer packaged goods, the company operates across segments including Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric & Home Care, and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Moreover, it has a longstanding history of rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 67 years. As of April 17, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) offers a quarterly dividend of $1.00 per share, yielding 2.56%. Insider Monkey's database of Q4 2023 reveals that 71 hedge funds reported holding stakes in The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), down from 75 in the previous quarter. The combined value of these stakes amounts to approximately $6 billion. Fisher Asset Management emerged as the company's leading stakeholder in Q4 with over 10.5 million shares. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) joins the ranks of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) as one of the best long term low risk stocks.   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Long Term Low Risk Stocks to Buy.   Suggested Articles: Insiders are Piling into These 10 Healthcare Stocks in 2024 10 Underperforming Stocks Insiders are Buying 10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Piling Into Disclosure: None. 5 Best Long Term Low Risk Stocks to Buy was initially published on Insider Monkey.

    "content": "In this article, we'll take a look into Goldman Sachs' top 15 stock picks for 2024. If you prefer to skip the introduction about the investment bank and its recent business developments, you can just dive straight into Goldman Sachs' Top 5 Stock Picks for 2024. Established in 1869 by German immigrant Marcus Goldman, Goldman Sachs has evolved into the world's second-largest investment bank by revenue, amassing $1.65 billion in fees during the first quarter of 2024. From its modest origins in a one-room basement office adjacent to a coal chute, the bank has expanded steadily over the years. In 1906, it made its mark in the initial public offering (IPO) market with the iconic Sears, Roebuck, & Co. Goldman Sachs was among the pioneers in emphasizing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios over book values for company valuation. Banks are intricately linked to the fluctuations in interest rates due to their core function of dealing with money. While consumers may lament higher rates, banks often welcome them as they can widen their profit margins, known as the 'spread,' even amidst reduced borrowing demand during tighter monetary conditions. However, higher interest rates can challenge banks to manage their asset base, including funds invested in securities like bonds. Sharp rate fluctuations necessitate the revaluation of these securities, potentially resulting in losses that could jeopardize the stability of even the most profitable of banks. This was evident in the US banking crisis of 2023, particularly impacting Goldman Sachs, which reported a substantial $470 million loss in its loan portfolio during the first quarter of that year. This loss was part of the bank's efforts to restructure its retail banking division in response to the challenging environment. Despite grappling with such challenges a year ago as it ventured into Main Street endeavors, Goldman Sachs came back strong by refocusing on its core strengths. In the first quarter of this year, it surpassed analyst expectations by nearly $1 billion, garnering close to $4 billion in earnings, largely driven by substantial profits in its trading and corporate advisory divisions. While analysts anticipated a turnaround in deal-making activities, Goldman Sachs exceeded this forecast. Notably, the bank's investment banking fees soared by an impressive 32% in the latest results, reaching $2.08 billion. Additionally, the consumer banking division reported a noteworthy 24% revenue growth, marking a refreshing change after years of costly losses and write-downs. Despite the investment bank's surge in revenues, its net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters were a mere $23 million for the first quarter of 2024, a notable reduction compared to the previous year. Additionally, Goldman Sachs trimmed its workforce by 2% following the sale of home lending firm GreenSky in October. This divestiture aligns with the bank's recent strategic shift away from consumer banking to prioritize its core offerings: Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management. Despite incurring a $506 million loss from the sale in 2023, CEO David Solomon remains optimistic, citing the resurgence of capital markets and promising business prospects in Goldman's core sectors as the catalysts for the bank's turnaround. These results were especially gratifying for the bank, coming shortly after rival JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) experienced its sharpest stock decline in almost four years, acknowledging a more challenging outlook than previously expected. Curious about Goldman Sachs' outlook for the future? Here's a glimpse into what its management said during its first-quarter 2024 earnings call: In debt capital markets, tighter spreads have contributed to a constructive issuance environment and investment grades with volumes hitting a record for the first three months of the year. Additionally, refinancing was a major theme with robust high-yield and institutional loan refinancing volumes. Given a more accommodative issuance backdrop as well as the potential for increased acquisition financing, alongside higher M&A activity, we expect solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year. With our long-standing leadership positions across the global capital markets, we have been at the forefront in helping our clients access the markets and our firm stands to benefit further as transaction volumes rise from the 10-year lows. It’s important to note that alongside the reopening, we are seeing in capital markets, our intermediation businesses continue to be active in supporting our clients’ needs. And we’re growing financing revenues across FICC and Equities, which together were a record this quarter and rose 18% sequentially. All-in, our top-tier intermediation franchise, and more durable financing results are helping raise the floor in global banking and markets. In Asset & Wealth Management, assets under supervision rose to a new record of $2.8 trillion this quarter, which represented our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows. We have a diversified platform across public and private markets and are delivering solid performance across asset classes, and we continue to invest resources in growing this business, particularly across Wealth Management, Alternatives, and Solutions. Amidst a backdrop of cautious optimism brewing at JPMorgan, we've scrutinized its leading stock selections. Noteworthy among them are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Our Methodology To compile our roster of Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2024, we reviewed the bank's submissions to the SEC, pinpointing its 15 most substantial investment holdings. Our evaluation process also incorporates insights from Insider Monkey's repository of 933 hedge funds, as of the final quarter of 2023.

Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. [. . .] While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy.” Goldman Sachs' Q4 2023 Investment Value: $4.8 billion Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 162 Visa Inc.

    "title": "\"We'll Risk Expulsion, Arrest\": Pro-Palestine Protests Continue In US",
    "description": "A cause celebre is ringing out across Harvard Yard, Columbia's South Lawn, Yale's Beinecke Plaza and UC Berkeley's Sproul Plaza: Disclose and divest.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-27T02:21:17Z",
    "content": "Some protesters have threatened Jewish students and expressed support for Hamas. A cause celebre is ringing out across Harvard Yard, Columbia's South Lawn, Yale's Beinecke Plaza and UC Berkeley's Sproul Plaza: Disclose and divest. And university students say they won't stop protesting against Israel until that demand is met. \"We're willing to risk suspension, expulsion and arrest, and I think that that will put pressure,\" said Malak Afaneh, a law student at University of California, Berkeley, and a protest organizer.  She and her fellow pro-Palestinian demonstrators want universities to cut their investments in everything tied to Israel and weapons that fuel the war in Gaza. That means funds run by BlackRock, Google as well as Amazon's cloud service, Lockheed Martin and even Airbnb. It's a long-shot demand - university administrators and lawmakers have for decades rejected the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement against Israel, viewing it as antisemitic because it calls into question the legitimacy of the Jewish state and singles out the policies of one country. It's fiercely opposed by many donors and alumni, and what's more, acting on the BDS concept is discouraged by laws in more than half of US states, including New York and California. That's unlikely to change anytime soon. \"I have consistently opposed all forms of antisemitism, including discrimination against and demonization of the people of Israel through the BDS movement,\" said California Assembly Democratic Caucus Chair Rick Chavez Zbur. \"I would strongly oppose any attempts to change laws protecting against such discrimination.\" Yet it's gaining proponents, especially among students at elite universities since Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked Israel and sparked the conflict in Gaza that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians. They're chanting on college grounds, waving Palestinian flags, wearing keffiyehs and beating drums. Encampments have sprouted on campuses, including at Harvard where about 30 tents currently stand in front of the John Harvard statue, according to the Harvard Crimson. Some protesters, including at Columbia and Berkeley, have threatened Jewish students and expressed support for Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the US. All that has left universities struggling to balance the right to free speech with the need for maintaining order and ensuring the safety of students. But on the question of divestment, they are unmoved. Harvard, which has the largest US endowment at almost $51 billion, made clear this month it \"opposes calls for a policy of boycotting Israel and its academic institutions.\" Brown refused to acknowledge BDS demands while students led an eight-day hunger strike. Yale this week wouldn't even consider a proposal to divest from weapons makers and instead police rounded up protesters outside of the Schwarzman Center, arresting more than 40 students. BDS supporters take inspiration from the drive to isolate South Africa during the apartheid era - including actions taken at the time by Columbia, Michigan State and California universities - and recent pushes for colleges to address fossil fuel holdings. This time at Michigan State, where groups of students are camped in tents in People's Park, there's no appetite for severing ties with Israel. \"Divestment would conflict with stewarding the institution's financial health, would increase investment risks, and limit returns and jeopardize the assurance resources will continue to be available now and for future generations,\" said Sandy Pierce, chair of Michigan State University's board, speaking earlier this month at a Board of Trustees meeting. Columbia in February declined a proposal to withdraw financial support from Israel, months before students set up tents on the Morningside Heights campus and created a standoff with the university that resulted in more than 100 arrests. Ray Guerrero, 27, who's studying for a masters in public health, helped pen the divestment proposal for the Columbia University Apartheid Divest coalition. The group has a litany of demands, including cutting ties to Israeli academic institutions, defunding public safety and reparations for the indigenous people of New York. Guerrero understands the goals are lofty for the immediate term, but stresses the main focus for now is disclosure and divestment around Columbia's $13.6 billion endowment. Layla Saliba, a 24-year-old studying for a masters in social work, is part of CUAD's research team, which she said has been studying the school's financial disclosures, including its tax forms and 13Fs disclosures to the Securities and Exchange Commission. \"We were only able to get about 0.6% of their investments as public information,\" she said. The latest 13F discloses just $47 million of its holdings, with the vast majority stock in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. That leaves billions of dollars undisclosed. \"That's really concerning because our endowment, yes, it's funded by benefactors, it's funded by donors, but a portion of that is also funded with our tuition dollars,\" Saliba said. \"And we feel that as students, we need to have more transparency on that.\" Universities say the protesters' claims aren't accurate.   The University of California, which opposes any boycott of Israel, said in a statement that tuition fees are not used for investments. College endowments are almost always funded with donations and investment gains. What's more, they fund financial aid for students and other operating expenses such as teacher salaries. And the challenge isn't just ideological. Endowments typically don't hold large concentrations of single stocks as they used to decades ago, when activists targeted companies operating in South Africa. Endowments have long relied on external managers, including private equity firms and hedge funds. Almost 700 institutions hold about $840 billion in endowment assets. They also use ETFs, index funds or mutual funds that pool hundreds of stocks and bonds. With private equity, a school's money may be locked up for several years, without an option to withdraw, while hedge fund managers can rapidly move in and out of securities without disclosing their trades to investors. \"These active strategies are not buying stocks to hold on for the long term,\" said Philip Zecher, chief investment officer of Michigan State University's $4 billion fund. \"They're looking to make money off trading. It's not like your grandmother buying AT&T stock and sitting on it for 50 years.\" The fight against fossil fuel investment, a cause championed by students for decades, also shows how hard it can be to implement divestment. Universities largely haven't switched strategies to sell holdings, which are frequently tied up in long-term private equity funds, even as they've committed to policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on campuses. Despite the setbacks and opposition, some pro-Palestine protesters are undeterred. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com \"It seems like a no for now, but students will keep pushing,\" said Lumisa Bista, a junior studying astrophysics at Yale, who was among protesters at the university who slept overnight at Beinecke Plaza this week. \"I'll keep pushing.\"  (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)

Buffett turned Berkshire Hathaway from a struggling textile company into a massive holding company that has made its investors rich over the years.

Check Out: 401(k) Growth Potential: Ways to Double Your Savings in 10 YearsRead Next: One Smart Way To Grow Your Retirement Savings in 2024 Buffett took over Berkshire Hathaway in 1965 with many early acquisitions and investments in insurance companies like National Indemnity and GEICO, using the “float” — premiums paid by customers that haven’t yet been paid out in claims — to fuel additional investments. Today, Berkshire fully owns dozens of businesses, some obscure, some household names, like Duracell, Fruit of the Loom, Benjamin Moore and See’s Candy. Sponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity. So, just how much would you have today if you had invested $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway stock 10 years ago? Berkshire Hathaway has two classes of stock, A stock and B stock. Buffett famously refused to do stock splits, feeling that keeping the price high encouraged long-term investors, even as the price of a share of A stock grew to incredible heights. The company eventually relented — sort of. They issued B stock which carries a much lower price and has lower voting rights than A stock. A single share of A stock traded for around $190,000 ten years ago, putting it well out of reach of our $1,000 budget, so you would have had to invest in the B shares. In April of 2014 those shares traded between $121.09 and $129.20 — for simplicity’s sake, let’s split the difference and call it an average cost of $125 a share. That works out to exactly 8 shares. B shares closed today, the 24th of April, at $405.95 a share, meaning your 8 shares would be worth $3,247.60 – that’s about a 225% total return, or about 12.5% annualized. That sounds pretty good, and it is. Berkshire beat the market over a ten year period.

    "content": "Plus: Alphabet And Microsoft Show AI Can Indeed Get Bigger, Inflation Remains Sticky, New TikTok Law Heralds Legal Challenges And Many Questions, LVMH Partners On AI Some analysts have been talking about the “AI bubble” in the stock market, wondering when it might pop. The argument for it is solid: Companies that are working with different areas of AI—integrating AI technology into the functions they already have, investing in up and coming players in AI, and building infrastructure to make AI applications possible—are tip-toeing into a nascent area in technology that has a lot of potential, but hasn’t yet proven its worth. AI development so far has been expensive, and the platforms that have resulted have yet to show significant cost and time savings. Last week’s earnings reports and market reactions to them demonstrate that if AI is indeed a bubble, it can still get bigger. Following a blockbuster earnings report Thursday afternoon that smashed analysts’ expectations, Google parent Alphabet’s stock price surged nearly 10%, boosting it to its first valuation exceeding $2 trillion. Microsoft, which also reported earnings Thursday afternoon, beat analysts' expectations with overall revenue increasing 17% year over year. Both companies’ success pushed the overall stock market higher and gave a significant boost to the share prices of tech companies in the chip business, including Nvidia, AMD and Arm Holdings. While Alphabet and Microsoft both have a wide variety of business areas, AI was the engine that drove the results and the rallies. In the beginning of the earnings call, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai describes the company as being in an AI-first mindset since 2016. He touted the company’s accomplishments using AI—the technology now is present in Google’s search, messaging and advertising efforts, as well as its Chrome browser. Their cloud infrastructure is prepared to support AI applications, already working with several large companies. And its Gemini chatbot is utilized by both individual people and enterprises. For Microsoft, its AI-heavy intelligent cloud division saw a 21% increase in revenue in the last quarter. AI on its own isn’t enough to boost markets, however. Meta also reported earnings last week, coming off of the launch of its AI chatbot and highly capable LLM, Llama 3. While Meta beat expectations and posted a 27% year-over-year increase in sales, Wall Street didn’t treat the Facebook parent company as well. The company indicated that sales would likely be slowing down in the next quarter, and more money would need to be invested in AI before monetizing it. Last week, Meta’s stock was down more than 10%. Until AI can become a bigger portion of Meta’s business, it may not matter much to investors what the company does with it. After all, 97.8% of Meta’s revenues come from advertising on its various social platforms, compared with Alphabet, which got 86.6% of its revenues from ads. While tech companies are providing the backbone and infrastructure to implement AI, companies are starting to utilize the technology. I talked to Partnership on AI CEO Rebecca Finlay about where businesses are in the AI revolution, and what they should do to implement it. A portion of our conversation is later in this newsletter. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Even more proof that AI is strong enough to move markets: All three major indexes closed up on Friday following some fairly pessimistic reports on the economy as a whole. On Thursday, the Department of Commerce found only 1.6% GDP growth in the first three months of 2024 when compared with the final quarter of 2023. Consensus estimates predicted much higher GDP growth of 2.5%, and the lower figure sent markets downward for the day. The GDP growth was at its slowest pace since 2022, but Forbes senior reporter Derek Saul notes that any growth is laudable, considering a year ago policymakers and economists thought it would stay flat as interest rates were increased to slow the rate of inflation. On Friday, the core personal expenditures index, which is the Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge, showed 2.8% inflation in March. While this number remains unchanged from February’s 2.8%, it’s a bit higher than economist forecasts of 2.7%. It’s also much higher than the 2% target set by the Federal Reserve in order to cut interest rates. As actual numbers from the beginning of 2024 have continued to show the persistence of inflation, the chances of rate cuts happening have steadily gone down. Now, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of interest rate reductions in the first half of the year is just 13%. ILLUSTRATION BY FERNANDO CAPETO FOR FORBES; PHOTO BY ROBERTO WESTBROOK/TETRA IMAGES RF/GETTY IMAGES After years of talking about banning TikTok, the federal government actually did it last week. A measure requiring either the sale of Chinese company ByteDance’s short video app to a U.S.-friendly owner, or eventually banning it from app stores, was added to a package of bills providing military aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. It passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Joe Biden. And now the legal battle begins. Forbes’ Alexandra S. Levine and Emily Baker-White report TikTok is not going down without a fight. In an internal memo from Michael Beckerman, TikTok’s top policy leader in the Americas, a court battle is promised. “This legislation is a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the 170 million Americans on TikTok,” he wrote. A top First Amendment law firm is already assembling creators and small businesses that rely on TikTok to bring the new law to court, Levine reports. Nearly 5 million businesses use the short video app to reach customers. Many said the sale of TikTok isn’t a realistic goal, either. Forbes reporting has shown many of TikTok’s internal systems are built on ByteDance tools custom-made years ago by Chinese engineers, which will be difficult to take apart. Former National Security Agency general counsel Glenn Gerstell told Forbes TikTok’s sophisticated algorithm makes a divestiture more “economically unrealistic,” since China is likely unwilling to sell it. ByteDance has already denied reports that it was exploring a sale without the algorithm. The new Louis Vuitton luxury shop in Paris. Luxury brands rely on human creativity and craftsmanship to design and make items that provide experiences for which people will pay top dollar. So luxury powerhouse LVMH’s partnership with Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence seems to be somewhat built on an inherent contradiction. Forbes senior contributor Pamela N. Danziger writes LVMH is interested in exploring AI applications in its business—including making sales predictions, augmenting customer experience, supply chain management, marketing, manufacturing, and yes, product design. LVMH Chief Data Officer Anca Marola said in a statement that the company has already used AI to augment efficiency. “It’s important to embrace and take advantage of these ground-breaking technologies, but do it in the right way that is virtuous for our future as companies, people and society.” Partnership On AI CEO Rebecca Finlay. The Partnership on AI is a nonprofit organization dedicated to ensuring AI developments advance positive outcomes. CEO Rebecca Finlay has a unique perspective on how businesses are bringing AI into their operations, what they plan to do with it and what’s likely to happen next. I talked to her about business AI implementation and how to get the benefits from this high tech platform. This conversation has been edited for continuity, brevity and clarity. A longer version is available here. What do you see as an ideal way a business can assess the way to go about using AI? Finlay: For me, an ideal assessment is one that doesn’t prefer innovation and speed over responsibility. I say that the reason why we can drive fast is because we have brakes in our cars. The reason why we can drive fast and be safe is because we have seatbelts, right? Those are two innovations that are safety innovations, that actually drive our capacity to move more quickly and more effectively and more safely down the road. And so I encourage companies to get started because there are all sorts of ways in which AI could be helping them to serve their customers better. I also say if you’re going to get started, make sure that you are considering the responsibility requirements right from the very start. Then you’re building, I think, a much more effective system that’s going to drive much more effective product down the road as well. When CEOs are looking at AI right now, do they seem to have a handle on kind of everything it takes? Are they aware of the responsibility, safety and security issues, whether they need to hire more people, if more training is needed for existing employees? It’s a question of, do you have the right people with the right skill sets? It used to be, and it continues to be, very important that you have very strong IT expertise, computer science and computer engineering expertise in house. But what we’re seeing with some of these generative AI models is their capacity to code, and their capacity to be able to pick up some of that coding work that some of your software engineers may have been doing previously, and that might create space for them to do some of the innovations that we’re talking about around AI. But also, I think it is understanding from your privacy professionals and your legal advisors internally, as well as your product and marketing professionals. What are they each hearing in their own professional associations? We’re seeing a lot of interest from lawyers’ associations to better understand what the legal issues are. And one of the key pieces there, of course, for both your lawyers and your privacy officials and others, is the evolving policy landscape. We now have the EU AI Act, so if you’re a company that is in the EU market, understanding what the implications are for you therein is really crucially important. And then we have a number of states in the U.S. who are developing different state-level privacy bills. So really, you need to have a community that’s both attending to what’s happening in-house, but also really understanding from their professional perspective what some of the emerging trends and opportunities might be. When CEOs are looking at AI and talking to their finance team, where is the priority? Are they looking for a quick return on investment? Is it eventually saving money? Or is it all about keeping up with other companies? CEOs are dealing with these demands across their business sectors, no matter whether it’s AI or otherwise. There’s always this tension between speed, pace of change, need to innovate for efficiency and productivity; together with what is my competition doing, and how do I make sure that I’m in a competitive place to move forward. And then the other piece of it is the risk; the unknown pieces of this model. I think that CEOs are in this moment, weighing all of those. Getting the good team in place internally to give them some advice, trying to engage as much as they can with experts outside of their companies who can help to give them some of that advice as well. And I think, most importantly with the board, is coming to a clear understanding about what level of transparency the board needs in order to be assured that the AI decisions that are taking place are being done transparently and responsibly. One of the interesting developments that I’ve noticed, some [publicly traded] companies have started within those [annual financial] filings that specifically speaks to what are the risks: We’re using AI. What are the risks that we want to make sure that the public is aware of? That, to me, is a really interesting form of governance that really shows how important it is for companies to be attending to the innovation components of AI, and doing it in as transparent a way as possible.

    "published_at": "2024-04-28T11:00:00Z",
    "content": "The promise of artificial intelligence (AI) was bolstered by Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) ... [+] earnings. The pace of earnings picked up steam last week, with 159 S&P 500 companies reporting, and will be followed by the busiest week with 175 scheduled to report. After the relative drag from bank and healthcare earnings over the previous weeks, the more diversified company mix boosted earnings expectations for the quarter. A more detailed preview of the earnings season is available here. S&P 500 Earnings Season The S&P 500 rose 2.7% for the week, rebounding to 7.4% year-to-date. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.62% from 4.66%, causing a 0.1% decline in the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond index. After a tough previous week, the Magnificent 7 soared by almost 6%. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft\nMicrosoft\n (MSFT), Meta Platforms\nMeta Platforms\n (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple\nApple\n (AAPL), NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\n\nSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust\n (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla\nTesla\n (TSLA). Notable companies with earnings this week include McDonald’s (MCD), Starbucks\nStarbucks\n (SBUX), Coca-Cola\nCoca-Cola\n (KO), Amazon.com (AMZN), Eli Lilly (LLY), Apple (AAPL), and Berkshire Hathaway\nBerkshire Hathaway\n (BRK/A, BRK/B). Market Returns At almost the halfway point in the reporting season, blended earnings, which combine actual with estimates of companies yet to report, have rebounded to match forecasts at the end of the quarter. The most significant driver of the improvement in earnings came from the communication services sector, primarily due to earnings beats by Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL). According to FactSet, the industrial, technology, and consumer discretionary sectors also boosted first-quarter earnings estimates. Earlier in the season, the healthcare sector was punished by the accounting treatment of in-process research and development from acquisitions by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Gilead Sciences\nGilead Sciences\n (GILD). According to FactSet, better-than-expected earnings from Merck (MRK) and Gilead Sciences boosted the expected earnings growth rate for the healthcare sector to -28.1% from -30.5%. 1Q 2024 Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, combining after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. With nominal GDP growth likely solid year-over-year for the first quarter, topline revenue growth for companies should have a tailwind. Sales growth improved last week and moved higher than expectations going into the earnings season. 1Q 2024 Sales Growth By Sector So far, the blended earnings performance has underperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter equals the expectations of +3.5% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Though first-quarter GDP growth of 1.6% last week was below the consensus estimates of 2.5%, the details were more vital than the headline. Domestic demand looks robust, excluding the more volatile components of inventories and net exports, which subtracted from first-quarter GDP growth. Real final sales to private domestic purchasers, which measures private demand in the domestic economy, remained healthy at 3.1 percent in the first quarter after increasing by 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter. U.S. Economic Growth Measures While the GDP report should not lead to any concerns about economic growth, the inflation component was more concerning. The pace of inflation measured by the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure, core PCE, accelerated to 3.7% quarter-over-quarter annualized. GDP: Inflation The inflation surprise and continued economic growth sent the odds of a June Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut to less than 15%. The probability of a July start to rate cuts is now one in three. The chance of a cut by the September meeting dipped below 75%. The total rate cuts expected in 2024 fell to one. Based on those expectations, the 2-year Treasury yield is 5% after being as low as 4.1% in January. Probability Of Fed Rate Cut The bumpy last mile of the Fed’s fight against elevated inflation remains an obstacle for stocks as yields rise and the certainty around an economic soft landing is challenged. On the positive side of the ledger, the resilient economic growth illustrated by last week’s GDP report leaves the profit rebound story intact. In addition, the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) was bolstered by Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) earnings. Even though Meta Platforms (META) fell as investors were disappointed by the expected future spending on AI capital expenditures, it reinforced the expectation of further spending on artificial intelligence technology. The busiest week of earnings contains some bellwethers like Apple and Amazon.com that will be closely watched. The Fed meets with no change in short-term interest rates virtually assured, but Chair Powell’s comments will be scrutinized for clues on Fed rate cut timing in the wake of the hot inflation data. With the focus on inflation and the Fed in data-dependent mode, the monthly payrolls report on Friday will be notable. In addition, Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting occurs on Saturday with highly anticipated comments from Warren Buffett. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Alphabet (GOOGL), McDonald’s (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Coca-Cola (KO), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) within its recommended investment strategies.

His legacy lives on through millions of investors who continue to swear by his investment philosophy. \n     \n      Vishal Khandelwal, founder of ‘Safal Niveshak’—a popular blog on investing that is now into its fourteenth year—is one such investor. Khandelwal says Munger's words struck a chord with him and he has since made it his life motto—to try and be useful, through his own writing and everything else that he does. “While I have been following both Buffett and Munger for several years, Munger’s teachings hold a very special place in my life,\" he says. \n     \n      In an interaction with Mint for the Guru Portfolio series, Khandelwal shares how he has applied Buffett and Munger’s investing lessons to his personal investment portfolio. In this series, leaders in the financial services industry share how they are handling their finances and investments. \nAsset MixKhandelwal says Indian equities comprise 90% of his asset allocation. The remaining is invested in other financial products, including liquid funds, public provident funds and gold jewellery. While a bulk of his equity investments—60% of the equity portfolio—are held in direct stock holdings, 20% is held in equity mutual fund (Parag Parikh Flexicap Fund). The remaining 20% is in two portfolio management services (PMSes).\n\nAlso read: Shouldn’t have put initial savings in real estate: Sandeep TandonKhandelwal, whose portfolio delivered a 35% return in the past year, says he tries to make sure that there are not more than 15-16 stocks in his portfolio at any given point in time. When it comes to investing in stocks, he likes to look for high-quality businesses available at reasonable valuations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView Full Image\n\n\nVishal Khandelwal's investment portfolio \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n     \n      Khandelwal adds that once he buys a high-quality business, he likes to stick with it for the long-term. “I have become much more empathizing of the business managers now and that has made me a long-term owner of the businesses. I have shifted to being a ‘buy-and-never sell’ investor now. Never sell doesn’t mean buy and forget; it means buy and keep reviewing. But don’t do anything till the business managers are not doing anything wrong, till the business is doing fine,\" he says.\n\nLearnings from MungerKhandelwal says Buffett was in the initial years a lot more quantitative in his analysis. “It was Munger’s influence that pulled him more in the direction of quality. I also had the same focus on numbers when I started my career as an analyst. Reading more of Munger’s writings helped me appreciate the importance of a high-quality business and finding the right balance between valuations and quality,\" he says.\n\n     \n      He adds that value and growth investing should not be looked as contrasting styles, but as parameters that need to co-exist in identifying a good investment. \"There is a lot of confusion between value investing and growth investing, if people were to use that differentiation. But I have learnt from Munger and Buffett and also practised in my own stock analysis—you only find value where there is growth. If the business is not going to grow in the future, if the business doesn't have a long runway of growth, then cheap price does not mean that you should go and buy it,\" Khandewal explains.\n\nAlso read: Will SM Reits be safe for India’s retail investors?“I am conscious of the valuations at which I am willing to buy the stock, but also highly conscious of the quality of the business. I may still pay what might appear to be expensive but that is only for very high-quality businesses,\" he adds.\n\nLife lessons“From Munger’s writings, I have not only learnt about investing but about life as well. I have learnt about the idea of not doing what can kill me, the idea of communicating my ideas in the simplest manner, the idea of also focusing on what really makes you happy,\" he says.\n\n     \n      “Both Buffett and Munger have led long lives, well into their 90s despite certain negative traits such as eating junk food; simply because they have led their lives on their own terms. Buffett says they used to tap dance to work. I have also sort of tap danced to work for the last 13 years, which has helped me immensely,\" he says.\n\nAlso read: Let a hundred flowers bloom: Nikhil Kamath’s approach to life and investing“Munger had to deal with a lot more tragedies in his life. Early in his life, he had to go through a messy divorce, which wiped away almost all his savings. He lost his son to leukaemia. A botched surgery also led to blindness in one of his eyes. In spite of all this, he has never given into self-pity. Had Munger delved into self-pity, he would not have risen to such heights,\" Khandelwal points out.\n\nBeyond stocksTaking a leaf out of Munger's book, Khandelwal says that he, too, does not look at stocks as a full-time activity. “As he grew older, Munger spent much of his time on things unrelated to investing or stock-picking. That’s something which I also want to do gradually. Stock-picking is still going to be a part of what I am because it is something that I have done for the last 20 years. But I have a very limited universe. I have never tried to increase my circle of competence. I don’t go to complex industries, complex businesses or complex investment strategies,\" he says.\n\n     \n      “I am going to keep 10-15 stocks. I have one mutual fund and I can go up to a maximum of three. I have term insurance and health insurance. That’s the entire personal finance I have, and I have maintained that for a few years now,\" he says.\n\n     \n      He says people should avoid becoming full-time investors. \"This is not a full-time activity. The less time you give to it, the better off you are because then you are not taking action all the time and you are not focusing on stock price fluctuations and companies all the time. I don't see myself as a full-time investor. I see myself as more of an educator, blogger and an illustrator and then an investor. Investing is what I do when I have money from all other things I do,\" Khandelwal says.\n\nCareer checkKhandelwal began his career as a stock market analyst in 2003. In, 2008 when the stock market crashed, he saw many of his distant family members and friends losing a lot of their money as they were wrongly advised by brokers and advisers.\n\n     \n      He felt that his calling was to teach people how not to lose their money when investing. But he did not start in 2008 as he still had a home loan. In 2011, he completely repaid his home loan with the help of his stock portfolio, quit his then job and started Safal Niveshak.\n\nAlso read: Why Devina Mehra is bullish on silverToday, he has enough dividends coming from his stock holdings that can take care of 75% of his household expenses. “All household expenses may be taken care of by dividends in the next 4-5 years.

Thankfully, my writing, my blog and teaching has helped run the house,\" he says.\n\nInsuranceKhandelwal has  ₹1.5 crore of term life cover, which is spread across three policies of  ₹50 lakh each, with different maturities. This arrangement, he says, gives him more flexibility as he can gradually bring down his coverage over the years.\n\n     \n      Apart from this, he has health cover of  ₹30 lakh for himself and a  ₹20 lakh family floater cover.\n\nAll in the familyKhandelwal says he doesn’t talk to his two children (a 19-year-old daughter and a 13-year-old son) a lot about finance. “As a family, we have focused on certain simple and bigger principles in the past 18-19 years. We have ensured that we practice what we are teaching our kids. For example, in the idea of compounding, delaying some gratification is important. So, we keep talking about that. I don’t see my children becoming a part of the finance industry. My daughter is more focused on her creative side and inclined towards dance and design. My son seems more interested in technology. I also don’t see myself as part of the finance industry. I see myself more of a teacher and educator.

    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s PacifiCorp now faces a demand for $30 billion from victims of Oregon’s 2020 Labor Day wildfires, an escalation of a legal onslaught on the largest grid operator in the western US. Most Read from Bloomberg Tesla Axes Most of Supercharger Team in Blow to Other Automakers Traders Expect Biggest Fed-Day Move in S&P Since 2023, Citi Says Wall Street Hit by Fed Jitters to Close Wild April: Markets Wrap Pot Stocks Surge on Report DEA Set to Reclassify Marijuana HSBC CEO Quinn Unexpectedly Steps Down After Almost 5 Years While the amount sought in an amended complaint filed Monday is about two and a half times what the utility is worth, it’s also much bigger than the payout PacifiCorp might be expected to face based on claims resolved so far. Read More: Wildfires Are Upending Some of the Safest Bets on Wall Street The growing liabilities for PacifiCorp prompted Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett to warn in his annual letter to investors that wildfires have turned utilities across the western US into risky investments. Utilities in California, Colorado, Hawaii and Texas have also faced billions in fire liabilities. A jury already found PacifiCorp liable in 2023 for its role in the fires, but victims must undergo separate trials to determine individual damages. The new filing in state court in Portland formally adds the names of 1,000 residents who are covered by a class action case over the destruction of about 2,500 properties in western Oregon. Jurors so far have awarded 36 plaintiffs a total of about $220 million — an average of $6 million per person. That’s far less than the $30 million per person that victim lawyers are seeking in Monday’s filing, which asks for up to $5 million to compensate for actual losses and as much as $25 million for psychological trauma. Read More: PacifiCorp Fire Victim Who Leapt in River Awarded $9 Million PacifiCorp, which is appealing last June’s verdict of gross negligence, previously lambasted the amount of damages sought by the plaintiffs as “delusional” in an October court filing. “The $30m demand for each plaintiff clearly demonstrates the need for some manner of reform in the legal process,” the company said Tuesday in a statement. “PacifiCorp’s ability to provide essential services is being threatened by excessive wildfire damages pursued by plaintiff’s attorneys who have a substantial financial stake in these outcomes.” Lawyers for plaintiffs declined to comment on Monday’s filing. Berkshire said in a recent regulatory filing that it faces fire claims in Oregon and California of about $8 billion. That includes demands from state and US government agencies totaling more than $1 billion for various firefighting and cleanup costs. Read More: Berkshire Shows Unusual Risk Appetite in Wildfire Court Fight The utility was accused at last year’s trial of failing to heed weather warnings and shut off electricity in its service areas ahead of a wind storm that toppled power lines. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says “We think a settlement in the mid- to high-single-digit billions is the most likely outcome. Both sides have incentive to settle. Going to trial with all class plaintiffs is risky for PacifiCorp as it’s already lost the first three jury trials, with verdict amounts that point to potential damages in the low- to middle-double-digit billions. Plaintiffs have an incentive as well, because PacifiCorp has viable arguments on appeal to eliminate non-economic damages.” — Elliot Stein, Senior Litigation Analyst To read the full report, click here PacifiCorp, which has settled some claims over the 2020 fires, has said it’s confident the 2023 liability verdict will be overturned on appeal. But the litigation has spooked investors, hurting the company’s bonds and its credit rating. The company replaced its chief executive officer last summer and is exploring options with Oregon regulators and lawmakers to minimize its wildfire exposure, including recouping its litigation losses from customers and capping damages for non-economic claims. --With assistance from Mark Chediak.

    "content": "search 0.4-acre property has 101 feet of waterfront  SHARE THIS ARTICLE FONT SIZE Jeweler Paul Morelli sold a waterfront teardown on Miami Beach’s Hibiscus Island for $15.4 million to a billionaire’s son. Records show Morelli sold the house at 394 South Hibiscus Drive to Malik Sefrioui, son of Moroccan real estate billionaire Anas Sefrioui. Jill and Danny Hertzberg of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker Realty had the listing, and David Solomon of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty brought the buyer. Anas Sefrioui heads Groupe Addoha, a homebuilder in Morocco. He has an estimated net worth of $1.1 billion, according to Forbes.  Morelli heads his jewelry line, House of Paul Morelli, which sells pieces in Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. The business evolved from his family’s Philadelphia-based theater costume company before switching to jewelry in the 1970s, according to Morelli’s website.  He is also a frequent investor in Miami Beach real estate. He sold a waterfront North Bay Road mansion as a teardown for $22.9 million in June.   Morelli bought the Hibiscus Island house for $11.5 million in 2021. Built in 1930, the 6,200-square-foot house has six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, one half-bathroom and a pool. Morelli marketed the 0.4-acre property as a development opportunity with 101 feet of waterfront, the listing shows. He listed it for $18 million in August, according to Redfin. Hibiscus Island is among Miami Beach’s residential island neighborhoods coveted by luxury buyers.  Basketball star Victor Oladipo sold his non-waterfront house on the island for $9 million in September. In 2022, spec developer Pascal Nicolai sold a waterfront spec mansion for $16 million. That same year, real estate investor Laurent Groll and his partners flipped a lot for $14 million, one month after buying it for $11 million.   All rights reserved © 2024 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc."

More Info Japanese authorities may intervene again in the currency market this year as U.S. interest rates are expected to remain high.The Japanese Yen strengthened sharply overnight after crashing to its lowest level since April 1990, breaking 160/USD. The FT reports that traders in Hong Kong, Australia and London said it was “highly likely” that the recovery was due to Japan’s finance ministry selling dollar reserves and purchasing the Japanese currency for the first time since late 2022.\n\n\n  While analysts suggested the size and speed of the jump smacked of intervention, some traders questioned that conclusion and said Japanese banks sold dollars for customers as it rallied. Japan’s top currency official, Masato Kanda, chose to keep investors guessing by declining to comment. \"It is difficult to ignore the bad effects that these violent and abnormal movements [in currencies] will cause for the nation's economy,\" Kanda told reporters on Monday. Dow Jones reported authorities stepped in to support the yen, citing people familiar with the matter. It is unlikely to be the last time Japan intervenes in the currency market this year, given that U.S. interest rates are likely to remain high, said Alvin Tan, head of Asia foreign-exchange strategy at RBC Capital Markets. \"We will have a tug of war going forward between Tokyo and the market,\" he said. *  *  * The yen crashed in early Asia trading, tumbling to match is exact lows from April 1990 in what is being blamed on a 'fat finger' trade or multiple barrier-option trades being triggered, by sources that have literally no idea. The plunge extended Friday's big drop which followed BoJ Governor Ueda's apparent lack of interest in doing anything about the yen's decline, claiming it had 'no impact' on the currency's inflation picture. “Currency rates is not a target of monetary policy to directly control,” he said. “But currency volatility could be an important factor in impacting the economy and prices. If the impact on underlying inflation becomes too big to ignore, it may be a reason to adjust monetary policy.” In fact, policymakers have repeatedly warned that depreciation won’t be tolerated if it goes too far too fast. Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki reiterated after the BoJ meeting that the government will respond appropriately to foreign exchange moves. Potential triggers for interventions are public holidays in Japan on Monday and Friday next week, which bring the risk of volatility amid thin trading. “Should the yen fall further from here, like after the BOJ decision in September 2022, the possibility of intervention will increase,” said Hirofumi Suzuki, chief currency strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. “It is not the level but it’s the speed that will trigger the action.” Well currency volatility is what he has now... \n\n\n Source: Bloomberg The sudden drop pushed USDJPY perfectly to its April 1990 highs to the tick...  Source: Bloomberg The currency pain was all focused in the Japanese market as EUR and GBP strengthened against the USD...  Source: Bloomberg Perhaps even more notably, the yen puked relative to the Chinese yuan, hitting 22 for the first time since 1992 and putting further pressure on Beijing to potentially do something...  Source: Bloomberg The question is, of course, what will Japan's MoF/BoJ do now - if anything as their recent excuses about 'velocity' or some such spin are now out of the window after a 6-handle standalone surge in their currency in a few short days (when the rest of the world's currencies are not). “Authorities may say they don’t target levels per se, but they do pay close attention to the trend and the rate of change and current levels suggest they have to act soon or risk facing a credibility crisis,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group Ltd. “The FX market is almost taking them on like the bond vigilantes of old.” Specifically as SocGen's FX strategist Kit Juckes noted on Friday, the yen's decline is becoming disorderly, which points to a final, potentially sharp, decline before it finds a floor. However, as we detailed last week, the problem with intervention is that once the genie is out of the bottle… it’s hard to put it back in. In other words, the onus should be on the BOJ to step in with a much more hawkish move than the market expects.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT As Viraj Patel from Vanda Research goes on to note that \"we’re at a stage where MoF/BoJ have no choice but to intervene. The best way would be for BoJ to hike 25bps this week. It’s not about the macro anymore (BoJ should’ve normalized policy faster last year).\" Instead, what is going on is that Japan's disastrous handling of its currency has evolved into a game between speculators and officials: Specs are short yen for good fundamental reasons (carry). At this stage, a “surprise” hike to send a signal to markets that they are concerned about ongoing FX weakness (and don’t test us) would be less costly to the economy vs. a further devaluation in the yen. It also adds an additional level of uncertainty to the BoJ/MoF reaction function - which speculators (long carry trades) don’t like. Meanwhile, FX intervention - which unfortunately looks to be the MoF/BoJ’s preferred route based on recent history - is not even a short-term fix anymore. USD/JPY dips would be quickly bought into based on recent market chatter. A hike goes a bit further towards solving the root cause of yen weakness - even it’s only a marginally better option.  However, not everyone is convinced intervention is imminent. In a note late last week, Deutsche Bank says the currency's decline is warranted and finally marks the day where the market realizes that Japan is following a policy of benign neglect for the yen. We have long argued that FX intervention is not credible and the toning down of verbal jawboning from the finance minister overnight is on balance a positive from a credibility perspective. The possibility of intervention can't be ruled out if the market turns disorderly, but it is also notable that Governor Ueda played down the importance of the yen in his press conference today as well as signalling no urgency to hike rates. We would frame the ongoing yen collapse around the following points. The bottom line, Deutscxhe concludes, is that for the JPY to turn stronger the Japanese need to unwind their carry trade. But for this to make sense the Bank of Japan needs to engineer an expedited hiking cycle similar to the post-COVID experiences of other central banks. Time will tell if the BoJ is moving too slow and generating a policy mistake. A shift in BoJ inflation forecasts to well above 2% over their forecast horizon would be the clearest signal of a shift in reaction function. But this isn’t happening now. The Japanese are enjoying the ride. Finally, it goes without saying that the only true circuit-breaker for yen weakness is lower US yields/weak US macro, which is unlikely until the election if, as so many now speculate, there has been a directive by the Biden admin to make the economy look as good as possible ahead of the elections, even if that means manipulating the data to a grotesque degree. One added complexity for MoF/BoJ is that their two options for tackling yen weakness indirectly adds upward pressure to global rates/yields. They’re caught between a rock and a hard place… and speculators know (enjoy) this. And finally there is China: the longer BOJ/MoF does nothing to curb the collapse of the yen, a move which is seen a pumping up the country's exporting base at the expense of other mercantilist nations such as China, the higher the probability Beijing will retaliate against Tokyo by devaluing its own currency. At which point all hell will break loose. But, one way or another, as Goldman noted, it's crunch time for USDJPY.

Berkshire’s portfolio contains two ETFs: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE ticker symbol: SPY) and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). Though they makeup a very small percentage of Berkshire’s investment basket, Buffett recognizes these important diversifications. “In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,” Buffett said at Berkshire’s 2020 annual meeting.

While it’s not the cheapest — there’s an annual management fee of $9.45 for every $10,000 invested — it’s very competitive and the most well-established ETF on the market.  Berkshire owns a little more of the Vanguard ETF than SPDR and mentioned in a 2013 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders that if you’re choosing between the two, “I suggest Vanguard’s,” according to the Motley Fool. While both ETFs own many of the same funds, VOO has an expense ration cheaper than SPDR, charging 0.03% compared to 0.095%. As CNBC Make It reported, this doesn’t seem like a big deal, but it can save and make you more over the long haul and that’s something that’s right up Buffett’s alley.

    "content": "Mantiene el precio objetivo en 195 dólares por acción  Bolsamania Tiempo de lectura: 3min Las acciones de Apple han subido un 2,48% en Wall Street este lunes después de que los analistas de Bernstein decidieran elevar su recomendación sobre los títulos de la compañía a 'sobreponderar'. El precio objetivo se ha mantenido sin cambios en 195 dólares por acción, lo que le otorga un potencial de revalorización del 11,5% desde sus niveles actuales de cotización. Según los expertos de Bernstein, la firma de la manzana ha pagado en exceso en bolsa los temores fundados por la caída de las ventas del iPhone en China y su exposición al gigante asiático, por lo que recomiendan \"ser como Buffett\", en alusión al reconocido inversor Warren Buffett, y comprar las acciones baratas. \"A pesar de su reputación como inversor de compra y retención a largo plazo, Warren Buffett ha sido notablemente disciplinado a la hora de aumentar su posición en Apple cuando es relativamente barata y recortarla cuando es relativamente cara\", destaca el analista Toni Sacconaghi en una nota recogida por 'CNBC'. De esta manera, el analista anima a los inversores a \"hacer lo mismo, añadiendo posiciones en Apple cuando el múltiplo sea de 25 veces las ganancias o menos, y recortándolas a 30 veces o más\". Cabe recordar que el conglomerado Berkshire Hathaway, que dirige Warren Buffett, es el mayor accionista de Apple, y ha mostrado su confianza en las posibilidades de la compañía en repetidas ocasiones. Apple acumula caídas en bolsa cercanas al 9% en lo que va de año, a medida que crecían las preocupaciones sobre la salud del mercado asiático. La semana pasada, un informe de investigación publicado por Counterpoint Research aseguraba que las ventas del iPhone han caído un 19,1% en el primer trimestre de 2024 en China. Las cifras muestran que la compañía afronta su peor desempeño desde 2020, cuando se vio fuertemente presionada por la pandemia de Covid-19, mientras que ahora cede posiciones ante el empuje de los dispositivos de Huawei, HONOR y Xiaomi.

The Dow, meanwhile, finished the week up a more modest 0.7%. The gains last week came as several Big Tech names jumped after strong earnings and traders examined fresh U.S. inflation data. Looking ahead, this week will be filled with more major corporate earnings, key labor data and a Federal Reserve meeting. Follow live market updates. The earnings reports keep coming and they don't stop coming. So far, it's looking like it will be a strong quarter. More than 45% of S&P 500-listed firms have posted results so far and about four out of every five of those have surpassed expectations, according to FactSet. This week will be a busy one: Roughly 160 S&P 500 companies are set to post their results, including tech giants Apple and Amazon and McDonald's. Here are the earnings to watch this week: Paramount Global's board is ready to remove CEO Bob Bakish from his role as early as Monday morning, people familiar with the matter told CNBC's Alex Sherman. They also said he won't be on the call when Paramount reports its earnings Monday afternoon. Bakish has lost the confidence of Paramount Global's controlling shareholder Shari Redstone, according to people familiar with her thinking, and she wanted to remove him before the company has negotiations with cable company Charter Communications. Those talks will be key to putting a valuation on Paramount as it negotiates a possible merger with Skydance Media. Advertising is so back. Meta, Snap and Google all reported first-quarter earnings results this week that beat analysts' expectations, and all three saw improvements in their ad businesses. That comes after a rough 2022, when companies cut down on their marketing spending as inflation grew, and a 2023 that was marked by layoffs and cost cuts. Investors and analysts had been cautious before the earnings, but Citi analysts wrote in a Friday note that the broader advertising environment is \"clearly strengthening,\" citing success at Google Search and YouTube. Tesla hit a key milestone to rolling out its whole self-driving package in China as the country removed restrictions on its cars, saying they passed data security requirements. Tesla's cars are already available in China, but the move raises expectations that its driver-assistance software, Full Self Driving, will be available in the market soon. So far, China has limited the use of that technology. The breakthrough came as Tesla CEO Elon Musk arrived in Beijing over the weekend for an unexpected meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang. Tesla shares were up 9% in premarket trading Monday. — CNBC's Alex Harring, Fred Imbert, Alex Sherman, Ashley Capoot, Ryan Browne and Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report. — Follow broader market action like a pro on CNBC Pro.

(GIL; TSX and NYSE) today announced that it has filed its management proxy circular with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities on SEDAR+ in connection with its upcoming 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “2024 Annual Meeting”) to be held on May 28, 2024. The full circular will be available at the Company’s issuer profile at www.sedarplus.ca, the EDGAR website at www.sec.gov, and on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at https://gildancorp.com/en/investors/. The Gildan Board strongly recommends that shareholders vote on the BLUE proxy card “FOR” ALL of Gildan’s qualified and experienced director nominees. The Board also recommends that shareholders vote for the elections of Karen Stuckey and J.P. Towner, who have been nominated by a shareholder, Browning West, as they would be additive to the Board as Gildan pursues its growth agenda. The Company’s recommended slate of Director candidates for the 2024 Annual Meeting include the following individuals: In addition, the Company today announced the launch of its 2024 Annual Meeting website: www.futureofgildan.com. For additional resources and information about the 2024 Annual Meeting, or the Company’s strategy, governance, and voting instructions, please visit this site. The Gildan Board also issued a letter to shareholders today, which is included in the management proxy circular. The full text of the letter follows: Dear Fellow Shareholder, We want to inform you that we announced important changes to our Board of Directors (“the Board”) and have filed our management proxy circular for our 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “2024 Annual Meeting”) to be held at 10:00 am EDT on May 28, 2024, at 1250 René-Lévesque Blvd West, Suite 3610 in Montréal, Québec, Canada. Ahead of this filing, on April 22, 2024, the Gildan Board of Directors disclosed its slate of director nominees for the 2024 Annual Meeting, including five new independent directors, Timothy (Tim) Hodgson, Lewis L. (Lee) Bird III, Jane Craighead, Lynn Loewen, and Les Viner who have been appointed to the Board, effective May 1, 2024. Directors Donald C. Berg, Maryse Bertrand, Shirley Cunningham, Charles Herington and Craig Leavitt will depart the Board, effective the same day. Luc Jobin and Chris Shackelton have informed the Board that they will not stand for re-election at this year’s meeting. They will continue to serve in their capacity as members of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors supervising the previously communicated sale process until the close of the 2024 Annual Meeting in order to help transition this process to the refreshed Board. To facilitate a smooth transition process at this important juncture, the new directors have been recent observers to the Board. In addition, the newly constituted Board is expected to unanimously appoint Tim Hodgson as Independent/Non-Executive Chair, effective May 1, 2024, taking the seat of Donald Berg. Donald has decided to step down from the Chair role to ensure a smooth transition while the incoming Chair leads Board discussions in support of the Company’s next phase of growth under its new President and CEO, Vince Tyra. We are excited to welcome Tim, Lee, Jane, Lynn and Les to our Board – all of whom possess the necessary leadership experience, relevant expertise, and diverse backgrounds to be of tremendous value to our Board and management team in driving Gildan forward. We also want to sincerely thank Donald, Maryse, Shirley, Charles, Luc, Craig, and Chris for their leadership, service, and many contributions throughout their tenure. They have been instrumental in helping lead and support a company whose foundation is now primed for sustainable, profitable growth and value creation. We wish them the very best in their future endeavors. These Board changes were recommended by our Corporate Governance and Social Responsibility Committee (the “Governance Committee”) after extensive conversations with Gildan’s shareholders. One of the consistent themes we heard during those conversations was the need for more apparel expertise and experience with value-oriented consumer products on the Board. That is why we are also recommending that you vote for two of the nominees on the dissident slate, Karen Stuckey and J.P. Towner. While Browning West continually rebuffed our request to interview their candidates, it was clear to the Board, both through prior consideration of potential candidates and feedback received from shareholders and other stakeholders of the Company, that Karen Stuckey and J.P. Towner would be additive to our Board as Gildan pursues its growth agenda. Since the Board refreshment announcement on April 22, members of the incoming Gildan Board have had the opportunity to speak with Ms. Stuckey and Mr. Towner and the Board members are looking forward to working with them.

The Company’s nominees have been thoughtfully selected to serve on the Board following a robust recruitment process, including the hiring of an independent search firm, and extensive shareholder engagement. The Board, as reconstituted, possesses strong business and core industry experience and deep expertise in key functional areas, such as corporate governance, legal, ESG, and HR, which are needed to oversee Gildan in its next phase of growth. Gildan is focused on delivering shareholder value by successfully executing a revamped Gildan Sustainable Growth strategy with a new, highly qualified CEO There is now genuine excitement around Gildan. We have a new, highly engaged CEO with a credible strategic plan and a newly constituted Board of Directors that bring the right combination of expertise, experience, and collaboration to position the Company to create meaningful value for shareholders. Vince Tyra is exactly the right CEO to scale Gildan in an increasingly complex and fiercely competitive environment. In his first few months, Vince has hit the ground running, being the first Gildan CEO in years to visit most manufacturing sites in order to get immersed into our processes and culture. He has been attending trade shows to reconnect with customers, holding town halls to create openness and start a two-way dialogue with employees, and engaging with shareholders and major partners to better understand the challenges and opportunities facing the Company. Importantly, following extensive proactive engagement of our shareholders by Vince and the management team, Vince has outlined five key focus strategic priorities, which reflect shareholders’ desire to continue sustainably growing Gildan. You can view Vince Tyra’s investor update or watch a webcast of his presentation at www.futureofgildan.com. These initial priorities, which build on our current Gildan Sustainable Growth strategy, are: 1. Successfully execute supply chain initiatives to maintain availability, cost leadership and industry leading margins. 2. Leverage Gildan’s unique brands and develop distinct commercial capabilities to accelerate growth and strengthen the Company’s market position. 3. Deepen Gildan’s relationships with existing and prospective retail partners, strengthening the Company’s position as supplier of choice. 4. Complement Gildan’s strong North American market position with renewed focus on select international markets to drive growth. 5. Empower and build world-class talent and leadership to ensure the long-term resilience of Gildan’s business. It should not come as a surprise that investors are already starting to see results from their new CEO. Gildan knew what they were getting when they hired Mr. Tyra as the result of a process that involved 3 highly qualified finalists and 32 reference checks as part of an extensive look at his background. At just 34 years of age, Vince was handpicked to take on the role of President of Fruit of the Loom and was instrumental in the implementation of a plan to stabilize the company and restructure the business, paving the way for its eventual sale to Berkshire Hathaway. He then became the chief executive at Broder Bros after Bain Capital noticed the turnaround work at Fruit of the Loom. At Broder Bros, he successfully engineered the acquisition of Alpha shirt holdings. During his six-year tenure at Broder Bros., he grew EBITDA by 223% delivering a compound annual growth rate of 26.4% to shareholders. Yoo Joon Kim was a Principal at Bain Capital when Mr. Tyra was CEO of then Bain-owned Broder Bros and had this to say about working with Vince: “With almost 30 years of private equity investing experience, I have worked with countless CEOs in multiple industries. Vince was in the top tier of those executives given his leadership strengths, ability to build strong teams and culture, financial performance, acquisition experience … Gildan is very fortunate to have Vince as its next leader. I have tremendous confidence in the Company’s future under his stewardship.” After Border Bros., his next stop was Southfield Capital as an Operating Partner and member of the investment committee. At Southfield, his portfolio produced an internal rate of return of 27% and a multiple on invested capital of 3.2x. And most recently he served as Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Mergers and Acquisitions at Houchens Industries, where he oversaw and developed corporate strategy for the $4 billion revenue employee-owned holding company. Every stop in his journey tells the same type of story. Vince is the type of leader who is present and builds winning teams focused on the relentless pursuit of value creation. Given his track record, shareholders are right to see Vince as a value creator. While the early returns on Vince’s tenure have been encouraging, there is still much work to be done.   Our management team, led by Vince, will continue to review the business and looks forward to presenting a comprehensive vision for the future at an upcoming Investor Day to be held in the Fall of 2024. We are now at a pivotal moment in the trajectory of Gildan, one where shareholders have a choice between reverting to a past devoid of a credible growth path, where the share price has long been range bound, or embracing a bright future with an inspired and fully dedicated CEO, strong strategic direction and leadership style, and a newly refreshed Board committed to collaboration and value creation. Our strategy will allow us to drive sustainable and profitable growth, while enhancing returns for our shareholders. As is our fiduciary duty – and to ensure that we are maximizing shareholder value – your Board has also been reviewing other strategic alternatives through dialogue with potential bidders after receiving a confidential non-binding expression of interest to acquire Gildan. Despite Browning West’s public stance against considering any alternative, its attempts to disrupt the process, and their portraying the review of alternatives as an entrenchment strategy for the Board, the ongoing process is robust and will be measured against the value creation potential of our compelling current strategic plan. We are confident that the newly reconstituted Board that we are recommending will pursue their fiduciary duties by continuing to review such alternatives and assessing them against the Company’s future plans. It will ultimately be up to the shareholders to decide whether to accept any offer. There was a case for change at Gildan in 2023, and the Board delivered the necessary change by appointing Vince Tyra as Gildan’s President and CEO. By moving to replace Mr. Chamandy with Mr. Tyra as Gildan’s President and CEO and overseeing the evolution of Gildan’s Sustainable Growth Strategy, Gildan made the necessary change to ensure that the Company is well positioned for the future. LET US BE CLEAR: the decision to transition leadership away from the founder CEO was not taken lightly. While we acknowledge the contributions made by Glenn Chamandy during his 20-year tenure as CEO, it became evident to the Board that a change was necessary to allow Gildan to reach its full potential. The Board was unanimous in its conviction that retaining Mr. Chamandy as CEO would have jeopardized the future of Gildan and destroyed significant shareholder value. After agreeing to a formal succession plan in 2021, Mr. Chamandy recently made clear that he never intended to abide by that agreement despite being part of the discussions since 2021, telling the media in a December 2023 about face, “I had no intention of leaving. You know, my view is that I would leave when I think the time is right for the company.”   As Mr. Chamandy was putting his personal interests ahead of the Company’s, the business was losing momentum and growth was stagnating. Amidst this stagnating performance, and despite the previously agreed to succession plan, Mr. Chamandy demanded that the Board approve a risky, multi-billion-dollar acquisitions strategy predicated on him staying CEO for several more years, and threatened that he would quit and sell all his shares if the Board did not do so. The independent Board did not believe that Mr. Chamandy’s strategy was in the best interests of the Company or its shareholders. In light of Mr. Chamandy’s threat to resign, the Board believed that it had no choice but to proactively remove him so that the Board could continue with its process of finding a qualified successor that was aligned with the current needs of the Company and interests of shareholders as soon as possible. Browning West responded to Mr. Chamandy’s departure almost immediately, which the Board believes reflects clear preparation or alignment with Mr. Chamandy. Browning West’s comments spread a false narrative on both the CEO succession process and the Company’s new CEO. Shareholders would be right to question whether Mr. Chamandy and Browning West had a well-orchestrated plan in place, designed to create as much noise and chaos as possible around his departure to undermine the Board and Company. The aim was simple: create a false narrative to provide pretext for launching a proxy contest to take control of the Board and the Company, without paying any premium, and reinstating Mr. Chamandy as CEO with a more compliant Board. During the past 5 months, Gildan’s Board has engaged with and welcomed the views of the Company’s shareholders including Browning West and its supporters. Through almost 90 meetings, it was evident that there was not unanimous support for Browning West and its nominees – even among those who Browning West publicly identifies as supportive. Specifically, there was concern about Mr. Chamandy returning to the Company, that the nominees were selected by Browning West without input from other shareholders, and about providing Browning West with unchecked control of the Company. It became clear that the type of board that shareholders wanted to see moving forward was a board that would support value creation through balanced fresh perspectives with historic knowledge; previous board experience with a focus on governance, industry, and manufacturing experience; and one that was responsive to the views of shareholders. Shareholders also told us they wanted a focused Board that would work collaboratively. With this significant input from shareholders, the Governance Committee, which included members who were not targeted by Browning West, has proposed the aforementioned new independent nominees as part of this year’s board slate in order to maintain the Company’s commitment to ongoing refreshment. The slate strikes a balance between ensuring the Board retains historical continuity during a period of transition and provides fresh perspectives to ensure it continues to serve its important oversight function on behalf of all shareholders. It is critical for shareholders to understand that the Board made Browning West aware of its willingness to engage in a balanced refreshment process that considered not only their views, but those of other shareholders as well. Unfortunately Browning West made it clear that the only changes it was willing to accept were changes that benefited Browning West exclusively, prolonging this unnecessary proxy fight. Despite Browning West’s intransigence, the Governance Committee attempted to meet with certain of Browning West’s nominees to discuss their possible addition to the Board prior to the shareholder meeting. While some nominees expressed an openness to this, Browning West precluded its nominees from participating in any such meetings. Nonetheless, the Governance Committee examined the qualifications and competencies of the Browning West slate in order to ensure that the nominees being put forward to shareholders at this year’s Annual Meeting were responsive to the desire for shareholder nominated representation and comprised the strongest possible Board that could be constructed. After that evaluation, and based on prior deliberations and feedback received from external sources, the Board concluded that Karen Stuckey and J.P. Towner would bring skills that were additive and thus recommended that they be endorsed as nominees. That same process concluded that other nominees from Browning West’s slate would only result in duplication of skillsets on the Board or disruption to the forward momentum underway at Gildan. Browning West continues to run a costly, disruptive campaign built on false assumptions and misleading statements. Browning West’s involvement in Gildan should concern every shareholder. Holding just a small position in the stock, the activist is attempting to take control of both the Board and the Company, all without paying any premium. Browning West appears to have violated U.S. law in building its position in Gildan to call a Special Meeting, and then withdrew its request for that meeting when the Board notified Browning West and U.S. regulators about the violation. Equally troubling, Browning West has amplified false and salacious stories from tabloid media to score points in the proxy contest. Browning West will use any tactics no matter how disgraceful, to gain control of Gildan. Shareholders who care about governance are right to ask what this behaviour will amount to if Browning West gains Board control? Looking at Browning West’s past activist record, it has delivered wildly volatile results for its own investors and left a trail of chaos at the companies that fell victim to its campaigns. It is a record that should flash warnings signs when considering the following: Over the last several months, the Board has attempted to reach a settlement agreement with Browning West and offered multiple times to interview its candidates so that the Board could consider those candidates for nomination at the 2024 Annual Meeting. Good faith efforts by the Company were repeatedly rebuffed by the activist hedge fund. Regardless, we felt it critical to ensure that the Board’s composition reflected the conversations we had with shareholders and that is why we have recommended that shareholders vote for Karen Stuckey and J.P. Towner. We do not believe that the rest of Browning West’s slate offers an increase in expertise or experience to Gildan’s business, and accordingly, they do not represent the best mix of director candidates. In fact, we believe that a vote for Peter Lee or Glenn Chamandy would be a vote to undo the work the Governance Committee has done to put forward a refreshed, collaborative Board that is superior to the Browning West slate and reflects the desires of shareholders. If this proxy contest is about governance and the future of the Company as Browning West asserts, then shareholders should support the Company’s nominees. Handing unfettered control of the Company to Browning West and granting it the Board and the CEO it picked with no checks or balances – as shareholders have expressed concern about – is not in the best interests of the Company. In conclusion: CEO Vince Tyra and a refreshed Board with a credible strategy will ensure Gildan reaches its full potential. Gildan has the right CEO, a strong plan and a newly refreshed, strong, engaged, and diverse Board, with a balanced mix of experience, skills, leadership expertise, and fresh, new perspectives to enhance value for shareholders. The Board is fully aligned behind Vince in his role as CEO and looks forward to helping him continue to execute and enhance the Company’s strategy. We encourage shareholders to support Vince in executing our long-term vision as well as our highly skilled, proven, and recently refreshed Board. VOTE THE BLUE PROXY CARD TODAY We look forward to seeing you at the 2024 Annual Meeting and for the opportunity to answer your questions, but if you cannot attend, it is important that your shares be represented. Whether or not you plan to attend the 2024 Annual Meeting, we urge you to read the Management Information Circular carefully and to vote FOR ALL the Gildan nominees by using the enclosed BLUE proxy and NOT to vote for Browning West’s director nominees other than Karen Stuckey and J.P. Towner or return any proxy card sent to you by Browning West. As Gildan is using a “universal” proxy containing all the Gildan nominees as well as the other nominees proposed by Browning West, there is no need to use any other proxy regardless of how you propose to vote. Thank you for your continued support of Gildan and please vote the BLUE proxy card today.

La liste de candidats aux postes d’administrateurs recommandés par la Société en vue de l’assemblée annuelle de 2024 comprend les personnes suivantes : En outre, la Société a annoncé aujourd’hui le lancement de son site Web portant sur l’assemblée annuelle de 2024 : www.futureofgildan.com/fr/. Pour plus de ressources et de renseignements sur l’assemblée annuelle de 2024 ou encore sur la stratégie et les pratiques en matière de gouvernance de la Société et les instructions de vote, nous vous invitons à visiter ce site. Le conseil de Gildan a également publié une lettre à l’intention des actionnaires aujourd’hui, laquelle est incluse dans la circulaire de sollicitation de procurations. Le texte intégral de cette lettre est reproduit ci-après : Chères actionnaires,Chers actionnaires, Nous désirons vous informer que nous avons annoncé d’importants changements touchant notre conseil d’administration (le conseil) et que nous avons déposé notre circulaire de sollicitation de procurations de la direction en vue de notre assemblée annuelle des actionnaires de 2024 (l’assemblée annuelle de 2024) qui se tiendra à 10 h HAE le 28 mai 2024 au 1250, boulevard René-Lévesque Ouest, bureau 3610, à Montréal (Québec) Canada. Préalablement à ce dépôt, le 22 avril 2024, le conseil d’administration de Gildan a fait connaître sa liste de candidats aux postes d’administrateurs en vue de l’assemblée annuelle de 2024, y compris cinq nouveaux administrateurs indépendants, à savoir Timothy (Tim) Hodgson, Lewis L. (Lee) Bird III, Jane Craighead, Lynn Loewen et Les Viner, qui ont été nommés au conseil avec prise d’effet le 1er mai 2024. Les administrateurs Donald C. Berg, Maryse Bertrand, Shirley Cunningham, Charles Herington et Craig Leavitt quitteront le conseil avec prise d’effet à la même date. Luc Jobin et Chris Shackelton ont informé le conseil qu’ils ne représenteraient pas leur candidature à l’élection à l’assemblée de cette année. Ils continueront d’agir à titre de membres du comité spécial du conseil d’administration qui supervise le processus de vente, annoncé antérieurement, jusqu’à la clôture de l’assemblée annuelle de 2024 afin de faciliter la transmission de ce dossier au conseil renouvelé. Pour faciliter une transition harmonieuse à cette étape importante, les nouveaux administrateurs ont récemment agi à titre d’observateurs du conseil. De plus, le conseil nouvellement constitué devrait nommer à l’unanimité Tim Hodgson à titre de président du conseil indépendant/non membre de la direction, avec prise d’effet le 1er mai 2024, lequel occupera le siège de Donald Berg. M. Berg a décidé de quitter son poste de président du conseil afin d’assurer une transition harmonieuse tandis que le président du conseil entrant mène les discussions au conseil en appui à la prochaine étape de croissance de la Société sous la gouverne de son nouveau président et chef de la direction, Vince Tyra. Nous nous réjouissons à l’idée d’accueillir M. Hodgson, M. Bird, Mme Craighead, Mme Loewen et M. Viner au sein de notre conseil, lesquels possèdent tous l’expérience voulue à titre de membres de la direction et les compétences pertinentes, et présentent des parcours diversifiés qui représenteront des atouts précieux pour notre conseil et notre équipe de direction en vue de faire progresser Gildan. Nous tenons également à remercier sincèrement M. Berg, Mme Bertrand, Mme Cunningham, M. Herington, M. Jobin, M. Leavitt et M. Shackelton de leur leadership, de leurs états de service et de leur apport considérable. Ils ont joué un rôle essentiel en contribuant à l’orientation et au soutien d’une entreprise maintenant prête à connaître une croissance durable et rentable et à créer de la valeur. Nous leur souhaitons beaucoup de succès dans leurs projets futurs. Ces changements au sein du conseil ont été recommandés par notre comité de la gouvernance d’entreprise et de la responsabilité sociale (le comité de la gouvernance) après des discussions approfondies avec les actionnaires de Gildan. L’un des thèmes récurrents de ces discussions concernait le besoin d’avoir au sein du conseil davantage de connaissances et d’expérience du secteur des vêtements axées sur des produits de consommation à bas prix; c’est pourquoi nous recommandons également que vous votiez pour deux des candidats de la liste dissidente, Karen Stuckey et J.P. Towner. Bien que Browning West n’ait cessé de refuser que nous interviewions leurs candidats, il est apparu clairement au conseil, après avoir pris en considération les candidats potentiels et les commentaires reçus de la part des actionnaires et d’autres parties prenantes de la Société, que Karen Stuckey et J.P. Towner compléteraient bien le conseil, compte tenu de l’objectif de croissance que s’est donné Gildan. Depuis l’annonce du renouvellement du conseil faite le 22 avril dernier, les membres du conseil de Gildan entrant ont eu la chance de s’entretenir avec Mme Stuckey et M. Towner et se réjouissent à l’idée de travailler avec eux. En guise de mise en contexte et de présentation, Tim Hodgson connaît une longue et remarquable carrière de direction acquise dans les domaines de la gestion d’actifs, des finances ainsi que des services publics. Il est reconnu pour la clarté, l’attention, la collaboration et la création de valeur qu’il a su apporter lorsqu’il a opéré des redressements dans un contexte souvent difficile. M. Hodgson a été conseiller spécial auprès du gouverneur de la Banque du Canada, M. Carney, et a occupé le poste de chef de la direction de Goldman Sachs Canada de 2005 à 2010 après avoir occupé différents postes à responsabilité croissante aux bureaux de New York, de Londres, de la Silicon Valley et de Toronto de cette banque d’investissement internationale.

Jane Craighead compte plus de 20 ans d’expérience auprès de sociétés ouvertes et en matière de gouvernance de conseil d’administration, d’abord en tant que membre de la haute direction puis à titre d’administratrice indépendante. Mme Craighead est dotée de compétences en finances et en comptabilité, en gestion des ressources humaines, y compris la rémunération des membres de la haute direction, en gouvernance, en stratégie d’affaires et en gestion du changement.

Elle détient le titre de Fellow de l’Institut des comptables professionnels agréés (FCPA) ainsi que le titre d’administratrice agréée de l’Institut des administrateurs de sociétés (IAS.A).

M. Viner possède le titre d’administrateur agréé de l’Institut des administrateurs de sociétés (IAS.A). Les candidats de la Société ont été soigneusement choisis en vue de l’exercice des fonctions d’administrateur par suite d’un processus rigoureux, dans le cadre duquel la Société a notamment eu recours à un cabinet de recrutement indépendant, et d’une vaste consultation auprès des actionnaires. Le conseil, sous sa forme renouvelée, possède une solide expérience des affaires et du secteur d’activité principal ainsi qu’une expertise approfondie dans des domaines fonctionnels clés comme la gouvernance, les affaires juridiques, les questions en matière d’ESG et les RH, lesquelles sont nécessaires pour superviser Gildan dans sa prochaine phase de croissance. Gildan se concentre sur la création de valeur pour ses actionnaires en mettant en œuvre avec succès une stratégie de croissance durable renouvelée avec un nouveau chef de la direction des plus compétents Il y a une réelle effervescence entourant Gildan en ce moment. Nous sommes dotés d’un nouveau chef de la direction excessivement motivé ayant un plan stratégique convaincant et d’un conseil d’administration nouvellement constitué apportant la parfaite combinaison de connaissances, d’expérience et de collaboration afin que la Société soit en position de créer une valeur significative pour les actionnaires. Vince Tyra est exactement le chef de la direction qu’il faut pour faire évoluer Gildan dans un environnement de plus en plus concurrentiel et complexe. Au cours des premiers mois de son mandat, M. Tyra s’est vite mis à l’œuvre : il a été le premier chef de la direction de Gildan depuis de nombreuses années à se rendre dans la plupart des usines de fabrication afin de s’imprégner de nos processus et de notre culture. Il a participé à des foires commerciales pour renouer avec les clients, a tenu des séances d’information afin de susciter l’ouverture et d’amorcer un dialogue avec les employés et a interagi avec les actionnaires et des partenaires importants afin de mieux comprendre les défis que la Société doit relever et les occasions qu’elle doit saisir. Surtout, à la suite d’une interaction soutenue et proactive de M. Tyra et de l’équipe de direction auprès de nos actionnaires, M. Tyra a défini cinq principales priorités stratégiques, qui traduisent la volonté des actionnaires de nous voir poursuivre la croissance durable de Gildan. Vous pouvez consulter la mise à jour à l’intention des investisseurs de M. Tyra ou visionner une webdiffusion de sa présentation à l’adresse www.futureofgildan.com/fr/. Ces priorités initiales, qui s’appuient sur notre stratégie de croissance durable actuelle, sont les suivantes : 1. Mettre en œuvre avec succès les initiatives liées à la chaîne d’approvisionnement afin de maintenir la disponibilité des produits, une position dominante sur le plan des coûts et des marges parmi les meilleurs du secteur. 2. Mettre à profit les marques propres à Gildan et développer des capacités commerciales distinctes afin d’accélérer la croissance et de renforcer la position de la Société sur le marché. 3. Approfondir les relations de Gildan avec ses partenaires actuels et potentiels de la vente au détail, consolidant la position de la Société en tant que fournisseur de choix. 4. En complément de la position solide de Gildan sur le marché nord-américain, accorder une attention renouvelée à des marchés internationaux choisis pour stimuler la croissance. 5. Bâtir un bassin de talents et une équipe de direction de classe mondiale et leur donner les moyens nécessaires pour assurer la résilience à long terme des activités de Gildan. Il n’est pas étonnant que les investisseurs constatent déjà les fruits des efforts de leur nouveau chef de la direction. Gildan savait exactement quel genre de personne était M. Tyra lorsqu’elle l’a recruté par suite d’un processus ayant permis de retenir trois candidats finalistes des plus compétents et au cours duquel elle a procédé à 32 vérifications des références et s’est penchée attentivement sur ses antécédents. À 34 ans seulement, M. Tyra a été sélectionné rigoureusement pour assumer le rôle de président de Fruit of the Loom et a joué un rôle déterminant dans la mise en œuvre d’un plan visant à stabiliser et à restructurer l’entreprise, pavant la voie à son éventuelle vente à Berkshire Hathaway. Il est ensuite devenu chef de la direction chez Broder Bros. après avoir été remarqué par Bain Capital en raison de son travail de redressement chez Fruit of the Loom. Chez Broder Bros., il a élaboré avec succès l’acquisition d’Alpha Shirt Holdings. Pendant son mandat de six ans auprès de Broder Bros., il a fait croître le BAIIA de 223 %, ce qui s’est traduit par un taux de croissance annuel composé de 26,4 % pour les actionnaires. Yoo Joon Kim, qui était directeur auprès de Bain Capital lorsque M. Tyra était chef de la direction de Broder Bros., alors détenue par Bain, avait ceci à dire au sujet de son expérience de travail avec M. Tyra : « Ayant près de 30 ans d’expérience dans le domaine de l’investissement privé, j’ai travaillé avec d’innombrables chefs de la direction dans de nombreux secteurs. Vince faisait partie de ceux qui se distinguaient parmi ces dirigeants émérites compte tenu de sa force de leadership, de sa capacité à mettre en place des équipes et une culture solides, de son rendement financier, de son expérience en matière d’acquisition… Gildan a beaucoup de chance d’avoir Vince comme prochain dirigeant. J’ai énormément confiance en l’avenir de l’entreprise sous sa direction. » Après Broder Bros., son chemin l’a mené chez Southfield Capital en tant que partenaire opérationnel et membre du comité d’investissement. Chez Southfield, son portefeuille a généré un taux de rendement interne de 27 % et un multiple du capital investi de 3,2 fois. Dernièrement, il a été vice-président principal de la stratégie d’entreprise et des fusions et acquisitions chez Houchens Industries, où il a supervisé et élaboré la stratégie d’entreprise pour la société de portefeuille détenue par des employés dont les produits d’exploitation s’élèvent à 4 milliards de dollars. Chaque étape de son parcours témoigne du même genre d’histoire. M. Tyra est le type de meneur qui est présent et bâtit des équipes solides axées sur la recherche incessante de création de valeur. En raison de sa feuille de route, les actionnaires ont raison de voir en M. Tyra un créateur de valeur. Les rendements obtenus tôt en début de mandat de M. Tyra sont certes encourageants, mais il reste encore beaucoup de travail à faire. Notre équipe de direction, avec M. Tyra à sa tête, continuera de se pencher sur l’entreprise et présentera une vision exhaustive de l’avenir à l’occasion d’une journée des investisseurs devant être tenue à l’automne 2024. Gildan se trouve maintenant à la croisée des chemins. En effet, les actionnaires peuvent choisir de retourner dans un passé dépourvu d’une vision de croissance convaincante, où le cours de l’action a longtemps été contenu à l’intérieur d’une certaine fourchette, ou de se tourner vers l’avenir qui s’annonce prometteur grâce à un chef de la direction inspiré et entièrement dévoué, à une orientation stratégique claire et à un style de leadership fort ainsi qu’à un conseil d’administration nouvellement renouvelé attaché à la collaboration et à la création de valeur. Notre stratégie nous permettra de susciter une croissance durable et rentable tout en rehaussant les rendements pour nos actionnaires. Comme il est dans notre devoir fiduciaire de le faire – et pour être certains que nous maximisions la valeur pour les actionnaires – votre conseil examine aussi d’autres avenues stratégiques en entretenant un dialogue avec des initiateurs potentiels depuis qu’il a reçu une indication d’intérêt non contraignante confidentielle visant l’acquisition de Gildan. Malgré la prise de position publique de Browning West rejetant toute autre option, ses tentatives de perturber le processus et le fait qu’elle ait qualifié l’examen de ces autres options de stratégie de retranchement de la part du conseil, il s’agit d’un processus continu et rigoureux dans le cadre duquel les différentes options seront évaluées par rapport au potentiel de création de valeur de notre convaincant plan stratégique actuel. Nous sommes persuadés que le conseil renouvelé que nous recommandons à nos actionnaires s’acquittera de ses obligations fiduciaires en continuant d’examiner ces autres options et en les évaluant en fonction des plans futurs de la Société. Tout bien considéré, il reviendra aux actionnaires de décider d’accepter ou non une offre. Un besoin de changement se faisait sentir chez Gildan en 2023 et le conseil a apporté le changement voulu en nommant Vince Tyra à titre de président et chef de la direction de Gildan Gildan a apporté le changement voulu pour que la Société soit bien positionnée pour l’avenir en choisissant de remplacer M. Chamandy par M. Tyra en tant que président et chef de la direction de Gildan et en lui confiant la surveillance de l’évolution de la stratégie de croissance durable de la Société. NE NOUS MÉPRENONS PAS : La décision d’opérer une transition au niveau du leadership et de remplacer le chef de la direction fondateur n’a pas été prise à la légère. Bien que nous reconnaissions l’apport de Glenn Chamandy au cours de son mandat de 20 ans à titre de chef de la direction, le conseil a dû se rendre à l’évidence qu’un changement s’imposait pour que Gildan puisse atteindre son plein potentiel. Le conseil était convaincu à l’unanimité que le maintien en poste de M. Chamandy à titre de chef de la direction aurait compromis l’avenir de Gildan et détruit considérablement la valeur pour les actionnaires. Après avoir accepté un plan de relève en règle en 2021, M. Chamandy a récemment fait comprendre qu’il n’avait jamais eu l’intention de respecter cet engagement malgré sa participation aux discussions depuis 2021, affirmant ce qui suit aux médias, dans une volte-face, en décembre 2023 : « Je n’avais aucunement l’intention de quitter mes fonctions. Vous savez, je pensais que je partirais lorsque ce serait le bon moment pour la Société. » Tandis que M. Chamandy faisait passer ses intérêts personnels avant ceux de la Société, l’entreprise perdait de son élan et la croissance stagnait. Dans ce contexte de stagnation et en dépit du plan de relève dont il avait été antérieurement convenu, M. Chamandy a demandé au conseil d’approuver une stratégie d’acquisition risquée de plusieurs milliards de dollars qui prévoyait son maintien en poste à titre de chef de la direction pendant plusieurs autres années et a menacé de démissionner et de vendre toutes ses actions si le conseil n’acquiesçait pas à sa demande. Le conseil indépendant ne croyait pas que la stratégie de M. Chamandy était au mieux des intérêts de la Société ou de ses actionnaires. Compte tenu de la menace de démission de M. Chamandy, le conseil a jugé qu’il n’avait d’autre choix que de le démettre de ses fonctions proactivement afin de pouvoir trouver, dès que possible, un successeur qualifié répondant aux besoins actuels de la Société et aux intérêts des actionnaires. Browning West a réagi au départ de M. Chamandy presque instantanément, ce qui, de l’avis du conseil, démontre un certain degré de préparation ou d’entente avec M. Chamandy. Browning West, par ses commentaires, a répandu une histoire fallacieuse en ce qui concerne tant le processus de relève du chef de la direction que le nouveau chef de la direction de la Société. Les actionnaires auraient raison de se demander si M. Chamandy et Browning West avaient savamment orchestré un plan visant à susciter le plus de bruit et de chaos possible autour du départ de M. Chamandy dans le but de miner le conseil et la Société. La mission était simple : créer de toutes pièces une histoire fallacieuse qui servirait de prétexte au lancement d’une course aux procurations visant la prise de contrôle du conseil et de la Société, sans payer de prime, et à la réintégration de M. Chamandy en tant que chef de la direction accompagné d’un conseil plus complaisant. Au cours des cinq derniers mois, le conseil de Gildan a interagi avec les actionnaires de la Société et a accueilli avec intérêt l’opinion des actionnaires de la Société, notamment Browning West et ceux qui l’appuyaient. Après un peu moins de 90 rencontres, il est apparu clairement qu’aucun soutien unanime n’existait envers Browning West et ses candidats, même parmi les appuis que Browning West avait publiquement désignés. Plus précisément, des préoccupations ont été soulevées concernant un éventuel retour de M. Chamandy au sein de la Société, le fait que les candidats aient été sélectionnés par Browning West sans demander l’avis d’autres actionnaires et l’octroi à Browning West d’un contrôle sans restriction de la Société. Il est devenu évident que le type de conseil que les actionnaires souhaitaient mettre en place était un conseil mettant de l’avant la création de valeur en alliant nouvelles perspectives et connaissances historiques; un conseil composé de membres possédant de l’expérience à titre d’administrateurs, notamment de l’expérience en gouvernance, dans le secteur et en fabrication et un conseil à l’écoute des points de vue des actionnaires. Les actionnaires nous ont également affirmé qu’ils souhaitaient avoir un conseil concentré qui travaille dans la collaboration. En s’appuyant sur cette rétroaction importante des actionnaires, le comité de la gouvernance, comprenant des membres qui n’étaient pas la cible de Browning West, a proposé les nouveaux candidats indépendants susmentionnés dans la liste de candidats aux postes d’administrateurs de cette année afin de continuer à respecter l’engagement de la Société envers un renouvellement continu du conseil. Cette liste permet d’atteindre un équilibre entre la continuité avec le passé au cours d’une période de transition et l’apport de nouvelles perspectives afin que le conseil puisse continuer de s’acquitter de son importante tâche de surveillance pour le compte de tous les actionnaires. Il est essentiel que les actionnaires comprennent que le conseil a indiqué à Browning West sa volonté d’amorcer un processus de renouvellement équilibré tenant compte non seulement de son point de vue, mais également de ceux des autres actionnaires. Malheureusement, Browning West a exprimé clairement que les seuls changements qu’elle était disposée à accepter étaient des changements qui profiteraient exclusivement à Browning West, prolongeant cette course aux procurations inutile. En dépit de l’intransigeance de Browning West, le comité de la gouvernance a tenté de rencontrer certains des candidats de Browning West pour discuter de leur possible nomination au conseil avant l’assemblée des actionnaires. Bien que certains candidats se soient montrés ouverts à cette idée, Browning West a empêché ses candidats de participer à ces rencontres. Malgré tout, le comité de la gouvernance a examiné les qualifications et les compétences de candidats de la liste de Browning West afin de s’assurer que ceux qui seraient présentés aux actionnaires lors de l’assemblée des actionnaires de cette année cadraient bien avec le désir de présenter des candidats qui soient représentatifs de l’actionnariat et formaient le conseil le plus solide qu’il serait possible de mettre sur pied. Au terme de cette évaluation, après délibération et compte tenu des commentaires reçus de sources externes, le conseil a conclu que Karen Stuckey et J.P. Towner possédaient des compétences qui lui seraient utiles et a donc recommandé que leur candidature soit appuyée. Au terme du même processus, il a été déterminé que les autres candidats de la liste de Browning West apporteraient des compétences qui feraient tout simplement double emploi ou entraveraient l’élan actuel de Gildan. Browning West continue de mener une campagne coûteuse et perturbatrice fondée sur de fausses hypothèses et des déclarations trompeuses.  L’intervention de Browning West dans les affaires de Gildan devrait inquiéter chaque actionnaire. Ne détenant qu’une faible position dans le capital-actions de Gildan, l’activiste tente de prendre le contrôle à la fois du conseil et de la Société, le tout sans payer de prime. Browning West semble avoir violé la loi américaine en accroissant sa position dans Gildan afin de pouvoir demander la convocation d’une assemblée extraordinaire, avant de retirer sa demande de convocation d’assemblée lorsque le conseil a avisé Browning West et les organismes de réglementation américains de la violation. Le fait que Browning West ait monté en épingle un faux scandale digne de la presse à sensation pour marquer des points dans la course aux procurations est tout aussi inquiétant. Browning West est prête à utiliser tous les coups, aussi bas puissent-ils être, pour obtenir le contrôle de Gildan. Les actionnaires qui ont à cœur les questions de gouvernance ont raison de se demander à quoi ce comportement donnera lieu si Browning West prend le contrôle du conseil. Concernant ses antécédents en matière d’activisme, Browning West a procuré des résultats extrêmement volatils à ses propres investisseurs, laissant les sociétés victimes de ses campagnes en proie au chaos. Ces antécédents devraient servir d’avertissement eu égard à ce qui suit : Au cours des derniers mois, le conseil a tenté de parvenir à un règlement avec Browning West et a offert à maintes reprises d’interviewer les candidats de Browning West afin que le conseil puisse envisager la possibilité de proposer leur candidature à l’assemblée annuelle de 2024. Les efforts de bonne foi de la Société ont été rabroués à chaque occasion par le fonds de couverture activiste. Quoi qu’il en soit, nous avons estimé qu’il était crucial de nous assurer que la composition du conseil reflète les discussions que nous avons eues avec les actionnaires; c’est pourquoi nous avons recommandé que les actionnaires votent pour Karen Stuckey et J.P. Towner. Nous ne pensons pas que les autres candidats de la liste de Browning West apportent des connaissances ou de l’expérience aux activités de Gildan; par conséquent, ils ne représentent pas la meilleure combinaison de candidats aux postes d’administrateurs. De fait, nous croyons qu’un vote pour Peter Lee ou Glenn Chamandy serait un vote contre tout le travail accompli par le comité de la gouvernance en vue de former un conseil renouvelé et collaboratif qui est supérieur à la liste de candidats de Browning West et répond aux souhaits des actionnaires. Si cette course aux procurations porte sur la gouvernance et l’avenir de la Société comme l’affirme Browning West, alors les actionnaires devraient appuyer les candidats de la Société. Donner le contrôle absolu de la Société à Browning West et lui accorder le conseil et le chef de la direction qu’elle a choisis sans contrepoids – ce sur quoi les actionnaires ont exprimé des préoccupations – n’est pas dans l’intérêt de la Société. En conclusion : Le chef de la direction Vince Tyra et un conseil renouvelé doté d’une stratégie convaincante permettront à Gildan de réaliser son plein potentiel. Gildan est dotée du bon chef de la direction, d’un plan solide et d’un conseil nouvellement renouvelé, fort, engagé et diversifié présentant un équilibre entre différents éléments comme l’expérience, les connaissances, l’expérience à titre de membre de la direction et de nouvelles perspectives en vue d’accroître la valeur pour les actionnaires. Le conseil appuie totalement M. Tyra dans son rôle de chef de la direction et se réjouit à l’idée de l’aider à continuer à exécuter et à améliorer la stratégie de la Société. Nous invitons les actionnaires à appuyer M. Tyra dans la réalisation de notre vision à long terme ainsi que notre conseil, récemment renouvelé, dont les membres sont hautement compétents et reconnus.

    "title": "Paul Singer’s activist hedge fund Elliott Management follows Warren Buffett to Japan with a big stake in trading house Sumitomo",
    "description": "Japan is one of the hottest markets for activist investing.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-29T09:49:58Z",
    "content": "Elliott Management Corp. has built a “large” stake in Sumitomo Corp., one of Warren Buffett’s favorite Japanese trading houses, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The size of the activist group’s investment is around “several tens of billions of yen,” the person said, asking not to be identified because the transaction hasn’t been publicly disclosed. Every ¥10 billion ($64 million) investment is equivalent to a 0.2% stake in Sumitomo, based on Friday’s closing share price of ¥3,909. Japanese markets were closed for a public holiday Monday. Japan is one of the hottest markets for activist investing, with the government and institutions such as the Tokyo Stock Exchange asking companies to better manage balance sheets and retool business strategies to boost shareholder returns. Elliott — founded by billionaire Paul Singer — recently focused on developer Mitsui Fudosan Co., after previously targeting Toshiba Corp., SoftBank Group Corp. and Dai Nippon Printing Co. Elliott has engaged with Sumitomo and shared its views on ways to create shareholder value, the person familiar told Bloomberg. It is unclear when the fund accumulated its stake in Sumitomo, or when the discussions took place. A representative for Elliott declined to comment, while Sumitomo said it doesn’t comment on shareholders. Given activist pressure, “lagging trading companies should need to not just take care of their own large project risks, but are also subject to pressure to pay out more,” said Kelvin Leung, a portfolio manager at Robeco Hong Kong Ltd. “The question remains if management can deliver bolder shareholder-friendly measures and further divestment of non-core and non-performing assets,” he said.  Japanese trading houses’ shares have surged to records since Buffett said a year ago that he would be raising his holdings in them. In February, he said in his letter to investors that the companies follow shareholder-friendly policies that are “superior” to those practiced in the US. Sumitomo shares reached their highest ever last week, and have climbed 27% this year. Sumitomo’s peers also saw their stock prices rally on shareholder returns. In February, Mitsubishi announced a buyback of up to 10% of its shares for ¥500 billion, while Itochu said in April it plans to repurchase about ¥150 billion of stock. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. holds about 8.3% of Sumitomo, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also invests in other trading firms including Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui & Co., Itochu Corp. and Marubeni Corp., and has said it hopes to eventually own 9.9% of each.  Sumitomo is Japan’s fourth-largest trading firm with a market capitalization of ¥4.8 trillion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It has a price-to-book ratio of 1.1 and a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 9.5, both the lowest among its peers. Sumitomo’s fiscal 2023 earnings are due Thursday, when the company is also scheduled to reveal its medium-term business plan. Activism from shareholders has been boosting the broader Japanese equity market, contributing to a rally to record highs. Mitsui Fudosan released a plan in April to sell assets and increase buybacks, two months after news of Elliott’s stake in the firm, while Dai Nippon Printing announced its largest-ever stock buyback in March 2023 following pressure from the activist fund. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

    "content": "\n\n\nApril 29, 2024 05:31 ET\n\n\r\n            | Source:\r\n            \nResearch and Markets\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch and Markets\n Dublin, April  29, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Agrivoltaics Market - A Global and Regional Analysis: Focus on Product, Application, and Competitive Landscape, 2023-2033\" report has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The market is valued at $1,768.8 million in 2022. The market is expected to expand rapidly, reaching an estimated $15,871.6 million by the end of 2033. The global agrivoltaics market, which integrates solar energy production with agricultural practices, is poised for significant growth in the coming years. This growth is driven by several factors, including increasing recognition of the benefits of agrivoltaics in enhancing crop yields, reducing water usage, and maximizing land efficiency. Agrivoltaics offers a sustainable and efficient solution for both energy production and agricultural land use, aligning with the global shift toward more environment-friendly practices.  Companies involved in agrivoltaics can capitalize on this trend by investing in innovative technologies, developing partnerships with farmers and solar energy providers, and leveraging government incentives and policies supporting renewable energy. Strategic investments in research and development, along with the establishment of resilient production infrastructure, will be key for companies looking to capitalize on the expanding agrivoltaics market. By embracing these strategies, companies can position themselves as leaders in sustainable energy solutions for agriculture, shaping the future of the global agrivoltaics market and meeting the evolving needs of farmers and energy consumers worldwide. North America, especially the U.S., plays a pivotal role in shaping the global agrivoltaics market, being a major contributor due to its increasing energy demands and the rising prominence of agrivoltaics as a sustainable energy source. The growth of the agrivoltaics market in the U.S. is expected to accelerate in the coming years, driven by factors such as government support, rising demand for renewable energy, and the benefits it offers to farmers.Industry ImpactsThe utility-scale solar farms, typically ranging from 1 MW to 2,000 MW, are known to sell their electricity to generate profits for their owners. The installation cost of solar farms usually falls between $0.89 to $1.01 per watt. On average, a 1 MW solar farm can earn around $43,500 annually by selling its electricity to utilities. Landowners who lease their land for solar farms can expect to earn between $250 to $3,000 per acre per year. These findings underscore the economic viability and potential profitability of solar farm investments.While comparing agrivoltaics to ground-mounted PV plants, researchers have found that agrivoltaics projects tend to be more expensive. This is primarily due to higher costs incurred during the approval process and design limitations, as well as the need for specialized components such as modules, mounting systems, and trackers. For instance, the inclusion of vertical plants or elevated modules to accommodate agricultural machinery underneath can significantly raise costs. The additional expenses for these components are estimated to range from $268.68 to $303.00 per kW for modules and from $90.7 to $240.6 per kW for racks. Fixed Array to Dominate the Global Agrivoltaics Market (by Array Configuration)The fixed array stands out as the leading segment among the various types of array configurations in the global agrivoltaics market, driven by its practicality, cost-effectiveness, and compatibility with agricultural operations. This segment represents a significant portion of agrivoltaics installations worldwide, offering a balance between solar energy generation and agricultural productivity.One key advantage of fixed arrays is their simplicity and ease of installation, making them a preferred choice for many farmers and solar developers. Unlike tracking systems, fixed arrays do not require complex mechanisms for adjusting the angle of solar panels, reducing maintenance costs and potential points of failure. Furthermore, fixed arrays are well-suited for a variety of agricultural settings, including grassland farming, horticulture, and arable farming, providing flexibility in deployment. Their stationary nature ensures minimal disruption to farming activities, allowing crops to thrive without compromising solar energy generation. Monofacial Solar Panels Segment to Dominate the Global Agrivoltaics Market (by Photovoltaic Technology)Monofacial solar panels have emerged as the leadingly adopted photovoltaic technology in the global agrivoltaics market. This trend is driven by several factors, including cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and compatibility with agricultural activities. Monofacial panels are traditional solar panels that absorb sunlight from one side, making them ideal for installations where space is not a constraint.One recent example highlighting the dominance of monofacial solar panels in agrivoltaics installations is the AgriPV project in the Netherlands, initiated in April 2021. This project involves the installation of monofacial solar panels on a greenhouse to generate solar power while allowing for crop cultivation underneath. The project showcases the efficiency and compatibility of monofacial panels with agricultural settings, as well as their ability to enhance land use efficiency. Pollinator Habitant Segment to Dominate the Global Agrivoltaics Market (by Site of Installation)Pollinator habitat emerges as the leading application segment in the global agrivoltaics market, showcasing a pivotal shift toward sustainable agricultural practices and renewable energy generation. This segment not only promotes biodiversity but also enhances the ecosystem services provided by agrivoltaics systems. How can this report add value to an organization?Product/Innovation Strategy: The market is poised for significant expansion with ongoing technological advancements, increased investments, and growing awareness of the use of agrivoltaics. Therefore, agrivoltaics are a high-investment and high-revenue generating model.Growth/Marketing Strategy: The global agrivoltaics market is growing at a rapid pace. The market offers enormous opportunities for existing and emerging market players. Some of the strategies covered in this segment are mergers and acquisitions, product launches, partnerships and collaborations, business expansions, and investments.

    "published_at": "2024-04-29T05:00:00Z",
    "content": "Warren Buffett’s warning that wildfires have turned utilities across the western US into risky investments is mistaken — at least in California, according to the head of the state’s largest electricity provider. “Frankly, I think Buffett got it wrong in California,” said Patti Poppe, chief executive officer of PG&E Corp., during the company’s investor call Thursday. “California has done the hard work to mitigate both physical and financial risk.” Buffett’s most recent letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholders expressed a reluctance to invest in the company’s western utilities given their exposure to wildfire liability claims. Berkshire’s PacifiCorp utility faces hundreds of millions of dollars of liability costs from Oregon wildfires in 2020. PG&E was driven into bankruptcy in 2019 after a series of deadly fires blamed on its equipment. Poppe pointed to measures California has taken since then to cut fire risk. The state has set up a $21 billion wildfire insurance fund to backstop utilities, put shareholder liability caps on utility wildfire claims and required PG&E to carry out fire prevention plans that include hardening its grid against extreme weather. “The citizens of California have never been safer from wildfire risk, and I think investors will soon come to believe that,” Poppe said. Berkshire Hathaway Energy declined to comment.

A wildfire fueled by gusty Santa Ana winds ripped through rural land southeast of Los Angeles, forcing about 4,000 people from their homes, fire authorities said. \nTopics\nCalifornia\nWildfire\n Was this article valuable?

The CEO of a utility company that sought bankruptcy protections because of the massive, deadly, and expensive wildfires it caused, declares utilities are not a risky investment because of wildfires.

    "title": "Elliot said to own 'large' stake in Warren Buffett’s favourite Sumitomo, Japan’s fourth-largest trading firm",
    "description": "Elliott Management Corp. has built a “large” stake in Sumitomo Corp., one of Warren Buffett’s favourite Japanese trading houses, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-29T01:16:05Z",
    "content": "      Elliott Management Corp. has built a “large\" stake in Sumitomo Corp., one of Warren Buffett’s favourite Japanese trading houses, according to a person familiar with the matter.     The size of the activist group’s investment is around “several tens of billions of yen,\" the person said, asking not to be identified because the transaction hasn’t been publicly disclosed. Every ¥10 billion ($63 million) investment is equivalent to a 0.2% stake in Sumitomo, based on Friday’s closing share price of ¥3,909.    Japan is one of the hottest markets for activist investing, with the government and institutions such as the Tokyo Stock Exchange asking companies to better manage balance sheets and retool business strategies to boost shareholder returns. Elliott — founded by billionaire Paul Singer — recently focused on developer Mitsui Fudosan Co., after previously targeting Toshiba Corp., SoftBank Group Corp. and Dai Nippon Printing Co.    Elliott has engaged with Sumitomo and shared its views on ways to create shareholder value, the person familiar told Bloomberg. It is unclear when the fund accumulated its stake in Sumitomo, or when the discussions took place.    A representative for Elliott declined to comment, while Sumitomo said it doesn’t comment on shareholders.    Japanese trading houses’ shares have surged to records since Buffett said a year ago that he would be raising his holdings in them. In February, he said in his letter to investors that the companies follow shareholder-friendly policies that are “superior\" to those practised in the US. Sumitomo shares reached their highest ever last week, and have climbed 27% this year.  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. holds about 8.3% of Sumitomo, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also invests in other trading firms, including Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui & Co., Itochu Corp., and Marubeni Corp., and ithas said it hopes to eventually own 9.9% of each.     Sumitomo is Japan’s fourth largest trading firm with a market capitalization of ¥4.8 trillion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It has a price-to-book ratio of 1.1 and a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 9.5, both the lowest among its peers. Sumitomo’s fiscal 2023 earnings are due Thursday, when the company is also scheduled to reveal its medium-term business plan.    Sumitomo’s peers also saw their stock prices rally on shareholder returns. In February, Mitsubishi announced a buyback of up to 10% of its shares for ¥500 billion, while Itochu said in April it plans to repurchase about ¥150 billion of stock.    Activism from shareholders has been boosting the broader Japanese equity market, contributing to a rally to record highs.    Mitsui Fudosan released a plan in April to sell assets and increase buybacks, two months after news of Elliott’s stake in the firm, while Dai Nippon Printing announced its largest-ever stock buyback in March 2023 following pressure from the activist fund.

    "content": "The annual Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK)(NYSE:BRK) shareholders meeting attracts thousands of people to Omaha annually to hear from legendary investor Warren Buffett. The 2024 event will feel quite different for those in attendance, with Buffett missing his investing partner Charlie Munger. What Happened: Munger, the former Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman, passed away in November at the age of 99. For the first time, the annual Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting held in Omaha, Nebraska won't feature Buffett with Munger by his side. The 2024 event takes place on Saturday, May 4. The duo traditionally shared highlights of their portfolio and investment strategies and also provided valuable pieces of wisdom about finance and life to those in attendance. One investor told The Wall Street Journal that things will be different Saturday for those in attendance. \"I feel like there's going to be a place in my heart missing when we don't see Charlie up there. Of course we'll adapt to it, but this first year especially it's going to be kind of like an empty-chair feeling,\" Lyle McIntosh said. Buffett has credited Munger with being the brains behind the company, and those in attendance will also remember the one-liners that the investor often had. Munger once said \"if you mix raisins with turds, they're still turds\" at the 2000 annual meeting when speaking about speculation in technology. While Munger won't be on stage with Buffett, other key Berkshire figures could play a more prominent role. Greg Abel, who runs the noninsurance operations for Berkshire, is next in line to Buffett's CEO role and will appear on stage. Insurance head Ajit Jain will also be featured at the event. Related Link: Charlie Munger Shared A Three Word Piece Of Advice At A Dinner, How It Helped An Investor And Was Also Used By Warren Buffett Why It's Important: Known as the \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" the annual shareholders meeting has been attended by many investors for years and often attracts first timers who own shares of the popular conglomerate to the event in hopes of meeting and hearing from Buffett. Munger and Buffett worked together for decades and were often viewed as close friends or family by those who witnessed their interactions together. Buffett once said that he had never had an argument with Munger. In February, Buffett shared a touching tribute to Munger in a letter to shareholders. Buffett called Munger the \"architect\" who worked behind the scenes of building up Berkshire Hathaway. \"In a way his relationship with me was part older brother, part loving father,\" Buffett said in the letter. Buffett praised Munger for his selfless advice during the early years of his leadership at Berkshire Hathaway. \"Charlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me take the bows and receive the accolades.\" BRK-B Price Action: Berkshire Hathaway shares trade at $398.26 versus a 52-week trading range of $317.41 to $430.00.

    "content": "Главная - Новости - Не только Paramount: CEO в США массово уходят с должностей — из-за стрессов, давления и одиночества \nАндрей Русанов\n Автор сайта \n\n\n\n Сейчас не лучшее время быть CEO, судя по волне увольнений, которые происходят в США в последнее время. Ноэль Куинн из банка HSBC неожиданно объявил во вторник, что уйдет в отставку с поста руководителя, когда правление выберет его преемника. Боб Бакиш из Paramount Global ушел в отставку из медиа-гиганта в понедельник, а Кенни Уилсон из Dr Martens недавно заявил, что это будет последний год его руководства обувной компанией. Их уход является частью более широкой тенденции. В прошлом квартале в американских компаниях сменилось рекордное количество CEO — 622. Это на на 48% больше, чем за тот же период прошлого года, и на 27% больше, чем в прошлом квартале. Об этом сообщает кадровая фирма Challenger, Gray & Christmas, которая отслеживает эти изменения с 2002 года. «Лидеры уровня C пережили невероятно сложные годы, и они отходят от своих ролей ради новых возможностей или чтобы начать новую жизнь в другом месте», — комментирует Эндрю Челленджер, старший вице-президент компании. CEO Tesla и SpaceX Илон Маск жаловался, что управлять компанией «на самом деле не так весело», а порой «просто ужасно». По его словам, генеральные директора обременены «самыми ужасными проблемами в компании», которые никто другой не может решить. В 2022 году Маск также пожаловался, что иногда чувствует себя «довольно одиноким», если он живет один во время работы над проектом и даже не имеет собаки для общения. Сочетание огромного давления, стресса, одиночества и отсутствия баланса между работой и личной жизнью, которое часто сопровождает работу генерального директора, вполне может объяснить, почему немногие люди долго остаются на этой должности. Но в каждой тенденции есть исключения: Уоррен Баффет является генеральным директором Berkshire Hathaway более полувека. 93-летний мужчина, по-видимому, продержался так долго, потому что он нанимает целую армию генеральных директоров, чтобы управлять многими компаниями, которые он приобрел за многие годы. «Мы делегируем почти до момента отречения», — написал он в своем «Руководстве владельца». Передача ежедневных обязанностей позволяет Баффету сосредоточиться на том, что он любит делать: распределение капитала внутри и за пределами своей компании.

    "description": "One-thousand Oregon wildfire victims are suing PacifiCorp for $30 billion in the latest lawsuit filed over impacts from the 2020 wildfires.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-30T16:17:55Z",
    "content": "One-thousand Oregon wildfire survivors are suing PacifiCorp for $30 billion in the latest lawsuit filed as part of the massive class action lawsuit over the 2020 Labor Day wildfires. The complaint, filed Monday in Multnomah County court, lists 1,000 names of people impacted by four wildfires that a jury last year found the utility at fault for causing. Victims are each seeking up to $5 million for economic damages, such as property or home loss, and up to $25 million for non-economic losses such as emotional distress. In June 2023, a Multnomah County jury found PacifiCorp at fault for the ignition and spread of the Santiam-Beachie, Echo Mountain, South Obenchain and 242 fires. In that first case, the jury awarded $90 million to 17 wildfire survivors. The jury also ruled PacifiCorp was negligent to an entire class of about 2,500 properties or 5,000 people. Since the original verdict, a series of \"mini-trials\" have moved forward with members of the class represented. In those cases, juries have awarded 18 plaintiffs $130 million. The average award has been around $6 million. The latest filing includes a much larger group and is known as a \"mass complaint.\" It comes as the two sides — lawyers for wildfire survivors and PacifiCorp — are engaged in mediation ordered by the court. PacifiCorp, Oregon's second largest utility, is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. There are no pending trials between the two sides and it's unclear how or when the 1,000 people listed in the complaint would move through the court system. PacifiCorp has been steadfast that it will appeal the original jury's verdict. The utility objected to numerous aspects of the proceedings, both during the original trial, after the June verdict and during this year's mini-trials. The company said it has filed an appeal on the “numerous issues stemming from the June 2023 court proceeding and intends to appeal this latest outcome because many of the fundamental problems with this case persist.” Through in late February, the Portland-based utility had paid $735 million to settle wildfire claims by several hundred people and 10 timber companies. Buffett warned last year in his annual shareholder letter that wildfires could threaten the survival of utilities in a few states, an outcome he had not anticipated, Reuters reported. Most recently, PacifiCorp settled with two Santiam Canyon timber companies — Freres Timber Co. and CW Specialty Lumber Co. — for an undisclosed amount of money.

    "content": "Warren Buffett’s annual address to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders this Saturday is going to be missing something. The death of his longtime business partner Charlie Munger last November at the age of 99 was the end of an era—and while Buffett won’t be on stage alone, the back-and-forth conversations aren’t likely to be as sarcastic or as warm. Greg Abel, who runs Berkshire’s noninsurance operations and is expected to eventually succeed Buffett as CEO, is slated to join Buffett this weekend, along with Ajit Jain, who heads the insurance business. Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting has been called “Woodstock for Capitalists.” It’s a three-day event that offers everything from shopping to a 5K race to a picnic and draws as many as 40,000 people from around the world each year. Some come for the festival. Some for the celebrity (Apple’s Tim Cook and actor Bill Murray have popped by in the past). But most, traditionally, have come to listen to Buffett and Munger offer their thoughts on investing and the current climate. “Charlie and I are shameless,” Buffett wrote in his letter to shareholders last year. “Last year, at our first shareholder get-together in three years, we greeted you with our usual commercial hustle. From the opening bell, we went straight for your wallet. In short order, our See’s kiosk sold you eleven tons of nourishing peanut brittle and chocolates. In our P.T. Barnum pitch, we promised you longevity. After all, what else but candy from See’s could account for Charlie and me making it to 99 and 92?” Munger passed away days before his 100th birthday. He and Buffett met when they both worked at a grocery store owned by Buffett’s grandfather as teenagers, but didn’t realize it until 1959. But it wasn’t until 1978 that they began to make magic, when Munger joined Berkshire Hathaway as vice chairman. “The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices,” Buffett wrote in the company’s 2015 shareholder letter. “Altering my behavior is not an easy task (ask my family). I had enjoyed reasonable success without Charlie’s input, so why should I listen to a lawyer who had never spent a day in business school (when – ahem – I had attended three). But Charlie never tired of repeating his maxims about business and investing to me, and his logic was irrefutable. Consequently, Berkshire has been built to Charlie’s blueprint.” In February’s letter to shareholders, Buffett paid tribute to his partner, saying “Charlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me take the bows and receive the accolades. In a way his relationship with me was part older brother, part loving father. … Though I have long been in charge of the construction crew; Charlie should forever be credited with being the architect.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Higher crude supply thanks to Mexico’s U-turn on its export cuts and hotter-than-expected US inflation data have added some bearish sentiment into the markets, with no real macroeconomic or geopolitical upside on the horizon now.  Houthis Strike Ships Again. Yemen’s Houthi militias have targeted four ships in a string of missile attacks this week, including the MSC Orion container ship partly owned by Israeli businessman Eyal Ofer, the Greek-operated Cyclades commercial tanker and two US destroyers passing through the Indian Ocean.  G7 Agrees on 2035 Deadline for Coal.

As shippers have expressed their concerns regarding the readiness of the TMX pipeline to start commercial operations on May 1, Canada’s CER said there are still six leave-to-open applications left to consider for pump stations and pipeline spreads.   Related: Weak Diesel Demand Has Traders Hunting for East Coast Storage Mexico Reverses Crude Export Cuts. Mexico’s state-controlled oil company Pemex has walked back its crude export cuts for May after both the Salina Cruz and Veracruz refineries suffered fires over the past two weeks, eliminating the necessity to lower May exports by the planned 330,000 b/d. India Goes for Canadian Crude. Reliance Industries, India’s largest refiner, bought a VLCC cargo of Canadian crude from Shell (LON:SHEL) for July delivery, marking the first ever purchase of TMX volumes by an Indian buyer, with reports suggesting the price was set at a $6 per barrel discount to ICE Brent.  Saudi Arabia on the Hunt for Lithium. As Riyadh builds up its muscle in the metals industry, Saudi Arabia is looking to lock in supply deals to source lithium into its nascent EV battery industry, with media reports suggesting Chile might be the preferred country for future investments. \nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n ADVERTISEMENT ExxonMobil Eyes Turkish LNG Opportunities. Turkey is negotiating with US oil major ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) to derisk its LNG supply from the usual sellers (Algeria, Qatar, US) and create a “new supply portfolio”, aiming for a 2.5 mtpa LNG term deal should they agree on commercial terms.  Fading Middle East Risks Lower Oil Appetite. Hedge funds and other money managers sold the equivalent of 95 million barrels in the six key crude options and futures in the week ending April 23, the largest weekly drop since October 2023 as lower Israel-Iran war risks led to weaker risk appetite. Drought Risks Loom Large Over Copper. According to a PWC report, more than half of the world’s copper mines in Chile, Zambia and elsewhere are in areas exposed to drought risks over the next decades, stoking fears that climate-related disruptions could add to the already bullish case on copper prices.Argentina Could be The Next Oil Frontier. A consortium led by Norway’s Equinor (NYSE:EQNR) will drill a deepwater exploration well off Argentina’s northern coast, with the Argerich wildcat becoming the first ever deepwater well in the country, potentially opening up an untapped frontier.  Southeast Asia Struggles with Scorching Heat.

    "content": "search Price cuts are spurring record deals from Miami Beach to Palm Beach SHARE THIS ARTICLE FONT SIZE Sitting on the couch in the staged living room of the Tarpon Island estate in Palm Beach, Todd Michael Glaser seemed befuddled.  “I don’t know why Tarpon hasn’t sold yet,” the spec developer said in February, shaking his head as he mused about the market between calls.  Tarpon is a 21,400-square-foot renovated megamansion, with 11 bedrooms, 15 full bathrooms, two kitchens, a home office, tennis court, gym, salon and spa, two pools, a hot tub and cold plunge, sitting on a 2.3-acre private island. It has room to fit staff, in-laws, a catering team and more. It should check all the boxes for the typical ultra-rich homebuyer.  In 2021, Glaser and his partners, Jim Randall, Scott Robins and Jonathan Fryd, bought the private island for $85 million. A year later they listed it for $218 million, with grandiose visions.  “This is a house for Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg,” Glaser told The Real Deal at the time. After an unsuccessful first season, it returned to the market at the reduced price of $187.5 million.  Glaser’s luck changed about a month ago, when Tarpon went into contract. The sale is expected to close soon, and it will mark one of the priciest ever in Florida. It also signifies the true start of the region’s busiest season. After a string of record years during the pandemic that were followed by a dropoff in sales, South Florida agents say this season is delayed and inconsistent, but definitely still better than other top luxury markets. Price cuts are spurring sales, as buyers are expected to jump into the market as summer approaches.  “We got a late start is really what it comes down to,” said Dana Koch, an agent with the Corcoran Group in Palm Beach. “There’s definitely been some momentum, but it ebbs and flows very oddly.” As price reductions have become more common, the pricing gap between buyers and sellers of ultra-luxury homes in South Florida has narrowed, resulting in a boost in activity at the very high end over the last two-plus months. Each deal creates momentum for the next. But inventory is still wonky, agents say.  Housing analyst Jonathan Miller said the luxury market is in a “slow grind.” Pricing has fallen, but it’s still up, compared to pre-pandemic. High interest rates and elevated pricing are keeping sales below pandemic highs. And the upcoming election and slow summer season suggest the boost in activity could be short-lived.  In Miami Beach and other barrier island markets including Bal Harbour and Indian Creek, 10 luxury single-family home sales closed in the first quarter, up 25 percent from eight sales during the same period of last year, according to the Miller-authored Douglas Elliman reports. Still, the median price for luxury homes fell 28 percent to just over $13 million. The reports define luxury as the top 10 percent of deals. Inventory and months of supply also rose.  In Palm Beach, the overall number of single-family home sales and their median price each rose in the same time period. Isolating the top 10 percent of the market, luxury home and condo sales fell 10 percent to nine closings; and the median price fell 18 percent to $14 million.  “Part of this decline is attributable to a shift in the mix, in terms of what’s selling. Even though the median price is down, it’s still … higher than pre-pandemic,” Miller said. “The numbers are still elevated, but choppy.”  South Florida’s major luxury deals were concentrated in Palm Beach and Miami Beach this season, though a handful of sales scattered across South Florida’s waterways are still setting records.  Even sales of vacant lots have picked up. Those deals are often more challenging because of the cost and time associated with building. Dora Puig, top broker and owner of Luxe Living Realty, said teardowns and land sales are being “really negotiated.” In April, billionaire Barry Diller paid $45 million for the 1.5-acre waterfront lot at 5930 North Bay Road, a record for the waterfront Miami Beach street. Nearby, an assemblage of waterfront land at 18 La Gorce Circle, asking $132 million, is in contract to two buyers after the price was reduced twice from the original $170 million asking price. Both of those deals include homes that the buyers are expected to tear down and replace with new mansions.  Buyers are looking at the usual areas: the Sunset and Venetian islands, North Bay Road, La Gorce, Star Island and Indian Creek, said top Douglas Elliman agent Dina Goldentayer.  Diller’s buy and billionaire Teddy Sagi’s pending $24 million purchase of a teardown at 4521 Pine Tree Drive show that buyers are willing to spend big money on vacant lots again.  “Two big sales is enough for everyone to be excited,” Goldentayer said.  In another private island deal, billionaire Jeff Bezos dropped $90 million on a third waterfront Indian Creek Village estate in March. The Amazon founder had been in the market for a home he could live in while he has a mansion built on a double lot on the island that he assembled last year for nearly $150 million.  The activity has spilled over to condos, too. In Surfside, a penthouse at the Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club sold for $44 million, a record $6,000 per square foot.  Goldentayer sees consistent demand for properties priced at $20 million and up.  “The demand continues [for] uber-wealthy new residents re-domiciling, and they want something special,” she said.  Brokers say they’re seeing multiple buyers expressing interest, especially following a price cut, but not necessarily pulling the trigger. “In each of those markets, there seems to be a good number of buyers,” said Danny Hertzberg, of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker, who is representing the seller in the pending La Gorce deal. “That doesn’t mean they’ll overpay.”  Aside from Tarpon Island, big Palm Beach deals include Nvidia board member Harvey Jones’ $74.3 million purchase of a 1-acre lakefront estate, which closed in March. Earlier this month, a hidden buyer dropped $85 million to acquire Ideavillage founder Anand Khubani’s oceanfront 1-acre lot at 108 El Mirasol.  The deals that have closed are spurring more activity, agents say.  “It churns the soil up underneath, it electrifies things,” said Douglas Elliman’s Chris Leavitt, who is co-listing Tarpon Island. Pricey listings selling can “give the property down the street a little boost.” Prospective buyers are keeping a close eye on homes they’re interested in — sometimes by boat. When some such trophy properties go into contract, those who missed out want to be notified if the deal falls through.  They’re “a little bit nervous, waiting and hesitating and losing the property they want,” Hertzberg said. “But at the same time we’re not back to [the buying frenzy of] 2021.”  Miller referred to these buyers as “luxury lurkers.” They want to buy, but feel less urgency.  Puig said she has a waitlist of nine buyers who want to see her $80 million listing at 4736 North Bay Road, a waterfront estate under construction that developer Niklas de la Motte was building for himself.  Nelson Gonzalez, a top agent with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty, said “huge demand” still exists. “It’s just the very high-end buyers thinking the market is going to come down.”  Some properties are selling at record prices, and some are experiencing price cuts.  After a year on the market asking $200 million, cosmetics heir William Lauder slashed the price for two oceanfront lots in Palm Beach. Rather than sell them together, he’s now looking for two buyers at $88.9 million each. He also tapped Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate to take over the listing from Premier Estate Properties’ Jim McCann. At the end of the day, the asking price is a test.  “It’s all over the board. I have denied some listings because of the seller’s desired asking price. I don’t want to waste my time or theirs,” said Elliman agent Samantha Curry. “There’s also some sellers that will say ‘I don’t know where the market is, so let’s try this number.’”  Brokers expect they’ll have a little more time to find the sweet spot on pricing this season. Given the slow start and recent burst of activity, deals could keep closing past Memorial Day. “I anticipate this season trending later this year,” said Premier Estate Properties agent Margit Brandt, who is representing the buyer in the pending Tarpon Island deal. “There’ll be a lot of closings in June and July.” Even with the extension, buyers and sellers are still rushing to get deals done before they head to their summer homes. “There’s a major push right now,” Leavitt said. “It’s almost like a scurry to purchase before people leave.” All rights reserved © 2024 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc."

    "title": "Walmart to close 51 clinics as it shutters its entire Walmart Health division",
    "description": "Walmart will close all 51 of its doctor-staffed health clinics as part of an announcement that its Walmart Health initiative is shutting down.",
    "published_at": "2024-04-30T13:56:39Z",
    "content": " Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time Walmart will close all 51 of its doctor-staffed health clinics as part of an announcement that its Walmart Health initiative is shutting down.    The clinics, in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois and Texas, had been open just a few years. Walmart also said Tuesday it is winding down its virtual care option. Walmart pharmacies and vision centers will not be affected. Patients with scheduled appointments will continue to be seen, and Walmart will make efforts to direct patients to high-quality providers in their insurance networks to ensure they continue to get care, CNBC reported. The announcement is a swift reversal for the retail giant. Just last month, Walmart said it hoped to expand the number of doctor-staffed clinics to 70 by the end of this year. But amid rising costs and competition, the company determined it could not financially justify the effort.  “Through our experience managing Walmart Health centers and Walmart Health Virtual Care, we determined there is not a sustainable business model for us to continue,” the company said Tuesday in a statement announcing the move. Offering health care services has proven difficult for nontraditional providers.  Last month, Walgreens said it had closed 140 of its VillageMD primary care clinics, with plans to shutter 20 more. A high-profile joint health venture among Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase also failed several years ago, though Amazon continues to invest in One Medical, which it acquired last year and which has more than 125 locations. About half the Walmart Health clinics were in Florida, and last fall Walmart announced a partnership with Orlando Health, a private, not-for-profit network of community and specialty hospitals. That effort, too, is winding down, CNBC reported. Rob Wile is a breaking business news reporter for NBC News Digital. © 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL"

    "content": "By Jonathan Stempel (Reuters) - A utility owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway faces $30 billion of new claims blaming it for causing Oregon wildfires in 2020, nearly four times the maximum loss it had projected. One thousand victims filed claims against the PacifiCorp utility on Monday in a state court in Portland. Victims are each seeking up to $5 million for actual losses such as property damage, and up to $25 million for non-economic losses such as emotional distress. The claimants were added to litigation where a jury last June ordered PacifiCorp to pay $90 million to 17 claimants for gross negligence over its failure to shut down power lines during a Labor Day windstorm. PacifiCorp is appealing. Through late February, the Portland-based utility had paid $735 million to settle wildfire claims by several hundred people and 10 timber companies. Neither PacifiCorp nor its immediate parent Berkshire Hathaway Energy immediately responded on Tuesday to requests for comment. Buffett's conglomerate owns 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. The claims were filed two months after Buffett warned in his annual shareholder letter that wildfires could threaten the survival of utilities in a few states, an outcome he had not anticipated. Buffett singled out California's Pacific Gas & Electric, which filed for bankruptcy in 2019, and Hawaiian Electric, which faces many lawsuits over last August's wildfires in Maui. Berkshire ended 2023 with $2.4 billion of projected wildfire losses, and has said they could grow to $8 billion. The federal government is seeking nearly $1 billion from PacifiCorp to cover costs of multiple wildfires in Oregon and Northern California, and has threatened a lawsuit. Berkshire bought PacifiCorp for $5.1 billion in 2006. The case is Henson et al v PacifiCorp et al, Oregon Circuit Court, Multnomah County, No. 20CV33885.

    "published_at": "2024-04-30T11:44:37Z",
    "content": "       It's a tough time to be a CEO, if the crowd of people quitting the top job is any indication. HSBC's Noel Quinn unexpectedly announced Tuesday that he'd step down as the bank's boss once its board picked his successor. Paramount Global's Bob Bakish resigned from the media titan on Monday, while Dr. Martens' Kenny Wilson recently said this would be his final year in charge of the footwear company. Their departures are part of a broader trend. There were a record 622 CEO changes at US companies last quarter, a 48% rise from the same period last year and a 27% increase from last quarter. That's according to the staffing firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which has been tracking those moves since 2002. \"C-Level leaders have had an incredibly challenging few years, and are transitioning out of their roles, whether for new opportunities or to get fresh starts elsewhere,\" Andrew Challenger, the company's senior vice president, said in the latest report. \"Rapid technological advancements, in addition to an election year, may make it a palatable time to make changes at the top,\" Challenger added. In recent years, corporate chiefs have contended with everything from labor shortages and strikes to layoffs and culture wars, conflicts, the remote-working boom, snarled supply chains, pandemic shutdowns, historic inflation, surging interest rates, and a deeply uncertain economic outlook. \n                              Related stories\n                             Perhaps it's no wonder that the median tenure for S&P 500 bosses fell from six years in 2013 to below five years in 2022, one analysis of CEO longevity found. Head honchos have been calling out the difficulties of their jobs for years. \"Being a CEO sucks,\" Emad Mostaque, the former boss of Stability AI, said in March. \"After an intense five years, it is now the right time for me to get a better balance between my personal and business life,\" HSBC's Quinn said Tuesday in a press release, underscoring how top dogs struggle to juggle their jobs with their other responsibilities. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has bemoaned that running a company is \"really not that fun\" and \"just awful\" at times. CEOs are burdened with the \"crappiest problems in the company\" that nobody else can solve, he said. Musk also lamented in 2022 that he sometimes felt \"quite lonely\" if he was living alone while working on a project and didn't even have his dog for companionship. Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has had a similar experience. \"The depths of loneliness I experienced as a CEO are difficult to put into words,\" he posted on X in January. The combination of immense pressure, stress, loneliness, and lack of work-life balance that often comes with being a CEO may well explain why few people last long in the role. The raft of recent challenges likely fueled last quarter's exodus from the top job. But there are exceptions to every trend: Warren Buffett has been the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway for more than half a century. The 93-year-old has probably lasted so long because he employs an army of CEOs to manage the scores of businesses he's acquired over the years. \"We delegate almost to the point of abdication,\" he wrote in his \"Owner's Manual\" for Berkshire shareholders. Handing off daily responsibilities lets Buffett focus on what he loves to do: allocate capital within and outside his company. Axel Springer, Insider Inc.'s parent company, is an investor in Airbnb. \n                              More from Theron Mohamed\n                             Jump to"

Walmart will close 51 clinic locations across Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois and Texas, plans that won't affect the company's 4,600 pharmacies and more than 3,000 vision centers, the company said in a release. The clinics will close over the next 45 to 90 days, two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named told CNBC.  Walmart blamed its plans to shutter clinics on a broken business model. In the release, it described the move as \"a difficult decision,\" but said it couldn't operate a profitable business because of \"the challenging reimbursement environment and escalating operating costs.\" The shortage of health-care workers in the U.S. has also increased the company's labor costs, according to the sources familiar with the matter.  The announcement comes just a month after Walmart said it planned to double the size of its clinic footprint by opening up 22 new locations this year and more in 2025.  Walmart's announcement is also another sign of how challenging it is to disrupt and radically improve American health care – an expensive, complicated and entrenched system of doctors, insurers, drug manufacturers and other players that costs the nation more than $4 trillion a year.  Walmart opened its first Walmart Health clinic in Georgia in 2019, and then gradually opened more clinics next door to its big-box stores. Customers, who typically shopped Walmart's aisles for groceries or household items, could also stop by for a doctor or dentist appointment or therapy session. The clinics offered other services, too, such as flu tests, X-rays and stiches. Those health-care services came with a low price tag, such as $30 for an annual check-up for adults, $45 for a 45-minute counseling session or as little as $25 for an adult teeth cleaning. At a conference in fall 2019, then-Walmart CFO Brett Biggs touted the company's ambitions to investors. He referred to how Walmart had used its large size to bring down the price of many common generic drugs to as low as $4 at its pharmacies and planned to do that for other parts of health care. \"It's more than test and learn because we know that this is a place we can have a massive difference on how people live,\" he told investors at the time. \"When we think about 'Save money, live better,' we can do both with what we can do in healthcare. And so, we plan to be a big player going forward in what happens in healthcare.\" Yet in the following years, Walmart opened new clinics at a slow pace and faced new challenges and competitive dynamics — including keeping its store shelves stocked and locations staffed during the Covid-19 pandemic. Walmart struggled with high executive turnover and cycled through numerous leaders of Walmart Health. And CVS Health, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Amazon all announced their own ambitions to open or acquire doctor offices. Amazon last year closed a $3.9 billion deal to buy primary-care provider One Medical. Meanwhile, on earnings calls and at investor meetings, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon and other company leaders instead highlighted other emerging and higher-margin businesses, such as its growing advertising business and its third-party marketplace. Going forward, Walmart will return to the health services it offered before the Walmart Health push: It will continue to operate its thousands of pharmacies and vision centers. Walmart said its clinics will continue to see patients with scheduled appointments until their doors close, the people familiar with the matter told CNBC. The company will also help patients find high-quality providers in their insurance networks to ensure they continue to get care, the people said. Walmart Health marks the latest failed push into health care by a high-profile company, following the disbandment of a joint venture between JPMorgan Chase, Berkshire Hathaway and Amazon in 2021.  Before it announced the closures, Walmart was among a slate of retail giants racing to build up their primary-care presence as demand grows for convenient and affordable medical care. Walmart grew its clinic business at a slower pace than its competitors, but some companies have struggled to balance their expansion plans with their swelling networks of patients.  Walgreens said in March it had closed 140 of its VillageMD primary-care clinics and plans to shutter 20 more to boost the profitability of its broader health-care division. Walgreens also recorded a nearly $6 billion charge in the first quarter related to the decline in value of VillageMD, which has generated disappointing returns since the company became a majority owner of the business in 2021.  Meanwhile, Amazon's health clinic operator One Medical now has more than 125 locations nationwide. Walmart has made several other plays in the health-care space, including partnering with an insurer and health system on care coordination in Florida. But Walmart will no longer see patients under that partnership moving forward, according to the two sources familiar with the matter. Walmart bought a chronic condition management platform called CareZone in 2020 for an undisclosed amount.  Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File photo TOKYO :     U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management Corp has bought a stake in Sumitomo Corp worth several tens of billions of yen, a person familiar with the situation said on Tuesday. The purchase follows Warren Buffett's closely watched investment in the Japanese trading house. The person did not give an exact figure for the Sumitomo transaction and asked not to be identified because the purchase has not been publicly disclosed. Ten billion yen is equal to around $64 million. Sumitomo declined to comment. Excitement among global investors over long-awaited corporate governance changes and improved shareholder returns at Japanese companies has pushed share prices to records and fuelled a spate of activist investor campaigns in recent years. Elliott is one of the world's most influential activist investors and has been proactive in Japan, recently targeting automotive battery component supplier Dai Nippon Printing and real estate developer Mitsui Fudosan. Legendary investor Warren Buffett announced in 2020 that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, had acquired stakes in Japan's top five trading houses, including Sumitomo. Berkshire Hathaway has raised its stake in each of the five firms to around 9 per cent, it said in its annual report in February. Sumitomo shares jumped more than 7 per cent in trading on Tuesday after markets were closed for a national holiday on Monday. Bloomberg News first reported the investment on Sunday.

    "description": "After inking a revised labor agreement with its pilots, NetJets has signed a deal that could see it spend over $6 billion for up to 232 of Bombardier's Challenger 3500s.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-01T19:15:30Z",
    "content": "After inking a revised labor agreement with its pilots last month, NetJets has signed a deal that could see it spend over $6 billion with options for up to 232 of Bombardier's Challenger 3500s. The unit of Berkshire Hathaway already operates 88 of its predecessor, the Challenger 350. The popular super-midsize private jet features a cabin six feet high with a flat floor. NetJets has signed options for up to 232 super-midsize Bombardier Challenger 3500 private jets.  It is typically offered in an eight-seat configuration and has a nonstop range for coast-to-coast flights. A number of programmatic competitors, including Flexjet, VistaJet, Airshare, and Nicholas Air, feature the aircraft. FlyExclusive recently said it would replace its large cabin Gulfstream fleet with preowned Challenger 350s. Bombardier also confirmed that NetJets was the unnamed customer who placed a firm order for a dozen of the Challengers back in December. That deal carries a retail value of $326 million. Bombardier President and CEO Eric Martel said, \"The Challenger 3500 jet continues to impress with its ultimate combination of refined cabin experience, proven reliability, and top performance, perfectly aligning with the needs of NetJets' discerning client base.\" \"As we evaluate demand and overall growth within the market, we are confident the extension of our super-midsize fleet will continue to differentiate NetJets as the worldwide leader in private aviation,\" according to a spokesperson for the fractional operator. The deal with Bombardier follows similar agreements last year with Textron Aviation and Brazil's Embraer. NetJets' agreement with Textron could see it add 1,500 aircraft valued at around $30 billion over the next 15 years. The Embraer agreement will see it add as many 250 Praetor 500 midsize jets, valued at around $5 billion. In 2022, it was the launch customer for Bombardier’s Global 800. NetJets, Inc., including its aircraft management unit Executive Jet Management, is the largest U.S. private jet charter/fractional flight provider. According to Argus TraqPak, it racked up 609,515 flight hours in 2023, a 1.8% gain. Second-place Flexjet, Inc. flew 204,836 hours last year in North America, while third-ranked Vista Global operators flew 136,511 hours. Charter and fractional flight hours were down 4.6% last year, although they were still 28.7% higher than 2019's pre-Covid numbers. NetJets' growth has been constrained since the pandemic surge, mainly by aircraft in its fleet. In 2021, it was the first major provider to shut down jet card sales as consumers swarmed to private aviation. It stopped renewing existing jet card clients when their hours ran down, and its wait list for fractional customers stretched to more than a year for some of its most popular models, including the Phenom 300, its entry-level jet. Demand was so strong NetJets even stopped offering interim leases covering the flying between when a customer signs to buy their slice of an airplane and when the aircraft is delivered. As industry demand ebbed, NetJets introduced leases starting at 25 hours (instead of the typical 50 hours per year) and brought back its jet cards (which also start at 25 hours), albeit with significantly more restrictions. According to research by Private Jet Card Comparisons, NetJets has the largest pipeline of prospects who didn't buy from it during their last purchasing cycle but are considering it for the future. "

    "content": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — BNSF will become the second major freight railroad to allow some of its employees to report safety concerns anonymously through a federal system without fear of discipline. The Federal Railroad Administration announced Thursday that the railroad owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway had agreed to let its roughly 650 dispatchers participate in the program that all the major railroads promised to join after last year’s disastrous Norfolk Southern derailment in Ohio. “Rail workers deserve to know they’re safe when they’re on the job — and if they experience anything that compromises their safety, they should be able to report it without worrying if their job is in jeopardy,” said Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Buttigieg has been urging the railroads to improve safety ever since the February 2023 derailment. “We hope this program will further empower our employees to provide confidential feedback on critical safety issues in an actionable, timely manner,” BNSF CEO Katie Farmer said. Until NS became the first railroad to sign onto the anonymous reporting system in January, all the major freight railroads resisted joining because they wanted the ability to discipline workers who use the hotline in certain circumstances. The Association of American Railroads trade group has said railroads were worried that the system could be abused by workers who try to avoid discipline by reporting situations a railroad already knows about. But the idea of disciplining workers who report safety concerns undermines the entire purpose of such a hotline because workers won’t use it if they fear retribution, unions and workplace safety experts said. That’s especially important on the railroads where there is a long history of workers being fired for reporting safety violations or injuries. The president of the American Train Dispatchers Association, Ed Dowell, said this move “marks a pivotal moment for rail safety.” “As a program focused on proactive safety measures, it will serve as the new standard for reporting, understanding, and preventing rail incidents,” Dowell said. The Norfolk Southern program is also limited in scope. Only about 1,000 members of the two unions representing engineers and conductors who work in three locations on that railroad can participate. Besides Norfolk Southern and now BNSF, only Amtrak and several dozen small railroads use the government reporting program. The big railroads — that also include Union Pacific, CSX, CPKC and Canadian National — all already have their own internal safety reporting hotlines. But railroad unions have consistently said workers are reluctant to use the railroads’ own safety hotlines because they fear retribution. “Let’s be perfectly clear, railroads remain committed to joining the program and creating an additional trusted avenue for employees to report potential safety concerns,” said Association of American Railroads spokeswoman Jessica Kahanek. FRA Administrator Amit Bose said it’s crucial to have a way for rail workers to use their experience and expertise to raise safety concerns that the railroads can address proactively.

A captivating rental set in Montecito, the celeb-approved seaside California town where Charlie Chaplin opened the landmarked Montecito Inn, now offers access to a fantastical, Gaudí-inspired abode with panoramic ocean and coastline views. \n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tF1's Charles Leclerc Snaps Up a Condo at One of South Florida's Ritziest New Towers\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis Modern L.A. Mansion Has a Separate Guest Apartment in the Backyard\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA Late Guitar Legend's Former Beverly Hills House Can Be Yours for $3 Million\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\tDesigned by architect Frank Robinson and built for a local sailing legend, the mountaintop home was built in 1980 and presides over more than 13 rugged acres. Three bedrooms and four baths are spread out over the 3,412-square-foot main residence that’s been nicknamed “Castle in the Sky,” a clever match given that the sky-high aerie provides majestic vistas over the Pacific Ocean. The pad’s many other eclectic finishes and flourishes, ranging from tiled mosaics to a pool with built-in seating, are other key highlights. Once listed for $1.7 million, the one-of-a-kind home can now be rented for $45,000 a month. Jody Neal of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties holds the unique listing. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tRobinson prioritized sustainability in the design. Adobe brick, known for its insulating properties, was used for the exterior of the home, while a solar system allows it to go “off-grid” for self-sufficient living, according to marketing material. \n\n \n\tThe architect’s creative expression fully unfolds in the interior. The curvy countertops featured in spaces like the kitchen and the primary bedroom, the arched windows, and vibrant ceiling artworks evoke Gaudí’s work, which famously plays with texture and form. Flagstone flooring and exposed adobe brick walls, alongside interestingly adorned vaulted ceilings, allow the interiors to feel like an extension of the natural surroundings.  \n\tThe home’s full character is on display in the light-filled primary bedroom and en-suite bath. The room is designed in a rotunda and features a round, built-in platform bed and a small attached desk area optimally positioned for watching the clouds skate across a picture window. The bathroom features an oversized walk-in shower and a swooping ceiling overhang that echoes a breaking wave. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tA studio apartment for guests or staff, several large fireplaces, and a “secret” tunnel entrance from the two-car garage are other interior standouts. The stone patio outdoors, meanwhile, feels like a continuation of the living space with plenty of room for loungers. A free-from swimming pool encircles the terrace, and a secluded hot tub grotto is well positioned for taking in the view. \n\tThe home’s lively, indiosyncratic design won’t be everyone’s residential cup of tea, but there’s no question the powerful setting forces all to be present and in tune with the Olympian view and natural surroundings. \nClick here for more images of the Montecito home.

    "content": "Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s PacifiCorp now faces a demand for $30 billion from victims of Oregon’s 2020 Labor Day wildfires, an escalation of a legal onslaught on the largest grid operator in the western US. While the amount sought in an amended complaint filed Monday is about two and a half times what the utility is worth, it’s also much bigger than the payout PacifiCorp might be expected to face based on claims resolved so far. The growing liabilities for PacifiCorp prompted Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett to warn in his annual letter to investors that wildfires have turned utilities across the western US into risky investments. Utilities in California, Colorado, Hawaii and Texas have also faced billions in fire liabilities. A jury already found PacifiCorp liable in 2023 for its role in the fires, but victims must undergo separate trials to determine individual damages. The new filing in state court in Portland formally adds the names of 1,000 residents who are covered by a class action case over the destruction of about 2,500 properties in western Oregon. Jurors so far have awarded 36 plaintiffs a total of about $220 million — an average of $6 million per person. That’s far less than the $30 million per person that victim lawyers are seeking in Monday’s filing, which asks for up to $5 million to compensate for actual losses and as much as $25 million for psychological trauma. PacifiCorp, which is appealing last June’s verdict of gross negligence, previously lambasted the amount of damages sought by the plaintiffs. “The idea that any of the numerous plaintiffs with minimal economic damages and no physical injuries are nevertheless entitled to $25 million in noneconomic damages is delusional,” PacifiCorp lawyers wrote in an October court filing. Lawyers for plaintiffs declined to comment on Monday’s filing. Berkshire said in a recent regulatory filing that it faces fire claims in Oregon and California of about $8 billion. That includes demands from state and US government agencies totaling more than $1 billion for various firefighting and cleanup costs. The utility was accused at last year’s trial of failing to heed weather warnings and shut off electricity in its service areas ahead of a wind storm that toppled power lines. “We think a settlement in the mid- to high-single-digit billions is the most likely outcome. Both sides have incentive to settle. Going to trial with all class plaintiffs is risky for PacifiCorp as it’s already lost the first three jury trials, with verdict amounts that point to potential damages in the low- to middle-double-digit billions. Plaintiffs have an incentive as well, because PacifiCorp has viable arguments on appeal to eliminate non-economic damages.” What Bloomberg Intelligence Says “We think a settlement in the mid- to high-single-digit billions is the most likely outcome. Both sides have incentive to settle. Going to trial with all class plaintiffs is risky for PacifiCorp as it’s already lost the first three jury trials, with verdict amounts that point to potential damages in the low- to middle-double-digit billions. Plaintiffs have an incentive as well, because PacifiCorp has viable arguments on appeal to eliminate non-economic damages.” — Elliot Stein, Senior Litigation Analyst PacifiCorp, which has settled some claims over the 2020 fires, has said it’s confident the 2023 liability verdict will be overturned on appeal. But the litigation has spooked investors, hurting the company’s bonds and its credit rating. The company replaced its chief executive officer last summer and is exploring options with Oregon regulators and lawmakers to minimize its wildfire exposure, including recouping its litigation losses from customers and capping damages for non-economic claims.

    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Warren Buffett-backed Mitsui & Co. said it would repurchase as much as 200 billion yen ($1.3 billion) worth of shares after assets sales helped offset weaker annual profits. Most Read from Bloomberg Tesla Axes Supercharger Team in Blow to Broader EV Market Amazon Reports Strong Cloud Unit Sales on Rising AI Demand Pot Stocks Surge on Report DEA Set to Reclassify Marijuana HSBC CEO Quinn Unexpectedly Steps Down After Almost 5 Years Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Gets Four Months in Prison Mitsui plans to buy back as many as 40 million shares between May 2 and Sept. 20, according to a Wednesday statement. The company also announced a 2-for-1 stock split, effective from July, as it aims to lower the cost of its shares to attract smaller investors. The company’s shares closed 1.1% lower in Tokyo trading after earlier rising on the news, trimming an advance this year to 43%. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. holds about 8.3% of the trading house, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales of assets including Indonesian utility PT Paiton Energy, bolstered Mitsui’s ability to deliver shareholder returns, President Kenichi Hori told reporters in a briefing. The Japanese yen has plummeted to the lowest level in three decades against the dollar, due to interest rate differences between Japan and the US and elsewhere. Japanese trading houses, which have sprawling businesses abroad including overseas oil and gas assets, typically benefit from a weaker yen. Why the Yen Is So Weak and What That Means for Japan: QuickTake “A stable exchange rate is better for business management,” Hori said. Mitsui sees an impact of 3.4 billion yen for every 1 yen change against the dollar. Mitsui sees little risk of losses in the current fiscal year from issues with the Arctic LNG 2 energy project in Russia, which was sanctioned by the US last year. The company, which holds a stake through a consortium with Jogmec, is monitoring the situation carefully, according to Hori.

    "published_at": "2024-05-02T22:50:07Z",
    "content": "By Jonathan Stempel and Koh Gui Qing OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - A longtime Berkshire Hathaway director said Greg Abel, who is expected to succeed Warren Buffett as chief executive, may not get the same leeway from the conglomerate's board of directors to make acquisitions. Ronald Olson, a Berkshire director since 1997, said at an investing conference on Thursday that the board would not \"handcuff\" Abel from making acquisitions, in his expected role in allocating Berkshire's capital. But he also said Abel's recent handling of difficult litigation against the billionaire Haslam family over the acquisition of truck stop chain Pilot Travel Centers cemented confidence in his leadership. It was the first time Olson, a lawyer, said he worked closely with Abel. \"There [are] going to be changes in terms of the confidence level that we had in Warren,\" Olson said when asked if Abel would have the same latitude as Buffett to spend cash as he saw fit. \"I don't know how changes will evolve when somebody replaces Warren. Let's not get too anxious about it. He's going to be around for a while. But once that happens, there may well be changes.\" At Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday, Buffett and Abel are likely to get shareholder questions about the conglomerate's future after Abel takes over. Succession at Berkshire has long been on investors' minds as Buffett aged, working at least two decades past when most top executives retire. Those concerns grew after his longtime second-in-command Charlie Munger died in November at age 99. Berkshire acknowledged that Abel was Buffett's successor-in-waiting after Munger let slip at Berkshire's 2021 annual meeting when discussing Berkshire's decentralized, hands-off business model that \"Greg will keep the culture.\" Abel, 61, has since 2018 been a vice chairman overseeing Berkshire's non-insurance businesses including the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, his former home. After Buffett leaves, his son Howard Buffett is expected to become nonexecutive chairman, while others would handle common stock investments. The dispute with the Haslams, including Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, centered on how much Berkshire should pay for the 20% of Pilot it didn't already own. In competing lawsuits, each side accused the other of manipulating Pilot's accounting in bad faith, with the Haslams saying Berkshire was undervaluing its stake, and Berkshire concerned it might overpay. Tensions had been rising earlier, after Berkshire took an 80% stake and replaced top Pilot management. Buffett tasked Abel to sort out the issue, and Olson said \"it was not pleasant going through the litigation.\" But both sides settled in January, and Berkshire paid $2.6 billion for the final 20% of Pilot. \"That was a problem that Warren put in Greg's lap,\" Olson said. \"His preparation and thinking was impressive. He is strategic in his thinking, and he is decisive in his judgment.\"\\ Berkshire also owns several insurers including Geico, the BNSF railroad, a slew of industrial and retail businesses, and hundreds of billions of dollars of stocks including Apple and Bank of America.

    "content": "MarketWatch reporter Venessa Wong explains how inflation jeopardizes the middle class. Plus, colleague Eleanor Laise breaks down the worrisome aspects of taking ketamine for depression without guidance. This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated. Jeremy Owens: Hello and welcome to On Watch by MarketWatch. I'm Jeremy Owens.\nA $100,000 salary no longer buys you a middle class lifestyle. That was the headline on a story last week from senior reporter Venessa Wong, and it sparked a lot of debate among MarketWatch readers. Today, Venessa comes on the show and explains why the inflation shock of recent years put the final stake in the middle class.\nThen we take a critical look at one of the hottest depression treatments in America. After the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry was partly blamed on ketamine, reporter Eleanor Laise dove into the world of ketamine therapy, which is quickly becoming a multi-billion dollar industry. She joins us to warn Americans about the dangers of at-home use of ketamine.\nPlus, we'll take a quick look at the news stories we're watching right now and how they will affect your wallet. First, let's talk about the middle class.\nThe inflation shock has left many middle income families unable to save what they need for the future or accomplish other financial goals that have long been considered anchors of the middle class lifestyle. MarketWatch senior personal finance reporter Venessa Wong reported on that last week and her story attracted more than a hundred comments and counting.\nBut rising inflation was only the final dagger in the back of the middle class. Venessa believes the high cost of three basic economic needs is what actually caused the dramatic effects of inflation, so I invited her on the show to break it down for us.\nWell, Venessa, your story last week sparked a lot of conversation and I wanted to bring that conversation to the podcast. And when I read your story, yeah, there's a lot of numbers in there, but I think there's one line that really brought it home for me and says exactly what you're trying to say here, and that was being middle income no longer affords a middle class quality of life in many parts of the US. Could you kind of explain that contention to me and how you came to that conclusion? Venessa Wong: Yeah, I mean this is such a personal topic for me and a lot of my peers. I think we've recognized that we are statistically doing well. Many of us are statistically falling somewhere in the middle of the income pay range in the US or in our markets, but still not feeling like it's easy or possible to get ahead. And it's a shocking realization that you may be doing okay or even slightly better than okay in many parts of the country right now, but still not be able to do more than cover your basic necessities. Jeremy Owens: And that's not what the middle class lifestyle has always been about. You need to be able to save for the future, you need to be able to enjoy yourself occasionally, but that's not what's happening right now from what you've seen. Venessa Wong: That's right. I mean, middle class typically conveys some sense of financial security and it also conveys some sense of being able to cover more than your needs, to cover some wants.\nThe Washington Post did a survey and that they identified six things that most people consider to be markers of a middle class quality of life, which are having a stable job, being able to save for the future, being able to afford a thousand dollar emergency without debt, being able to pay bills on time without worry, having health insurance and being able to retire comfortably. And doing all of those six things right now on a median income is very difficult. There are surveys that people who make low six figures, if you just kind of like eked past a hundred thousand dollars, it doesn't get you that far anymore.\nA lot of this is due to rising costs for housing, childcare, healthcare. These are big ticket items that eat up a lot of your monthly budget and don't leave very much for discretionary spending, for other necessary spending for that matter. There was a Zillow survey, for example, that showed that the typical family that's looking for a house right now would have to spend 66% of their income on their mortgage and childcare costs at the moment. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, and I want to really get into those three inputs you brought up there, housing, healthcare and childcare.\nNow, a lot of what we're discussing has come up since the big inflation shock of 2021, 2022. I mean, we're still dealing with inflation now. But those three inputs have been getting much more expensive for quite a while now. It was the inflation shock that, all of a sudden, really hit and people felt, but that inflation shock hit so hard to the middle class because the costs of housing, healthcare and childcare had come up so much over decades at that point. Venessa Wong: That's right. I mean, housing is very difficult right now if you're a renter or a buyer. If you're trying to buy a house right now, interest rates are very high. The costs of houses haven't really come down as interests has skyrocketed. Renters obviously continue to be sort of subject to the whims of their landlords, and it's also one of those things that becomes more difficult as you have children and your housing needs sort of expand. Jeremy Owens: And your childcare needs suddenly pop in. Venessa Wong: Correct. Jeremy Owens: When you're already paying a lot for childcare, healthcare, housing, all of a sudden, your grocery bill going up 20%, it's that much harder. And that's definitely what we've seen over the last couple of years.\nAnd just to give some numbers to it, the median income in the US for 2022 is just under $115,000, while you showed some numbers that a family with two adults and two children in large US cities now must spend more than $117,000 annually simply to cover basic needs. Venessa Wong: That's right. And we've seen for many years now, Americans taking on debt to cover basic expenses. There's so many ways to do that. Credit cards, personal loans, people are funding their educations with student loans. Mortgages are really expensive. So I just think like that the shortfall in our incomes is being made up by this growing debt burden, which has become really a very hot political topic, too, because I think we've reached the point where we are recognizing that this is a problem and one that's not sustainable, and we already are starting to see delinquencies rise again.\nAnd this is also in a climate where a lot of costs have continued to rise as well. One of the delinquencies that's up again now are auto delinquencies. The cost of cars have risen spectacularly over the past few years, and we're seeing that the average monthly auto payment is about $700 a month now, which is a lot more than it was before the pandemic. Auto insurance is up as well.\nSo just like the cost to do basic things in America, this isn't anything excessive. It's like where do I live, how do I get to work, how do I buy my food, how do I pay for medical bills have I become very big questions that are insurmountable for a lot of families. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, when I saw that figure, that 117.5K needed for a family of four to live in a large metro area, it actually seemed low to me, living in the San Francisco Bay Area where everything is so expensive, especially housing. Venessa Wong: It is, and it doesn't account for anything that you need for savings. It doesn't count for any unexpected expenses and it doesn't even account, for once, if you want to have a hobby or if you want your children to have a hobby, if you want to do anything besides sort of like daily survival, this estimate doesn't build in any costs for that.\nBut obviously millions of Americans are getting buy on about this much or less in many cases. And what's going on is that they are often compromising things that they need or compromising on things that they want or compromising on saving for the future in order to make all of it work. Jeremy Owens: Well, it would be good to see wages gain along with inflation. We actually have seen wages gain after a long period of stagnation in the last few years. But a lot of those wage gains have been to hourly workers on the lower rung of the salary scale, so that really hasn't helped the middle class that much. Venessa Wong: I think what we're seeing now, though, is that like getting beyond low income into middle income results, obviously, in some quality of life improvement, but not exactly what you would expect, right? And once you're part of this sort of like middle income band, you're still sort of facing a sense of financial precarity that is shocking for the amount of money that you're making.\nThere was a recent survey in which 48% of respondents who earn more than a hundred thousand dollars said they were living paycheck to paycheck, and that includes about a third of those who earn more than $200,000. But when you think about the cost of living in a lot of metro areas, this actually isn't that shocking. I think that people are still expecting that this money will buy them more lifestyle than they're actually getting, and it's because the costs just keep on escalating. And this is something that the Biden administration has talked about a lot in terms of corporate greed and greedflation. Jeremy Owens: Oh, yeah, Venessa, and greedflation is kind of my area because when we talk greedflation, what we're saying is that companies are using inflation to pad their profits. And I've done a lot of deep dives into the profit margins of the S&P 500 over the last three years, especially since we started seeing inflation in '21. Early on, we saw those margins expand for grocery companies and for fast food. And while those companies have upped their wages for the lower rung of the salary band in the past couple of years, they've seen those margins kind of contract again.\nWhere the margins are really fat right now is big tech and they laid off a lot of workers last year and, suddenly, the profits got huge. And the real danger now is that big tech is going to every other sector and telling them, \"Hey, guys, you know you can lay off some middle-income workers to help your profits up.\" And I know there are software salesmen right now in C Suites telling people, \"Hey, you can lay off six figure workers and just hire a couple of $50,000-a-year college grads and buy this AI software and they can do the same job.\"\nAnd that's where we're going to see a lot of real fear and there should be real fear over the next few years for middle class workers. Venessa Wong: There's so many things that are working against the middle band of the workforce, whether it's a focus on corporate profits, whether it's a focus on tech to reduce costs, and I think that's the sense of, emotionally anyway, psychologically precarity that a lot of people are feeling, which was part of what being middle class once symbolized in this country was having a sense of stability, having a sense of stable employment, which enables you to do all of those things, save for the future and afford an emergency and retire one day. And all of those things are just slowly being eroded. Jeremy Owens: And I don't see anything that's going to change that coming up. I mean, I feel like this is something we're going to have to continue talking about because it is the thing that everybody's going to get frustrated about. If you do everything right in your 20s and early 30s and you get to that point in your career where you're making six figures and you feel like you should be actually enjoying yourself after working so hard to get there, well, it's not what it was supposed to be. It's not what it's been in the past. Venessa Wong: That's right. There's been a lot of emphasis recently on positive economic metrics and how real incomes are up. So even though there's been record inflation, incomes have sort of made up for that in some way and we should be back to our pre-pandemic vibe because of that.\nTo which I would say two things. Vibes weren't great before the pandemic. I think there were a lot of cost-of-living pressures for middle-income people before we faced a global health crisis. And also I think we should always be evaluating who is enjoying economic growth. Because if there's anything that we've come out of the pandemic knowing and trying to keep in mind is that those gains are not evenly distributed. And so even while we're seeing low-income workers come away from this recovery with bigger gains in wages, we also saw them suffer the greatest losses at the beginning of the pandemic.\nI personally think it's politically dangerous to ignore these qualitative points of feedback that might be obscured by macroeconomic data. Jeremy Owens: Venessa, I do really appreciate the conversation. I appreciate that your story sparked this conversation. If you have not read the story, please go do so. And if you want to talk more about this, please hit us up at On Watch at marketwatch.com. You can reach out to Venessa independently as well to give her your story.\nThanks so much for joining us, Venessa. Venessa Wong: Thank you so much for having me. Jeremy Owens: We're going to take a quick break. Coming up, ketamine therapy. Stay with us.\nWelcome back to On Watch by MarketWatch. Before the break, we talked with Venessa Wong about her article on the middle class. Now we welcome MarketWatch healthcare reporter, Eleanor Laise to talk about a very important investigative story she recently published.\nKetamine is a powerful tranquilizer that has also been used as a recreational drug, but in recent years it has turned into something much different, a treatment for depression. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has admitted using the drug, saying it is helpful for getting one out of a negative frame of mind.\nBut ketamine was also a factor in the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry. And when Eleanor dug in, she found many other troubling anecdotes about the drug's usage. So we asked her to join us this week and talk about the multi-billion dollar industry and how to avoid the worst parts of it.\nWell, Eleanor, I've always known ketamine as a very powerful tranquilizer and a sometimes party drug named Special K. But how did it become like a trendy depression treatment? Eleanor Laise: That's right. This can be a really confusing area for patients right now because, like you say, ketamine is many things all at once. It's an FDA-approved anesthetic, which has been around for more than 50 years. It's a controlled substance that can have hallucinogenic effects and, as such, it's a party drug. But it's also increasingly popular as a mental health treatment even though it has not been approved by the FDA for that purpose. Jeremy Owens: Right. There is one nasal spray that's been approved by the FDA, esketamine, which is marketed by Johnson & Johnson as a nasal spray called Spravato, and that's a ketamine-derived drug that was approved in 2019.\nBut ketamine itself has not been approved for psychiatric use and that's really what people need to know is that no regulator has said, \"Yes, ketamine is good for depression and people should be using it.\" Eleanor Laise: Right. No, the FDA has certainly not said that about ketamine itself.\nWhat happened really was in recent decades there was research studying lower doses of ketamine, the sub-anesthetic doses, not the level that might knock you out before a major surgery, finding that those sub-anesthetic doses looked promising as a potential mental health treatment. So doctors started prescribing it for this off-label use, even though ketamine has not actually been approved for treatment of any psychiatric disorders.\nKetamine therapy has become quite a big business. I mean, over the past decade it has grown from virtually nothing to, by some estimates, roughly 1200 to 1500 ketamine clinics nationwide. The ketamine clinic market is valued at about 3.4 billion. Some ketamine therapy providers will offer in-person only treatments. In many cases, that means you're getting the ketamine through an IV with in-person preparation and aftercare from a clinician. Jeremy Owens: And that lines up with what I've heard about psychedelic treatment just in general, right? This is something that you want to do with somebody in a controlled environment. Eleanor Laise: Right, but we also have many providers that are offering online ketamine therapy where it's done more remotely. And the pandemic really helped spur the growth of the online therapy providers because the regulations on telehealth prescribing of controlled substances were relaxed during the COVID lockdowns. Jeremy Owens: But it's the at-home where you found a lot of people who had really bad experiences through telehealth and at-home administration of this drug, right? Eleanor Laise: Yeah, I mean there are some overarching concerns about whether we really have enough data on ketamine to arrive at firm conclusions, but particular concerns are being raised about at-home therapy for a number of reasons.\nA number of the experts I spoke with and the FDA itself have expressed a lot of discomfort with at-home ketamine use, first of all, the lack of in-person monitoring. Ketamine can cause changes in your blood pressure and heart rate. It causes, of course, sedation and dissociation. Over time, ketamine misuse can cause bladder damage.\nAnd getting back to this question of dosage, when you get treatments in a clinic, often those are the IV ketamine infusions and the dosing there can be a little bit more straightforward. At-home therapy in many cases involves ketamine lozenges or troches that dissolve slowly in your mouth. And the FDA has said that there's variation in the dosages of these oral compounded ketamine products that are marketed by telehealth platforms, making it hard to predict what risks might be associated with those treatments. Jeremy Owens: I think the most depressing anecdote you have in your story is about somebody who was going through the at-home in that way with the dissolvable ketamine lozenge, and was supposed to spit out what was left. And the person in the at-home therapy told them to swallow it, and they ended up with toxicity in their blood from too much ketamine, right? Eleanor Laise: Right. That person arrived at the emergency room unresponsive and was found to have a concentration of ketamine in her blood that was double the level typically used for general anesthesia. So there's definitely the potential for mistakes to be made, either by the patient or the provider.\nActually, one survey last year found that more than half of people who had tried at-home ketamine therapy had either accidentally or intentionally taken more than the recommended dose. Of course, mistakes can happen anywhere, but if you're in a clinical setting, at least there are providers on hand to help you.\nOne concern I've heard from some in the industry is that some prospective patients seem to be sort of price-shopping for ketamine, looking for the cheapest product they can find, but experts say that's really not a good idea.\nThere are a lot of other points to consider if you're really looking at this as a potential mental health treatment. Is this a provider who's going to give you ketamine no matter what, or is there a screening process and a thorough medical and psychiatric evaluation, determine whether ketamine is actually an appropriate treatment for you? Is this a very transactional process or is there going to be some sort of ongoing relationship between you and the practitioner? Are they going to follow up with you and discuss any side effects you experienced and whether it makes sense to continue the treatment?\nA large professional group of ketamine practitioners that's coming up with some new guidelines on ketamine therapy says they're not going to be recommending online-only business models that don't include that sort of ongoing relationship. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, and you spoke with somebody who had developed an at-home ketamine therapy startup business, and he had actually gotten out of the business and was very concerned about where it was headed, right? Eleanor Laise: Right. So he co-founded a mental health company that offered at-home ketamine therapy a few years ago, but he grew very uncomfortable for a few different reasons.\nHe sensed pressure from prospective investors to sort of maximize the profitability of patients. He felt there was sort a push toward longer term ketamine therapy, sort of regardless of whether that was the best thing for the patient. And again, the price shopping that he saw among some of the patients seemed to him, like he said, sort of a race to the bottom. Jeremy Owens: So just to break this down and make it as simple as possible for people, ketamine has not been approved for use for depression and the at-home ketamine therapy business has some issues right now that could make it dangerous for those who take part in it. Eleanor Laise: Right, and that's a very sharp contrast with the rules that the FDA has established for Spravato. The FDA has said you cannot take Spravato at home. It has to be done in a healthcare setting. Patients have to stay for at least two hours after each dose to be monitored for any adverse effects. So it's two very different worlds that exist here. Jeremy Owens: Right, right. Exactly. And I think, well, there might be even three, Eleanor, because you've got the nasal spray and then you've got the IV treatment that is very similar where you need to be in the clinic. And I think that's the one that first sprung up and you saw ketamine clinics all over the place.\nAnd then the pandemic allowed this to be done through telehealth, sent to people's homes, even though it's not FDA-approved. Are those rules in place forever? Is there anything that could push back against the telehealth ketamine industry? Eleanor Laise: So those more flexible rules that existed during the pandemic are still in place for right now. Officially, they are supposed to expire at the end of this year, but there are signs that it's quite likely they could be with us in some form for the longer term. Jeremy Owens: And that's because they're very useful for other drugs. A lot of ill people who find it troublesome to go out of the house, their lives have been made easier because of these rules. But not for ketamine, just in general. Eleanor Laise: Right. Nobody wants to really cut off access for someone who really needs a treatment. So the DEA has already said it's committed to the expansion of telemedicine and it's working on some new rules around this so stay tuned. We'll definitely be watching how that plays out. Jeremy Owens: For sure. And if somebody is considering using ketamine to treat their depression, their PTSD, whatever they may be facing, what would your suggestion to them be? Eleanor Laise: You're likely going to confront this choice between in-person therapy in a clinic and at-home therapy, and you want to consider all these risks that we've discussed in terms of how ketamine can impact your blood pressure, your heart rate, all those factors.\nAnd I would weigh the FDA's warnings about the compounded oral ketamine products and the variation in dosage and the unpredictability of potential side effects there. Some doctors say the doses available from some of these online providers are alarmingly high, higher than what they themselves would offer a patient through an IV when they're monitoring them in-person in a clinic. But we want to acknowledge that affordability and accessibility are important issues. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, it could cost thousands of dollars per session, right? Nothing about ketamine is usually covered by healthcare because it is not FDA-approved. Maybe Spravato is the one thing that you could possibly see getting covered by some form of healthcare. Eleanor Laise: There's some spotty coverage even of ketamine therapy itself, but the odds are a lot of patients are going to be paying out of pocket. So you want to evaluate, of course, not just the price, but all the services that come with it, the group therapy, the education, the follow-up consultations. So I would weigh all of that. Jeremy Owens: This is a situation where you do not want to hunt for the best price. You want to make sure that you're being treated in the way that you need to be treated to get better. Eleanor Laise: Right. It may seem tempting, but I would really weigh all the other services that are going to wrap around that part of your mental health treatment. Jeremy Owens: Well, Eleanor, thank you so much for coming on here and bringing this important story to us. Please read Eleanor's story to get more and thank you so much, Eleanor. We'll have you on again. Eleanor Laise: Thank you. Jeremy Owens: Before we go, it's time for What We Are Watching, a look at the news you need to know for the rest of the week and beyond.\nStarbucks and McDonald's executives said this week that customers are beginning to scrutinize their discretionary purchases more closely this year. That could be troubling news for the economy, which has been supported in recent years by surprisingly strong consumer spending. With two of the most widespread US chains reporting a pullback in the first three months of the year, fears are growing about the effects of years-long inflation on Americans' wallets and spending habits.\nBerkshire Hathaway will hold its annual meeting on Saturday, an event that has become quite the party for Warren Buffett and his company. But this year's event may be more somber as it will be the first since the death of Buffett's longtime compatriot, Charlie Munger. Still, Buffett's annual letter outlining his thoughts on the current state of investing and the economy, which he has issued for nearly 60 years in a row now, will make news this weekend.\nThe Monthly Jobs Report will be released tomorrow. And if you couldn't tell from our discussion about wages and layoffs, it will be crucial to understanding the current state of the US economy. After the federal government reported recently that gross domestic product declined in the first quarter while inflation began growing again, there are concerns about stagflation floating around, which this report could dispute or bolster. We'll talk more about that next week.\nAnd that's it for this episode. Thanks to Venessa Wong and Eleanor Laise. You can subscribe to the show wherever you get your podcasts and please do. If you like what you heard, please leave us a rating or review. It really helps others discover the show. And let us know what you want to hear from us.

    "title": "Campus calls to divest from Israel hinge on a tough question: Where’s the money exactly?",
    "description": "Pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University demanded the school drop any investments in companies doing business in Israel.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-02T21:24:58Z",
    "content": "Pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University yelled “disclose, divest, we will not stop” as they broke into Hamilton Hall earlier this week, demanding the school drop any investments in companies doing business in Israel. But shedding those stakes first requires identifying them, and even that step — disclosure — can get tricky fast, higher education finance experts say. Many large university endowments are murkily set up with thousands of individual funds that have their own rules on how they’re invested, few requirements to share their investments publicly, and third-party managers whose oversight of day-to-day trading can limit campus officials’ knowledge of their own schools’ portfolios. “I think a lot of people believe an endowment is a piggy bank, and it’s not,” said Bill Guerrero, chief financial officer at the University of Bridgeport, a private university in Connecticut. School endowments are typically composed of many smaller funds, each with their own purposes, said Scott Malpass, who served for over three decades as the chief investment officer at the University of Notre Dame, a private Catholic institution outside of South Bend, Indiana, with nearly 9,000 students. During his tenure, which concluded with his 2020 retirement, the market value of the school’s endowment pool — a collection of several thousand distinct funds — grew from over $450 million in 1988 to more than $13.8 billion by the end of fiscal year 2019. “The big endowments have tried to improve on that in the last 20 to 30 years,” Malpass said of investment transparency, suggesting there may be room in some cases to go further. The University of Bridgeport, with nearly $42 million in assets and fewer than 2,000 students, has individual fund agreements numbering in the hundreds, said Guerrero, in which donors can specify how they’d like their contributions invested. A given fund might, for example, be earmarked solely for environmentally friendly investments. What’s more, many of these agreed-upon rules of investment are confidential, Guerrero said: “It’s very, very restrictive.” Student demonstrators have seized on this opacity as part of their broader divestment push. “It has been impossible to get Columbia to fully disclose their entire investment portfolio despite efforts from not just student organizers, but concerned faculty,” the Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine said in an Instagram post last week. “They have refused transparency for far too long.” The university has rejected calls to divest from Israel and instead offered to “publish a process for students to access a list of Columbia’s direct investment holdings, and to increase the frequency of updates to that list of holdings.” But direct investments rarely reflect the full scope of an institution’s portfolio. Many resemble a series of matryoshka dolls, in which some component funds that may not directly hold certain Israeli stocks could still have indirect ties to the country, for instance through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that themselves may have exposure to Israel. What’s more, universities tend to be mum about which asset management firms they hire to handle their investments — both direct and indirect ones. The Knight Foundation reached out to 50 U.S. colleges with some of the largest endowments last year, asking them to share details about the share of their funds managed by firms with diverse leadership. Only 18 participated fully, and eight others opted to self-report more limited data. “Even as public-facing institutions, universities historically are not transparent about their financial affairs,” the researchers concluded. “There’s no incentive” for institutions to share more details about their investments, Malpass acknowledged. Many institutions worry that publicizing too much information could allow others to copy their investment strategies or scare away asset managers that prefer keeping their client lists private. By law, nonprofits like university endowments are required to report some information annually on the Internal Revenue Service’s Form 990. The document outlines the broad mix of assets (i.e., stocks versus bonds) that an endowment has invested in, but it doesn’t require granular detail on specific companies or industries those investments are focused on. Many school endowment officers also publish their own annual reports to help students, faculty, alumni and donors understand how money has flown in and out of their portfolios over a given year. But these reports are optional, leaving it mostly up to university administrators to decide how much additional information to publicize. Institutions with assets exceeding $100 million are also required to report holdings every three months through 13F filings, which are mandated by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. But those snapshots aren’t comprehensive; for example, Columbia University’s endowment reported $13.6 billion in assets in June of last year, but 13F filings detailed only $68 million of those holdings, which include stakes in various therapeutics companies as well as Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. With just 0.5% of the portfolio covered by 13F filings, the remaining 99.5% is outlined only in much broader strokes on the school’s Form 990. In a statement to NBC News, Columbia University spokesperson Robert Hornsby said “we don’t share direct holdings beyond what is filed publicly, and nor do we disclose investment manager information.” The complexity of endowment funds hasn’t stopped universities from making divestments in the past. Three years ago, several large schools agreed to reduce ties with the fossil fuel industry following students’ climate change protests. An investment policy guiding Columbia’s endowment now lists fossil fuels, thermal coal, private prison operators and tobacco as restricted industries. Malpass, who restricted some exposure to drillers and oil exploration companies during his time at Notre Dame, said divesting stock holdings “isn’t challenging at all.” Many could be sold in a day, he said, though private investments could take longer to exit. Some argue that even a widespread divestment push across American higher education, which seems unlikely, would have little impact on the war in Gaza. “Corporate decisions are going to make a much bigger statement than divestment from a university endowment ever would,” said Chris Marsicano, the director of the College Crisis Initiative at Davidson College, a small liberal arts school in North Carolina. Others have warned that selling shares of Israeli firms at a cheap price could benefit investors who support the country, noting that boycotts of goods tend to exert greater pressure than boycotts of stocks. There’s also the risk that pro-Palestinian divestment efforts could trigger an exodus of deep-pocketed university donors with countervailing sympathies. Even so, Marsicano noted that pro-Palestinian campus protests are getting the attention of the Israeli government, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denouncing them in an address last week. “Divestment is definitely the vehicle to keep the protests going,” he said, “rather than the financial implications of divestment.” This article was originally published on NBCNews.com Sign in to create a watchlist"

Three years ago, several large schools agreed to reduce ties with the fossil fuel industry following students’ climate change protests. An investment policy guiding Columbia’s endowment now lists fossil fuels, thermal coal, private prison operators and tobacco as restricted industries. Malpass, who restricted some exposure to drillers and oil exploration companies during his time at Notre Dame, said divesting stock holdings “isn’t challenging at all.” Many could be sold in a day, he said, though private investments could take longer to exit. Some argue that even a widespread divestment push across American higher education, which seems unlikely, would have little impact on the war in Gaza. “Corporate decisions are going to make a much bigger statement than divestment from a university endowment ever would,” said Chris Marsicano, the director of the College Crisis Initiative at Davidson College, a small liberal arts school in North Carolina. Others have warned that selling shares of Israeli firms at a cheap price could benefit investors who support the country, noting that boycotts of goods tend to exert greater pressure than boycotts of stocks. There’s also the risk that pro-Palestinian divestment efforts could trigger an exodus of deep-pocketed university donors with countervailing sympathies. Even so, Marsicano noted that pro-Palestinian campus protests are getting the attention of the Israeli government, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denouncing them in an address last week. “Divestment is definitely the vehicle to keep the protests going,” he said, “rather than the financial implications of divestment.” Brian Cheung is a business and data correspondent for NBC News. © 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL"

Embora Buffett não estará sozinho no palco, é provável que os diálogos não sejam tão sarcásticos ou acalorados. Greg Abel, que é responsável pelas operações não relacionadas a seguros da Berkshire e considerado o provável sucessor de Buffett na posição de CEO, deverá se juntar a Buffett neste final de semana, ao lado de Ajit Jain, encarregado do negócio de seguros. Leia mais: InfoMoney vai a Omaha para conferência da Berkshire Hathaway, de BuffettA assembleia anual de acionistas da Berkshire Hathaway já foi denominada de “Woodstock para Capitalistas”.

Mas, tradicionalmente, a maioria queria ouvir o que Buffett e Munger tinham a dizer sobre investimentos e o clima atual. “Charlie e eu somos sem vergonha”, escreveu Buffett em sua carta aos acionistas no ano passado. “Ano passado, em nossa primeira reunião de acionistas em três anos, recebemos vocês com nossa habitual agitação comercial. Logo do início, fomos diretamente à sua carteira. Em pouco tempo, nosso quiosque da See’s vendeu onze toneladas de nutritivos pés-de-moleque e chocolates. Em nosso discurso, mais parecido com uma fala de P.T. Barnum, prometemos longevidade. Afinal, além dos doces da See’s, o que mais poderia explicar o fato de Charlie e eu termos chegado aos 99 e 92 anos?Munger faleceu dias antes de completar 100 anos de idade. Ele e Buffett se conheceram quando ambos trabalhavam em uma mercearia do avô de Buffett enquanto ainda adolescentes, mas só vieram a perceber isso em 1959. Entretanto, foi só em 1978, quando Munger assumiu o cargo de vice-presidente da Berkshire Hathaway, que os dois começaram a fazer magia.“O projeto que ele me deu era simples: Esqueça o que você sabe sobre comprar negócios justos a preços maravilhosos; em vez disso, compre negócios maravilhosos a preços justos”, escreveu Buffett na carta aos acionistas da empresa em 2015.  “Mudar meu comportamento não é tarefa fácil (pergunte à minha família). Eu já havia alcançado sucesso razoável sem a contribuição de Charlie, então por que deveria dar ouvidos a um advogado que nunca passou um dia sequer na escola de administração (sendo que, bem, eu compareci a três). Mas Charlie nunca se cansou de repetir suas máximas sobre negócios e investimentos para mim, e sua lógica era irrefutável. Assim sendo, a Berkshire foi construída com base no modelo de Charlie.”Na carta aos acionistas de fevereiro, Buffett prestou homenagem ao seu sócio: “Charlie nunca quis crédito por seu papel como criador; em vez disso, deixou-me fazer as reverências e receber os elogios. De certa forma, seu relacionamento comigo era em parte um de irmão mais velho, em parte um de pai amoroso. …Embora eu esteja há muito tempo no comando da equipe de construção, Charlie deveria sempre receber o crédito de ser o arquiteto.” Continua depois da publicidade NYT: ©.2024 The New York Times Company \n                                        \"Oráculo de Omaha\" enfatizou que futuro CEO da Berkshire não vai dividir responsabilidades sobre onde alocar os recursos                                     \n                                        Sem Munger, megainvestidor terá uma equipe diferente interagindo com o público durante o evento deste sábado (4)                                    "

    "content": "Keeping Current Matters CEO David Childers and Jimmy Burgess discuss why a relevant market opinion based on facts, not fears, is key for educating consumers and navigating industry changes. Inman Connect  May is Commission and Compensation Month here at Inman. We’ll sort through the noise and misinformation and provide you with the most up-to-date facts and strategies about how to prosper in the wake of the commission settlements. And look for straight-to-your inbox updates with Inman’s new weekly digest, Commission Chronicles. Success begins with an understanding of what is happening and a belief that you can provide clients with the information they need to make the best decision possible for themselves. David Childers, CEO of Keeping Current Matters, is here to share action steps and talking points to recalibrate you to a mindset for success. Childers began by saying, “Mindset is probably the biggest battle agents are facing right now [with] everything that has come out from the [National Association of Realtors] settlement and the questions about how things will look when the anticipated changes go into effect. “This leads to the question, who are you listening to? Are you listening to the media, to the people who are fearful, or are you focusing on the facts? Because when you start to look at the facts, they tell a different story than what is often being told. Who you listen to sets the mindset you have and the actions you take, so be careful who you are listening to.” Childers shared that the first step in creating a mindset for success is to develop a relevant market opinion based on the facts. Childers said, “The questions will come. ‘Are prices going down? What do you think about mortgage rates? What do you think is going to happen over the next six months?'” You will answer these questions in one of two ways. The first is “I don’t know,” or “We will have to wait and see.” The second is, “Can I share with you a few things I’ve found, and what I believe will happen?” When you have this relevant market opinion based on facts, it is no longer your opinion versus their opinion. It’s their opinion versus the facts. He suggested agents utilize data to provide prospects with the best information possible. He broke the frequently asked questions into three categories, including pricing, number of transactions and interest rates. Childers said all agents should be aware of current pricing trends. “Although prices on the local level can vary from national averages, the seven forecasters we follow at Keeping Current Matters have an expectation this year for an average appreciation nationally of about 2.5 percent. But these forecasts range from flat to 5 percent appreciation. Agents need to understand both the national and local numbers when it comes to pricing. Forming an opinion based on the local pricing trends is critical to success for agents, but when a prospective buyer or seller turns on the TV at night, they are educated at the national level.  So here is what you want to say: “You may have heard this about home prices on the national level, but let me share with you what we are seeing at the local level as well.” At that point, share this slide on the national numbers along with your printed data on the local level.  The ability to show how steady price appreciation can build equity is another way agents can be educators and provide a professional perspective for buyers. This chart shows the estimated home price performance over the next five years from Fannie Mae’s Home Price Expectations Survey.  Although showing these percentages can be helpful, visually showing what those projections could mean in terms of home equity can be even more valuable. This next slide shows the potential growth in equity over the next five years based on the purchase of a $400,000 home in January 2024 and the price appreciation projected by the Home Price Expectations Survey.  An agent’s ability to have a relevant opinion on pricing that is based on facts is exactly what prospective buyers need in today’s environment,” Childers said. The next area we discussed was the number of home sales forecast for 2024. Childers said, “The forecasts range from an estimated 4.9 million homes to be sold in 2024 to 5.4 million homes to be sold as the chart shows. This year will be a year filled with transactions; the question is how much of the market share are you going to grab?”  When asked about mortgage rates and their effect on the number of transactions, Childers said, “The current market is a demand-based rate environment. We believe 6.5 percent is sort of the dividing line between limited to weak demand and good to strong demand.  Most consumers realize it’s extremely unlikely that we would see what we saw two years ago with 3 percent rates on 30-year mortgages, so there are a couple of things we look at to evaluate what the future holds.  We watch what economists are saying regarding the 10-year Treasury note rates and what the Fed is saying about the timing of anticipated cuts to the Fed Funds Rate. Based on what economists are saying, we anticipate a better rate environment in the second half of the year. Most of the projections show improvement with an expectation of rates being in the 6 percent range by the end of the year, probably in the 6.5 percent range.  Based on sharing this information with prospective buyers, they will often say, “Great, then we will just wait for the rates to come down.” But that is what everyone else is saying as well. This could lead to increased pricing and an increase in the competition to buy the homes that are for sale at that time.  “Based on this, it might be wise for buyers to buy that home now instead of waiting for an anticipated drop in rates and increased competition for a limited number of homes for sale.”  “In our world, everything has changed, and nothing has changed. Things have changed regarding the NAR settlement and things that impact the way we do our business. But nothing has changed relative to our need to be an educator. Nothing has changed relative to our need to be out in the market with a relevant market opinion based on facts. If anything, the value of being an educator has risen over the past several months and in the last year. So, our job is to be active in our local markets and to share the facts versus what someone’s opinion might be,” Childers said. “When a question comes up about the market our ability to share exactly what’s happening will be the difference maker. This is a time when people want to know: Do you know what is happening, and can you give them good advice? This takes the pressure off us as well because we don’t have to convince them to do anything. We simply provide them with the best information possible so they can make the best decision possible for themselves and their family.” Jimmy Burgess is the CEO for Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Beach Properties of Florida in Northwest Florida.

    "content": "No Swan So Fine / Wikimedia Commons The class action lawsuit filed by plaintiff James Lutz alleges that HomeServices and other members of the National Association of Realtors fixed commissions, which misled buyers and resulted in buyers paying inflated home prices. Inman Connect  May is Commission and Compensation Month here at Inman. We’ll sort through the noise and misinformation and provide you with the most up-to-date facts and strategies about how to prosper in the wake of the commission settlements. And look for straight-to-your inbox updates with Inman’s new weekly digest, Commission Chronicles. In a departure from most commission lawsuits filed in recent months by homesellers, a new class action lawsuit was filed on Monday in Florida against HomeServices of America by homebuyers who allege that HomeServices and other members of the National Association of Realtors fixed commissions, which misled buyers and resulted in buyers paying inflated home prices. A similar case known as Batton 1 was filed against the firm in Illinois in February by homebuyers, but HomeServices was dismissed from the case because none of the company’s constituents are Illinois-based and plaintiffs did not submit a claim that would assert nationwide authority in the case. The lawsuit filed on Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida names James Lutz as the plaintiff who bought a home in Key Colony, Florida, in 2021 using a buyer agent who is affiliated with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, one of HomeServices of America’s franchisees. The lawsuit is seeking class-action status that will include buyers nationwide who bought MLS-listed homes starting on December 1, 1996. “For decades, homebuyers across America have been unwittingly paying too much for, and receiving too little from, services offered to them by Defendants and other real estate agent members of National Association of Realtors (‘NAR’),” the complaint states. “Despite agent representations (which NAR permits and encourages) that such services do not cost homebuyers anything, homebuyers in fact pay a hefty cost for these services — namely, supracompetitive commissions at levels fixed by the Defendants, NAR; and other real estate brokers, which in turn lead to higher home prices paid by buyers.” The suit goes on to allege that the cost to consumers, as a result of the so-called fixed prices, was “enormous,” claiming that “experts have suggested that the amount of ‘annual broker fees consumers might save if there was effective price competition is as much as $30 billion or more annually.'” Chris Kelly (Credit: Ebby Halliday) Meanwhile, HomeServices has denied any wrongdoing or anticompetitive behavior and argued that the alleged damages contradicts those asserted in and accepted by the jury in the Burnett case, Real Estate News reported. “While we are just beginning to analyze this buyer antitrust case that was filed immediately on the heels of our settlement of the Burnett action, we maintain our position that HomeServices’ conduct and business practices were at all times lawful and procompetitive,” HomeServices of America Executive Vice President Chris Kelly told Real Estate News. “We also note that Plaintiffs’ theory of damages in this follow-on lawsuit is directly at odds with the damages theory accepted by the jury in the Burnett case and could potentially result in a duplicative recovery that would be unfair, unjust and violative of HomeServices’ rights,” Kelly added. NAR’s “Free Service Rule,” which in the past, had allowed buyers’ agents to represent their services as free of cost, and which the lawsuit also takes issue with, was eliminated in 2022. NAR’s policy change at that time stated, “MLS participants and subscribers must not represent their brokerage services to a client or customer are free or available at no cost to clients, unless the participant or subscriber will receive no financial compensation from any source for those services.” Email Lillian Dickerson Simply enter the email address you used to create your account and click \"Reset Password\".

The expansion observed in the historical period can be attributed to factors such as demographic changes, economic stability, increased risk perception among individuals, and product innovation in the insurance market.The market is expected to see further steady growth, reaching $11246.74 billion in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.7%. The anticipated growth in the forecast period can be attributed to global economic trends, concerns related to climate change, regulatory changes affecting the insurance landscape, emerging risks in various sectors, and infrastructure development. Key trends expected in the forecast period include the integration of sustainable and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations, growth in parametric insurance, applications of blockchain technology in the insurance industry, and the use of remote risk assessment tools.The anticipated increase in insurance penetration is poised to propel the growth of the life and non-life insurance market in the coming years. Insurance penetration denotes the extent of insurance coverage, representing the percentage of the population or businesses with insurance policies in relation to the total insurable market or population. This surge in insurance penetration holds significant advantages for both life and non-life insurance sectors, fostering heightened financial protection, risk mitigation, and overall market stability. These benefits accrue to individuals, businesses, and the broader economy. Notably, in 2021, according to data from the Insurance Information Institute, life insurance premiums in the US witnessed an 11.5% increase, reaching $159.5 billion. Additionally, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development reported an 11.2% rise in insurance penetration in Sweden in 2021. Consequently, the upward trend in insurance penetration is expected to drive growth in the life and non-life insurance market.The growth of the life and non-life insurance market is set to receive a boost from the increasing global population. The global population encompasses the total number of people inhabiting the Earth at a specific point in time, spanning individuals from all countries, regions, and continents. The expanding global population not only diversifies the market for insurance products but also presents insurers with opportunities to tailor offerings to meet the evolving needs of a dynamic and growing population. In July 2022, a report by the United Nations projected the global population to reach approximately 8.5 billion by 2030, with a further increase to 9.7 billion by 2050. Subsequently, a peak population of around 10.4 billion individuals is anticipated during the 2080s. Thus, the rising global population is a key driver behind the growth of the life and non-life insurance market.Technological advancements emerge as a prominent trend gaining traction in the life and non-life insurance market. Major companies operating in this market are actively developing new technological solutions to bolster their positions. For example, in March 2023, Sure Insurance LLC, a US-based digital insurance provider, introduced Retrace - an e-commerce solution. This innovative technology enables online retailers to seamlessly offer clients integrated one-click insurance and protection. Featuring a set of APIs (application programming interfaces), Retrace facilitates the integration of security and insurance for various use cases, including the groundbreaking Retrace Return Shipping Protection, which enhances the online purchasing experience for both consumers and retailers.Major companies in the life and non-life insurance market are at the forefront of developing innovative products, such as indexed variable universal life (Indexed VUL) insurance, to cater to larger customer bases, drive sales, and increase revenue. Indexed VUL insurance combines features from both variable universal life (VUL) insurance and indexed universal life (IUL) insurance.The report covers market characteristics, size and growth, segmentation, regional and country breakdowns, competitive landscape, market shares, trends and strategies for this market.

    "description": "The first Saturday of May marks two significant events: the Kentucky Derby and the annual meeting for Berkshire Hathaway.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-02T12:00:00Z",
    "content": "LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY - MAY 07:  Jockey Sonny Leon aboard Rich Strike celebrates after Rich Strike ... [+] won the 148th running at Churchill Downs on May 07, 2022 in Louisville, Kentucky. (Photo by Andy Lyons/Getty Images) The first Saturday of May marks two significant events: the Kentucky Derby and the annual meeting for Berkshire Hathaway. Despite their apparent differences, these events share striking similarities. Both attract massive, passionate crowds and are steeped in tradition. Moreover, they offer participants the potential to turn a profit, whether through winning bets or from successful investments. The age-old question for investors and horse racing enthusiasts alike is: do you pick the horse or the jockey? As Warren Buffett famously quipped, when a CEO with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with poor economics, the reputation of the business remains intact. The same applies to jockeys and horses. Legendary jockey Willie Shoemaker riding a show pony would never have won a race. Similarly, one of Buffett's all-time favorite CEOs, Tom Murphy, who ran Capital Cities/ABC (which later merged with Disney), would likely have struggled in a declining industry like buggy whips. However, when you combine a great CEO with a good business or a great jockey with a high-quality horse, magic happens – winning races for horse racing fans and great returns for shareholders. This year's Kentucky Derby features legendary jockey John Velazquez riding the odds-on favorite, Fierceness. Velazquez has won the Kentucky Derby three times before: in 2011 with Animal Kingdom, in 2017 with Always Dreaming, and in 2020 with Authentic. A win this year would tie him with Willie Shoemaker for the third-most wins, behind only Eddie Arcaro and Bill Hartack, who each have five victories. The role of a skilled jockey on a high-performing horse is analogous to that of a great CEO leading a successful company. Just as a talented jockey can guide a horse to victory, a competent CEO can steer a company towards success. Both must make critical decisions under pressure, adapt to changing circumstances, and optimize their assets to achieve the best possible outcome. Buffett has a stable of great CEOs who run businesses that Berkshire Hathaway owns completely or has minority positions in. Some are well-known, like James Quincey, who leads Coca-Cola\nCoca-Cola\n, or Todd Combs, CEO of GEICO. Others, like Pat Egan, who runs See's Candies, may be less famous but are equally talented. Horse racing involves substantial strategy and competition, with jockeys making split-second decisions and trainers meticulously preparing horses for each race. The ability to quickly recover from mistakes is also crucial. Buffett now readily admits that buying a faltering textile operation named Berkshire Hathaway was a poor decision. However, his longtime partner, Charlie Munger (who passed away in December at age 99), advised him on how to fix the mistake. The key, Munger said, was to \"give up buying fair businesses at wonderful prices\" and instead add \"wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices\" to Berkshire's portfolio. This year's Kentucky Derby features two first-time jockeys: Keith Asmussen, riding Just Steel, and Ryusei Sakai, riding Forever Young. Asmussen, the 25-year-old son of Hall of Fame trainer Steve Asmussen, will participate in his first Derby after less than two years of full-time riding. Sakai, a rising star in Japan, may bring good karma to the race, given Berkshire's success in Japan in recent years. While Warren Buffett won't be at Churchill Downs on Saturday, he will have his two favorite \"jockeys\" on stage with him at the Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting in Omaha: Greg Abel, who runs Berkshire's non-insurance operations and is in line to succeed Buffett as CEO, and Ajit Jain, who heads the insurance business. The author, a long time Berkshire Hathaway shareholder, favors the Japanese horse Forever Young to win Saturday's Kentucky Derby. He will attend the Berkshire annual meeting in Omaha with an eye toward Louisville. "

Instead they will sit rapturously for five hours listening to a 93-year-old man answering questions on the economy — but not just any man: billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Welcome to the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting, dubbed “Woodstock for capitalism” and compared by attendees to going to church or seeing The Beatles live. Inside the CHI Health Center Omaha, ordinary shareholders mingle with celebrities — such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill Murray and Glenn Close — and the biggest names in business, including Bill Gates, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, and Apple’s Tim Cook.  The annual pilgrimage to Omaha is the most fanatical followers of Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, America’s 7th largest company, which owns companies including Geico, Dairy Queen, BNSF Railway and NetJets, and large stakes in Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz and Chevron.  The cost of admission is as low as $396, a single Berkshire Hathaway class B share, but the wisdom dispensed by the man with a net worth of $132 billion is, say attendees, priceless. Christopher Bloomstran has attended every year since 2000 — except once, when his daughter was born two weeks before the meeting— and calls it the “highlight of each year.” “I’ve met some of my best friends in the investment arena at the Berkshire,” said Bloomstran, who is chief investment officer of Semper Augustus Investments Group  in St. Louis, Missouri.  “I go Wednesday and often stay until Monday.”  Adam Mead, who runs Mead Capital Management and has been going for 10 years said: “I don’t go to church but it’s like church: You know what the message will be, it’s the same stories, and you hear current events through the lens of timeless wisdom. “Bill Gates is out there as is Jamie Dimon — he shook my hand and took a pic. One time Warren shook my hand. That was a memorable moment.” The weekend begins Friday when Omaha’s Conference Center opens for conference-goers to pick up credentials for the festivities which include the meeting, a picnic and a 5K. (Buffett does not take part.) But the event’s core is Saturday when Buffett and other Berkshire leaders address the crowd, many of whom arrive at 3am. Chris Fried, an attorney from Pennsylvania, who will be attending for the 10th time always stays in walking distance of the conference center so he is in line by 3AM and prepared for the “mad dash” for the best seats once the doors open and shareholders flood in.  “By 4am – I would say the line is about 100 feet deep,” he said. “By 7 am – it is down several blocks.” Fried said he stumbled on Berkshire when he first read Warren’s annual letter to shareholders 20 years ago.  “It read like beautiful poetry to me and I purchased my first B shares within the week. I haven’t looked back.” In the line he has met Buffett fans from as far afield as Australia, as well as Japan, China, Germany and the UK, many of whom have become friends. “You never know who you’ll bump into,” Friend adds. “One year I sat next to two NFL players.” Mead said: “I’ve made some of my really good friends out there just standing in line. I’m staying in an Airbnb with some of them this year.”  By 8:45AM attendees are ready for Buffett’s annual film which opens the event and which is never seen outside the hall.  Only two still images have ever leaked. One, in 2015, was a pastiche of “Breaking Bad,” with Buffett appearing with Bryan Cranston, its star, to cook, not meth, but See’s Candy, one of the brands which has made Buffett rich. Another, in 2002, was Buffett playing the ukelele.  “He has done skits with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bryan Cranston, Manny Pacquiao, and Jamie Lee Curtis,” Mac Sykes, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Equity Trust, who has been attending for 15 years said. “They’re worth arriving early for.”  This year will be different in part because Charlie Munger, Berkshire’s vice chair and Buffett’s on-stage sidekick until he died at 99 last November, won’t be there for the first time. Elie-Chakib Abou-Chacra, a portfolio manager from Canada who is attending for the second time, said the annual meeting is the equivalent of being a Beatles fan seeing McCartney perform onstage.  “I get to see my hero on stage… if you’re a fan of McCartney or an old rock guy you never know when it will be his last tour but you know you want to see them onstage before they go.” Off stage, the conference center features specialized merch from companies owned by Berkshire, including Squishmallow — who sell a Warren Buffett version of their plush toy — Brooks Sports, Fruit of the Loom, and Dairy Queen.  Buffett tours by golf cart, with people taking selfies as he passes. They also take photos with cutouts of him dotted around the floor. Last year See’s Candies sold Buffett’s fans 11 tons of confectionery which included “Warren’s Favorite Chocolate Walnut Fudge.” Stephen Tedder, an ophthalmologist from Atlanta, told The Post that he fell in love with Buffett’s wisdom after he stumbled on a Berkshire report during the 2008 financial crisis.  “You could see the authentic Midwest moral fiber of Warren and Charlie [Munger], their clarity of thought, written word and plain speak,” he told The Post. This will be his third meeting, having started coming in 2022, because he made a “growing number of good friends.”  Women make up just 20% of attendees, sources told The Post. April Samuelson, a tech worker from Chicago, has attended twice and each time had to explain why she was there solo. “The weird thing about attending as a woman is other investors tended to assume that I was a wife or girlfriend,” Samuelson said.  “I had to clarify that I had stock of my own. When asked why, I just went with ‘I like money.’” Advertisement"

    "content": "Fund next-gen business journalism with $10 a month Search Free Newsletters Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is hosting its annual shareholders meeting Friday through Sunday. The conference, dubbed “Woodstock for Capitalists” by its fans, is a three-day event hosted in Buffett’s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. It’s full of luxurious experiences for Berkshire shareholders, including cocktails, shopping for exclusive jewelry and furniture from top designers, and lots of Dairy Queen (which is owned by Berkshire). But shareholders come for more than just the enticing perks. They wait all year to attend the highly-watched conference for a chance to hear directly from Buffett, known as the Oracle of Omaha. This year, Berkshire vice chairs Ajit Jain and Greg Abel will field questions alongside Buffett during Saturday’s morning question-and-answer session, and Abel and Buffett  will continue on the afternoon shift. In a statement, Buffett said that the three men “will not get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked.” “We know you... will pick some tough ones and that’s the way we like it,” he said. The multinational business conglomerate has been headed by Buffett since 1965, and owns a wide portfolio of businesses mainly in the insurance, rail transportation, energy, manufacturing, and retail sectors. It also has significant holdings in a number of major consumer brands, including Kraft Heinz, American Express, Bank of America, and Coca-Cola. Berkshire has posted year-to-date total returns of almost 12%, outperforming the S&P 500's total returns of almost 8%. Here are three things to watch at this year’s event. During past Berkshire conferences, Buffett has touched on some of the hottest topics of the year, from the regional banking crisis to U.S.-China economic tensions and Bitcoin. This year, Buffett has said that questions about what stocks Berkshire is buying and selling — despite that being public information — are off the table for discussion. So is politics. Nevertheless, investors will likely want a glimpse into the Oracle’s views on the wars in the Gaza Strip and Ukraine, interest rates, and other policy issues that are relevant to Berkshire’s business and the wider economy.  Read more: Warren Buffett doesn’t trust pundits and more takeaways from his annual note to shareholders While he likely won’t comment on something as concrete as who he’s voting for in the year’s presidential election, there’s a good chance some policy discussion will make it into the Q&A session. There may also be questions about artificial intelligence and tech stocks, given Berkshire’s outsize holdings in Apple, Amazon, and cloud data-warehousing firm Snowflake. Mainly, people just like to hear what Buffett thinks about whatever he’s thinking about. Whether that’s life lessons or investment insights, when Buffett talks, investors listen. Abel, who serves as chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and vice-chairman of non-insurance operations, is in line to succeed the 93-year-old Buffett as CEO.  The Canadian businessman was tapped  as heir apparent in 2021, when Buffett told CNBC that if something were to happen to him that night, the board of directors was in agreement that “it would be Greg who’d take over tomorrow morning.” Abel will have a starring role this year, appearing at both Q&A sessions. During last year’s conference, the late Charlie Munger heaped praise on Abel, calling him “sensational at being a business leader, both as a thinker and as a doer.” “There’s some things he’s better at than Warren is, and Warren knows that, and he just keeps dumping on Greg everything that Greg can do better, and that’s a lot,” Munger said. This is the first annual Berkshire shareholders meeting without Buffett’s right-hand business partner and friend, Charlie Munger. Munger served as vice chairman of Berkshire since 1978. He died in November, just weeks before his 100th birthday.  Guests would often look forward to the pair’s anecdotes and humor — both business-related and not — which tended to be a highlight of the annual conference. One long-time conference attendee told The Wall Street Journal that this year’s meeting will have “an empty-chair feeling” to it without Munger.

    "content": "The claims have been filed in a state court in Portland as part of a class action lawsuit by 1,000 victims of the fires. PacifiCorp, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, is facing $30bn in claims from victims of the 2020 Labor Day wildfires in Oregon, US. The demand is a significant increase in the legal challenges faced by the utility, which is one of the largest grid operators in the country. \n                        The gold standard of business intelligence.\n                     \n                            Find out more\n                            \n\n\n\n The claims have been filed in a state court in Portland as part of a class action lawsuit by 1,000 victims seeking compensation for the destruction of 2,500 properties in western Oregon. Each claimant is seeking up to $30m – $5m for tangible losses and up to $25m for intangible losses such as emotional distress. The amount sought in the amended complaint is roughly two and a half times the value of the utility itself, and significantly exceeds payouts from all claims resolved to date. In a previous legal decision, a jury ordered PacifiCorp to pay $90m to 17 claimants for gross negligence due to the utility’s failure to shut down power lines during a windstorm.

Despite being found liable for its role in the fires, PacifiCorp is appealing the verdict and has criticised the plaintiffs’ demands as excessive. The company stated: “The $30m demand for each plaintiff clearly demonstrates the need for some manner of reform in the legal process. “PacifiCorp’s ability to provide essential services is being threatened by excessive wildfire damages pursued by plaintiff’s attorneys who have a substantial financial stake in these outcomes.” The issue of wildfire liability is not unique to PacifiCorp; it has become a concern for utilities across the western US, with Berkshire chairman Warren Buffett highlighting the risk in his annual letter to investors. Berkshire Hathaway has acknowledged facing fire claims in Oregon and California amounting to $8bn, including more than $1bn from government agencies for firefighting and clean-up costs.  The utility’s failure to act on weather warnings and shut off electricity ahead of the windstorm was a focal point of the 2023 trial.

    "content": "      Berkshire Hathaway Inc will announce its first quarter earnings on Saturday, May 4, 2024. The billionaire Warren Buffett-led company will hold its 2024 Annual Shareholders Meeting on May 4.     Prior to the Annual Shareholders Meeting, Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Greg Abel, Vice Chairman Non-Insurance Operations and Ajit Jain, Vice Chairman Insurance Operations, will hold a question-and-answer session that will commence at approximately 9:15 a.m. Central time, the company said.     The Berkshire Hathaway AGM, which attracts thousands of people to Omaha to hear from legendary investor Warren Buffett, won’t be the same this year due to the absence of his friend and investing partner Charlie Munger.  Also Read: ‘Empty chair feeling’ to pervade Berkshire meeting without Munger    Munger, who was the former Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman, passed away last November at 99 years old.     It will be for the first time when the Berkshire Hathaway AGM will be held without Munger alongside Buffett.    Traditionally, the duo shared insights into their investment portfolios and strategies, offering invaluable financial and life advice to investors.    In February, Buffett paid tribute to Munger when he prefaced his annual letter to shareholders with a page titled “Charlie Munger — The Architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"    “Charlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me take the bows and receive the accolades,\" Buffett wrote.

Discovery. Since April's labor report was weaker than expected, he said investors can worry less about the Federal Reserve's next move. \"Now that it's clear the economy's having a meaningful slowdown, we no longer need to worry about the Fed becoming our enemy again,\" he said, adding, \"Which means we can go back to glorious stock picking mode, at least for like a couple of days, thanks to the benign employment number.\" On Saturday, Cramer said investors should follow Warren Buffett's annual meeting, which could be bullish for Berkshire Hathaway and stocks in its portfolio such as American Express, Apple, Coca-Cola and Occidental Petroleum. Monday brings earnings from Simon Property Group and Tyson Foods, the latter of which Cramer said he thinks could be a \"bounce-back play.\" Disney reports on Tuesday before the bell, and Cramer said he expects results to be positive after the cost cuts and initiatives management put in place to win its recent proxy battle. Wynn Resorts and Reddit also release earnings that day, and Cramer said he thinks both could put up solid numbers. Cramer will be paying attention to Uber's report on Wednesday, saying he wonders whether its earnings will be hurt by competition from Lyft. Toyota, Arm, Robinhood, Trade Desk, AMC Entertainment and Airbnb also report. He said he thinks Robinhood will do well because cryptocurrency remains popular. Roblox reports Thursday and Cramer said he expects it to be positive. Warner Bros. Discovery also reports, and Cramer said he wonders whether the company has lowered its debt and if it will keep its contract with the National Basketball Association. He said he is also interested to hear from Akamai Technologies and Tapestry. The latter's report could address the Federal Trade Commission's suit to stop its merger with Capri. On Friday, Cramer will be waiting for earnings from Enbridge. He said some investors are skeptical the company can pay its dividend. To Cramer, the dividend is safe, but he said he needs to see more aggressive growth to justify owning the stock.

With over 20,000 square feet of showroom space and more than 50,000 items of inventory, the exhibit hall at the CHI Health Center features goodies from various Berkshire's holding companies, from Brooks Running to See's Candies to Jazwares. Only shareholders can participate at the event and they can buy items at a special discount. The annual meeting will be exclusively broadcast on CNBC and livestreamed on CNBC.com. The special coverage will begin Saturday at 9:30 a.m. ET. Jazwares, the American toymaker best known for its Squishmallows plushie line, was a hit last year when it first displayed its wares at Berkshire Hathaway's conference, including the debut of a Warren Buffett plushie. This year, the company expanded its exhibit in the convention hall, making it three times larger. Some highlights include the latest Squishmallows toys in the images of Buffett and his longtime Berkshire partner, Charlie Munger, a splashy Squishmallows pit, as well as other displays. The Bookworm only had one book to sell this year: \"Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Essential Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger.\" That was at the request of Buffett in honor of his business partner of more than 60 years, who passed away in November at the age of 99. Berkshire acquired pilot training company FlightSafety in 1996. At Friday's shopping event, the firm brought a taste of what its training program looks like for professional pilots. Shareholders lined up to put on virtual reality glasses and experience the flight simulation training. Truck-stop giant Pilot Travel Centers put up a big display with a real-sized red truck. The firm is largest operator of travel centers in North America, with more than 750 locations. Berkshire now fully owns Pilot Travel after buying the remaining 20% ownership interest from the Haslam family. The deal was not without drama as the Haslams last year sued Berkshire in a complaint that accused the conglomerate of using so-called pushdown accounting without authorization from the family. About 14 miles away from the main convention center, there's a separate shareholder-only shopping event at Berkshire-owned Jewelry store Borsheims. Shareholders browsed through one-of-a-kind jewelry, engagement rings and watches available for purchase at a discount. This 40-carat diamond bracelet from Ruchi New York was selling for $110,000 (picture above, on the left). In 2016, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought Duracell from Procter & Gamble, offering the consumer giant $4.7 billion of the shares it owned in P&G in exchange for the battery maker. Brooks Running attracted a long line of shareholders snapping up the 2024 special edition of its running shoes with \"brk\" on the side and a cartoon of a running Buffett on the insoles. Many shareholders are also set to participate in the Brooks \"Invest in Yourself\" 5K fun run and walk on Sunday, the morning following the annual meeting. Warren Buffett bought Dairy Queen in 1998 in a roughly $600 million transaction, and has made trips to the Omaha locations with his great-grandchildren.

You can opt out anytime.\t\t\t\t Tomorrow (May 4), Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) will kick off its annual shareholder meeting in the investing conglomerate’s home base in Omaha, Neb. This year, Buffett will host the meeting without his right-hand man, Charlie Munger, who passed away late last year at the age of 99. Thousands of Berkshire shareholders will look for updates on  Buffett’s succession plan as well as his next big bet, as the company is also set to report first-quarter earnings tomorrow morning. It will not be the first time Buffett leads the shareholder meeting by himself, though. He held Berkshire’s 2020 meeting—virtually due to Covid-19—without Munger and said, “It particularly doesn’t feel like an annual meeting because my partner of 60 years, Charlie Munger, is not sitting up here.” Munger’s passing in November put Berkshire’s energy business chief Greg Abel and insurance chief Ajit Jain in the spotlight. In 2021, Munger revealed at that year’s shareholder meeting that Abel would succeed Buffett as CEO if anything happened to the CEO. “The directors are in agreement that if something were to happen to me tonight, it would be Greg who’d take over tomorrow morning,” Buffett told CNBC subsequently. He added that, if for some reason Abel couldn’t do the job, Jain would step in as CEO. Abel, 59, and Jain, 70, were promoted to vice chairmen of Berkshire Hathaway’s board in 2018 and have taken on a larger role in recent years. “Ajit and Greg have rare talents, and Berkshire blood flows through their veins,” Buffett wrote in his 2018 letter to shareholders.  In April this year, Abel joined Buffett on his business trip to Japan, where he made large investments in the country’s top trading houses. Abel “does all the work, and I take the bows—it’s exactly what I wanted,” Buffett told CNBC at the time. Another item in focus at tomorrow’s meeting will be Buffett’s next big bet, especially given Berkshire’s giant cash pile. At the end of 2023, Berkshire had a record $168 billion in cash. Shareholders are eager to know how Buffett plans to invest that money. During the December quarter, Berkshire reduced its stake in Apple (its largest holding), Paramount Global and HP while increasing shares in Chevron, Occidental Petroleum and Sirius XM Holdings. Also late last year, Berkshire acquired a mystery stock that the company requested the SEC for permission to keep confidential. Shareholders may expect the company to share more details about that as well. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

He's emerged in recent years as one of Apple's top evangelists. At the end of 2023, Berkshire owned about 6% of Apple, a stake worth $174 billion at the time, or about 40% of the conglomerate's total value. That's about four times bigger than Berkshire's second-biggest public stock holding, Bank of America, and makes the company the No. 2 Apple shareholder, behind only Vanguard. As Berkshire investors and fanboys of the 93-year-old Buffett flood Omaha this weekend for the 2024 annual meeting, Apple is likely to be a hot topic of discussion. The tech giant on Thursday reported a 10% year-over-year decline in iPhone sales, leading to a 4% drop in total revenue. But the stock had its best day since late 2022 on Friday due largely to a $110 billion stock buyback plan and increased margins that result from a growing services business. The bet on Apple and CEO Tim Cook has paid off handsomely for Buffett, who said in 2022 that the cost of Berkshire's Apple stake was only $31 billion. His firm is up almost 620% on its investment since the start of 2016. Despite being a self-described Luddite, Buffett has long had a coherent non-techie thesis for loving Apple. He's seen how devoted Apple users are to their devices, and has viewed the iPhone as an extraordinary product that could keep its customers spending inside the Apple ecosystem. He calls it a moat, one of his favorite words for describing his preferred businesses. \"Apple has a position with consumers that they're paying $1,500 or whatever it may be for a phone, and these same people pay $35,000 for a second car,\" Buffett said at last year's meeting. \"And if they had to give up their second car or give up their iPhone, they'd give up their second car!\" Data is in his favor. According to a study from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, Apple benefits from 94% customer loyalty, meaning that nine out of 10 current U.S. iPhone owners choose another iPhone when buying a new device. Buffett also has hailed Apple's ability to return billions of dollars to shareholders annually through share buybacks and dividends, a capital allocation strategy for which the billionaire investor may have himself to thank. When the Apple CEO was asked in a 2016 interview with The Washington Post who he turns to for advice at pivotal moments, Cook offered up a story about his relationship with Buffett. \"When I was going through [the question of] what should we do on returning cash to shareholders, I thought who could really give us great advice here? Who wouldn't have a bias?\" Cook said. \"So I called up Warren Buffett. I thought he's the natural person.\" Apple has shown its appreciation for the Oracle of Omaha in other ways. In 2019, the company published an original iPhone game called \"Warren Buffett's Paper Wizard\" in which a paperboy bikes from Omaha to Apple's hometown of Cupertino, California. But with Apple's business having declined in size in five of the past six quarters and with the company expecting just low single-digit growth in the current quarter, Buffett may face questions this weekend at the shareholder meeting about whether he still sees the same power in the moat, particularly with regulatory pressures building around tech's mega-cap companies. Buffett trimmed his stake in Apple late last year, though only by about 1%. Even after Friday's rally, the stock is down 3.8% in 2024, while the S&P 500 is up 7.5%. Berkshire's initial foray into Apple in 2016 was not Buffett's idea. Rather, the investment was led by Ted Weschler, one of his top deputies, and was seen as a passing of the torch to the next generation of Berkshire investment managers. But the following year, Berkshire started purchasing even more Apple shares, and Buffett began talking it up. He said he liked the stock and the company's \"sticky\" product, although he didn't use it. In 2018, he said Apple users are \"very, very, very locked in, at least psychologically and mentally\" to the product and the ecosystem. \"Apple has an extraordinary consumer franchise,\" he said. At last year's annual meeting, when asked how Berkshire can defend having Apple make up so much of its public portfolio, Buffett said, \"It just happens to be a better business than any we own.\" He also hailed Cook, calling him one of the \"best managers in the world.\" A number Apple likes to use to tout the health of its business, despite the declining revenue, is \"2.2 billion.\" That's how many devices the company says are currently in use and points to the massive customer base available as Apple rolls out new subscription services. \"Once customers get into the ecosystem, they don't leave. So it's not a speculative tech play,\" said Dan Eye, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which owns Apple shares. \"It's kind of more like an annuity and I think that's what Warren Buffett really sees as well.\" In addition to the drop in revenue, Apple faces new challenges from regulations and weak overseas markets, as well as from Microsoft and Google's advancements in artificial intelligence. For regulators, the concern surrounds the very moat that Buffett finds so attractive, and whether it gives the company monopolistic control in the smartphone market. The U.S. government in March alleged that Apple designs its business to keep customers locked in. The Department of Justice's lawsuit claimed that products like Apple Card, the Apple Arcade game subscription, iMessage and Apple Watch work best or only with an iPhone, creating illegal barriers to competition and making it harder for consumers to switch when it's time for an upgrade. However, the litigation is expected to take years, pushing any potential penalties to Apple and its products well into the future. In the meantime, there's no sign that the iPhone is becoming less important as new devices like virtual reality goggles have found only niche audiences, while consumer AI products have failed to take off. Buffett hasn't voiced his view publicly on Apple's regulatory hurdles, and this will be the first opportunity for investors to ask him about the issue since the DOJ's lawsuit. But Buffett knows a little something about regulation — two markets where he's most active are railroads and insurance. In a note to clients earlier this month, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi didn't go deep on regulatory concerns, but mentioned that he doesn't believe the DOJ suit will \"seriously threaten\" the strength of Apple's ecosystem. He also said that following Buffett's lead on getting in and out of Apple is a solid strategy for making money. \"Despite his reputation as a long term buy and hold investor, Warren Buffett has been remarkably disciplined at adding to his Apple position when it is relatively cheap and trimming when it is relatively expensive,\" Sacconaghi wrote. He encouraged investors to \"be like Buffett.\" Odds are that Buffett was thrilled with Apple's announcement this week regarding its expanded repurchase program. It's a practice he's long adored. \"When I buy Apple, I know that Apple is going to repurchase a lot of shares,\" he said in 2018.  And he likes to note how buybacks result in getting a bigger stake in the company without buying more shares. \"The math of repurchases grinds away slowly, but can be powerful over time,\" Buffett said in 2021. Apple also increased its dividend by 4%, and signaled that it would continue to lift it annually. Buffett was effusive about the tech giant's capital-return strategy at the conglomerate's annual meeting last year, pointing out that it helped Berkshire own a bigger piece of the pie. Unlike insurance company Geico and homebuilder Clayton Homes, which his firm owns in their entirety, Berkshire can continue to increase its stake in Apple, a fact he reminded investors of at the meeting. \"The good thing about Apple is that we can go up,\" Buffett said.

O encontro anual de acionistas da Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), empresa do megainvestidor Warren Buffett, será no sábado (4) – e quem se deslocou até o interior dos Estados Unidos para participar está cheio de expectativa. “Estar entre tantos investidores de ponta é um aprendizado por si só, e ver Buffett falando sobre a Berkshire e o mercado é uma oportunidade”, diz o analista brasileiro Rodrigo Medeiros, que está pela primeira vez no evento. “Ver presencialmente é diferente de ver pela internet”. Leia também: InfoMoney vai a Omaha para conferência anual da Berkshire Hathaway, de Warren Buffett Continua depois da publicidade A reunião da Berkshire é diferente da maioria dos encontros com acionistas promovidos por outras empresas. De um lado, o dia é uma vitrine para as muitas companhias nas quais Buffett tem participação – elas montam estandes na CHI Health Center Arena, em Omaha, no estado de Nebraska, onde ocorre o evento. De outro, os participantes têm a chance real de fazer perguntas diretamente a Buffett – que será acompanhado no palco por Greg Abel, responsável pelas operações não relacionadas a seguros da Berkshire, e por Ajit Jain, que supervisiona especificamente os negócios de seguros. Os três podem responder até 60 perguntas durante a reunião. Baixe um ebook gratuito que revela o método Warren Buffett de investir em ações Continua depois da publicidade Eliseu Manica Júnior gostaria que uma das perguntas respondidas fosse a sua. Ele é o fundador da Experato, assessoria de investimentos de Santo Ângelo, no Rio Grande do Sul, e está entre as dezenas de brasileiros participantes da conferência deste ano. É sua quinta vez no evento – e nessa, perguntaria a Buffett: “Com a ascensão de novas tecnologias, como inteligência artificial e blockchain, como o senhor adapta sua estratégia de investimento para identificar e avaliar as vantagens competitivas duráveis em empresas, especialmente aquelas que operam em setores tradicionais?” Da comunidade brasileira ouvida pelo InfoMoney em Omaha, Manica Júnior está entre os investidores “veteranos” na Berkshire – ele tem os papéis desde 2019, período em que calcula ter ganhado cerca de 100% com eles. Já Lucas Biolchini, analista da XP Asset, é mais recente na base acionária da empresa. Investe há cerca de um ano e meio, com ganhos de 30%. Ir à conferência era um desejo antigo, diz Biolchini, acelerado pelo falecimento de Charlie Munger – o sócio de longa data de Buffett morreu em novembro de 2023, aos 99 anos. “A chance de ‘respirar o ar de Omaha’ e de conhecer pessoas do mundo todo que também têm Buffett, Munger e a Berkshire como inspirações me animou”. Sua pergunta ao megainvestidor? Continua depois da publicidade “Perguntaria sobre os recentes investimentos em empresas japonesas, para entender melhor sua visão sobre o perfil de crescimento delas e a alocação de capital” A edição de 2024 também é a estreia de Renato Breia, sócio-fundador da Nord Investimentos, nas conferências da Berkshire. Só a “caravana” da Nord seguiu para Omaha com 12 pessoas. “Faria a ele uma pergunta sobre investimento de longo prazo”, diz. “ Com o mundo mudando tão rapidamente rápido , o ‘long term investment’ ficou mais ‘short’? As mudanças no portfólio dele também aceleraram” Entre outras perguntas que podem ser endereçadas a Buffett há temas mais espinhosos – riscos climáticos, por exemplo. A empresa de energia PacifiCorp – que está no portfólio da Berkshire – é alvo de reclamações de responsabilidade por incêndios no Oregon em 2020. Outras investidas também enfrentaram litígios que podem despertar a curiosidade dos investidores. A imobiliária HomeServices of America assinou recentemente um acordo de US$ 250 milhões (R$ 1,3 bilhão) para liquidar uma ação judicial envolvendo comissões pagas aos corretores. Ainda nesta semana, foi alvo de uma nova reclamação de um grupo de compradores de casas, acusando a corretora de inflacionar as comissões. Continua depois da publicidade Buffett costuma ver seu vasto império empresarial como um barômetro da saúde econômica dos EUA – e muitos investidores devem buscar indicações quanto a isso na sessão de perguntas e respostas. A inflação e os juros mais altos podem pesar sobre os negócios industriais, de serviços e de varejo da Berkshire, embora essas operações tenham se mostrado resilientes. No ano passado, ele previu que a maioria das empresas da Berkshire reportaria ganhos mais baixos – o que não aconteceu. A empresa teve lucros operacionais de US$ 8,48 bilhões no quarto trimestre, acima dos US$ 6,63 bilhões do ano anterior.

Milhares de investidores estão se dirigindo para Omaha neste fim de semana, o que só pode significar uma coisa: chegou a hora da assembleia anual de acionistas da Berkshire Hathaway, um evento apelidado de “Woodstock Capitalista”.O fascínio sempre foi a oportunidade de ver Warren Buffett e Charlie Munger ao vivo, respondendo às perguntas dos participantes em uma performance de comédia entre amigos testada e comprovada pelo tempo. Mas o evento deste ano será o primeiro sem a presença de Munger, que morreu em novembro aos 99 anos, e ocorre em meio a dúvidas cada vez maiores sobre a Berkshire depois de Buffett, que hoje está com 93 anos. Continua depois da publicidade Baixe um ebook gratuito que revela o método Warren Buffett de investir em ações Neste sábado (4), Buffett terá ao seu lado uma equipe diferente respondendo às perguntas. Greg Abel e Ajit Jain, vice-presidentes da Berkshire, estarão presentes durante grande parte do dia. Os acionistas provavelmente estarão focados no que Abel, o sucessor nomeado por Buffett para assumir o cargo de CEO e responsável pelas operações não relacionadas a seguros do conglomerado, terá a dizer. Na carta anual de Buffett aos investidores, ele fez referência aos desafios enfrentados pelas maiores empresas da Berkshire, dentre as quais a ferrovia BNSF (queda nos volumes de embarques) e seu negócio de utilities (incêndios florestais). No mês passado, a enorme corretora imobiliária da empresa, a HomeServices of America, também concordou em desembolsar US$ 250 milhões para fechar acordos em processos judiciais relativos a comissões inflacionadas por vendas de imóveis. Continua depois da publicidade Leia mais: InfoMoney vai a Omaha para conferência anual da Berkshire Hathaway Os acionistas podem estar interessados em ouvir as opiniões de Jain, mentor de longa data das vitais operações de resseguro da Berkshire, sobre o negócio que sustenta a maior parte dos investimentos de Buffett. Certamente haverá muitas perguntas sobre os investimentos exclusivos da Berkshire. O desempenho das ações da empresa este ano ultrapassou o da Apple (um dos maiores investimentos de Buffett; leia mais sobre isso abaixo), da Microsoft e da Tesla, bem como o do S&P 500. Continua depois da publicidade Com as taxas de juros permanecendo mais elevadas por mais tempo e as ações de muitos gigantes da tecnologia perdendo força, os acionistas estarão interessados em saber onde Buffett enxerga oportunidades futuras. Elas podem incluir investimentos da empresa na petroleira Occidental Petroleum e em cinco tradings japoneses, cujas ações dispararam. Os participantes também podem desejar ouvir Buffett explicar qual teria sido sua admissão mais significativa nos últimos anos: hoje, a Berkshire é tão grande que é pouco provável que ela encontre quaisquer aquisições importantes – a fonte histórica dos descomunais retornos sobre os investimentos de Buffett – na qual gastar sua fabulosa fortuna estimada em US$ 163 bilhões. “Em suma, não haverá um desempenho de encher os olhos”, escreveu Buffet na carta anual deste ano. E pode haver incertezas sobre quem será responsável por selecionar as ações para Buffett. Todd Combs e Ted Weschler gerenciam partes do portfólio de investimentos da Berkshire há anos. No entanto, o desempenho deles tem ficado muito aquém do alcançado pelo próprio Buffett e do S&P 500, o que levanta dúvidas sobre a futura proposta de valor da Berkshire.

    "description": "For divestment from Israel to actually work, students and administrators must change their tactics, writes Scott Warren.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-03T17:11:13Z",
    "content": "As a former student activist, it’s been a surreal experience following the pro-Palestinian protests occurring at universities across the country. Almost 20 years ago, I helped lead national efforts across the country to divest universities, cities, and states from foreign companies aiding and abetting the genocide in Darfur, Sudan—the last effort that inspired massive divestiture action from institutions of higher education across the country. Despite our successful divestment efforts, the situation in Darfur is once again at a dire point, with a humanitarian disaster looming. This time, very few are sounding the alarm. Looking back on our efforts to divest American entities from companies in Sudan, two critical lessons emerge: First, a targeted approach to divestment is crucial to any potential campaign victory. Secondly, divestment on its own, while potentially important, is ultimately an insufficient tool in materially changing the situation on the ground, especially without long-term, sustained activism and engagement. In 2005, the genocide in Darfur captured the attention of thousands of college students across the country. Protesting a regime that massacred up to 400,000 of its own people through use of militia groups in the western region of Sudan, students organized massive protests in Washington, DC and their own campuses, pushed for congressional action, and engaged in acts of civil disobedience. Students also helped to lead a nationwide divestment movement, lobbying universities and states to pull their investments out of companies directly or indirectly aiding the government to carry out the atrocities. Ultimately,  35 states, including California and Texas, divested from Sudan, and over 50 universities participated in the effort. I helped to lead national efforts as the Student Director for STAND: A Student Anti-Genocide Coalition, and worked on successful campaigns to convince my alma-mater Brown University, the City of Providence, and the State of Rhode Island to divest their assets from Sudan. We engaged in a purposefully targeted approach, using research to determine lists of specific companies that were engaged in business activities that could be demonstrated to support and facilitate the Sudanese government’s internationally recognized genocidal actions and human rights violations. This list included Chinese and Russian oil and gas companies, as it could be proven that oil revenues helped pad the coffers of the murderous regime. The divestiture efforts were also explicitly targeted at universities’ direct investments, which comprise only about 5% of most endowments. Indeed, in a case like Brown, the university was not directly invested in any of the companies targeted, but rather, put them on a do-not-invest list as a result of our efforts. The rest of the university endowment is invested in commingled or mutual funds (this reality did lead to students pushing fund managers like Fidelity Investments and Berkshire Hathaway to divest from Sudan). Recognizing that the primary responsibility of the investment office is to secure a high rate of return for fiduciaries, and not to make political statements, this targeted approach also enables investment managers to easily replace any divested assets with similar companies. It’s difficult to speak to every university’s current demands for divestment concerning Israel, but focusing on Brown University’s campaign may be instructive. First, Brown’s response has stood out because the University Administration agreed to present divestment from Israel as an option to Brown’s Corporation, which is the equivalent of the Board of Directors. Given the vast number of universities that divested from Sudan, and in the 1990’s from South Africa, most institutions have a process in place to explore the financial action. Irrespective of their opinions on the merits of divestment in this case, it’s disappointing that, at a base level, most administrators are refusing to even explore these processes. Read More: What to Know About the Global Boycott Movement Against Israel Secondly, Brown’s campaign has been specific about its demands for divestiture. The students are not asking for divestment from every company linked to Israel (which is the unrealistic ask of Columbia University students) or even Israeli companies (which University of Michigan students want).  Brown Divest has stated its goal is “divestment from companies which profit from human rights abuses in Palestine.” In that vein, the group has outlined criteria to identify such companies, including those that provide products or services that contribute to the maintenance of the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, and those that provide products or services that contribute to violent acts. From this criteria, the students identified 10 specific companies that would be targeted for divestment. This is not to argue that Brown should, or will, divest from these companies.  But the process of identifying criteria, focusing on a university's direct investments, and presenting recommendations to the Corporation for a vote are all responsible actions by the students and administrators alike. This targeted campaign is the only approach towards divestment that has any potential for success. Even if targeted divestment efforts are successful, the most important question, which remains currently unanswerable, is whether these campaigns would actually make a difference on the ground. Despite our successful divestment campaigns 20 years ago, Darfur is collapsing yet again. Sudan’s military is engaged in a fight for power with the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group, causing the biggest humanitarian crisis in decades. There are concrete actions that the United States can take, including pushing for negotiations, engaging in targeted sanctions, and leading anti-money laundering measures. This time around, however, there is essentially no domestic political will for taking action. Student activism has died out for the cause. It’s counterproductive to engage in conflict comparisons between Gaza and Sudan. Student activists today would argue that U.S. taxpayers are subsidizing the Israeli government’s actions, whereas the situation in Sudan is less directly tied to our actions. Both situations, however, are tragic, and tens of thousands innocent human lives are being lost. If student activists today want to make a difference in the situation in Gaza, there are lessons to be learned from our work in Sudan. First, if they want to be successful in divestiture efforts, the work needs to be targeted. And secondly, students must recognize that the work to push for a peaceful Middle East will take a generation. I look at the protests today with a deep belief in the power of collective action and recognizing students’ rights to organize in the face of injustice. I also note that this issue is much more contentious than the genocide in Darfur, which was universally condemned by Americans. What is clear, though, is that both the protestors and university administrators need to change their tactics. It’s imperative that today’s student activists do not look back in 15 years with a situation in Gaza that mirrors, or is worse, than today’s morass. Contact us at letters@time.com"

The identity of the stock — or stocks — that Berkshire has been snapping up could be revealed Saturday at the company's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. That's because unless Berkshire has been granted confidential treatment on the investment for a third quarter in a row, the stake will be disclosed in filings later this month. So the 93-year-old Berkshire CEO may decide to explain his rationale to the thousands of investors flocking to the gathering. The bet, shrouded in mystery, has captivated Berkshire investors since it first appeared in disclosures late last year. At a time when Buffett has been a net seller of stocks and lamented a dearth of opportunities capable of \"truly moving the needle at Berkshire,\" he has apparently found something he likes — and in the financial realm no less. That's an area he has dialed back on in recent years over concerns about rising loan defaults. High interest rates have taken a toll on some financial players like regional U.S. banks, while making the yield on Berkshire's cash pile in instruments like T-bills suddenly attractive. \"When you are the GOAT of investing, people are interested in what you think is good,\" said Glenview Trust Co. Chief Investment Officer Bill Stone, using an acronym for greatest of all time. \"What makes it even more exciting is that banks are in his circle of competence.\" Under Buffett, Berkshire has trounced the S&P 500 over nearly six decades with a 19.8% compounded annual gain, compared with the 10.2% yearly rise of the index. Coverage note: The annual meeting will be exclusively broadcast on CNBC and livestreamed on CNBC.com. Our special coverage will begin Saturday at 9:30 a.m. ET. Berkshire requested anonymity for the trades because if the stock was known before the conglomerate finished building its position, others would plow into the stock as well, driving up the price, according to David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland. Buffett is said to control roughly 90% of Berkshire's massive stock portfolio, leaving his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler the rest, Kass said. While investment disclosures give no clue as to what the stock could be, Stone, Kass and other Buffett watchers believe it is a multibillion-dollar wager on a financial name. That's because the cost basis of banks, insurers and finance stocks owned by the company jumped by $3.59 billion in the second half of last year, the only category to increase, according to separate Berkshire filings. At the same time, Berkshire exited financial names by dumping insurers Markel and Globe Life, leading investors to estimate that the wager could be as large as $4 billion or $5 billion through the end of 2023. It's unknown whether that bet was on one company or spread over multiple firms in an industry. If it were a classic Buffett bet — a big stake in a single company —  that stock would have to be a large one, with perhaps a $100 billion market capitalization. Holdings of at least 5% in publicly traded American companies trigger disclosure requirements. Investors have been speculating for months about what the stock could be. Finance covers all manner of companies, from retail lenders to Wall Street brokers, payments companies and various sectors of insurance. Charles Schwab or Morgan Stanley could fit the bill, according to James Shanahan, an Edward Jones analyst who covers banks and Berkshire Hathaway. \"Schwab was beaten down during the regional banking crisis last year, they had an issue where retail investors were trading out of cash into higher-yielding investments,\" Shanahan said. \"Nobody wanted to own that name last year, so Buffett could've bought as much as he wanted.\" Other names that have been circulated — JPMorgan Chase or BlackRock, for example, are possible, but may make less sense given valuations or business mix. Truist and other higher-quality regional banks might also fit Buffett's parameters, as well as insurer AIG, Shanahan said, though their market capitalizations are smaller. Berkshire has owned financial names for decades, and Buffett has stepped in to inject capital — and confidence — into the industry on multiple occasions. Buffett served as CEO of a scandal-stricken Salomon Brothers in the early 1990s to help turn the company around. He pumped $5 billion into Goldman Sachs in 2008 and another $5 billion into Bank of America in 2011, ultimately becoming the latter's largest shareholder. But after loading up on lenders in 2018, from universal banks like JPMorgan to regional lenders like PNC Financial and U.S. Bank, he deeply pared his exposure to the sector in 2020 on concerns that the coronavirus pandemic would punish the industry. Since then, he and his deputies have mostly avoided adding to his finance stakes, besides modest positions in Citigroup and Capital One. Last May, Buffett told shareholders to expect more turbulence in banking. He said Berkshire could deploy more capital in the industry, if needed. \"The situation in banking is very similar to what it's always been in banking, which is that fear is contagious,\" Buffett said. \"Historically, sometimes the fear was justified, sometimes it wasn't.\" Wherever he placed his bet, the move will be seen as a boost to the company, perhaps even the sector, given Buffett's track record of identifying value. It's unclear how long regulators will allow Berkshire to shield its moves. \"I'm hopeful he'll reveal the name and talk about the strategy behind it,\" Shanahan said. \"The SEC's patience can wear out, at some point it'll look like Berkshire's getting favorable treatment.\" — CNBC's Yun Li contributed to this report.

Some 30,000 rapt shareholders are descending on Omaha for what's been called \"Woodstock for Capitalists.\" Pandemic lockdown apart, it will be the first without Munger, Buffett's longtime partner who passed away in November about a month shy of his 100th birthday. \"The meeting will only have one comedian up there\" this year, said David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland and a Berkshire shareholder, who has attended more than 20 annual meetings. \"There'll be, let's say, a more serious, less humorous background.\" The annual meeting will be exclusively broadcast on CNBC and livestreamed on CNBC.com. Our special coverage will begin Saturday at 9:30 a.m. ET. For the first time, Berkshire will broadcast its annual meeting movie that had previously always been reserved only for those in attendance in Omaha. Many speculate this year's will be a tear-jerker tribute to Munger. Vice Chairman of Non-Insurance Operations Greg Abel, Buffett's designated successor, will fill Munger's seat in the afternoon session, helping answer shareholder questions. Vice Chairman of Insurance Operations Ajit Jain will join Buffett, the CEO, and Abel in the morning session. Buffett has said they expect to field about 40 to 60 questions Saturday. \"The tone of the meeting is certainly going to be a lot different without Charlie,\" said Steve Check, CEO of Check Capital Management and a longtime Berkshire shareholder. \"He was the one that really made it funny. It's getting closer and closer to the transition, so it's good to see Ajit and Greg on the stage.\" Munger's investment philosophy rubbed off on Buffett early on, giving rise to the sprawling conglomerate worth $860 billion that Berkshire is today. Generations of investors also appreciated Munger's trademark bluntness and humor, rare to come by on Wall Street. If anything, the sea of Buffett admirers will cherish his folksy wisdom even more as the \"Oracle of Omaha\" turns 94 in less than four months. Here are some of the big topics shareholders want Buffett to discuss: The annual meeting comes at a tricky time for markets as a pickup in inflation puts the brakes on the Federal Reserve's plan to cut interest rates this year. While the Berkshire CEO doesn't make investment decisions based on daily headlines, investors still are eager to hear any market commentary and guidance from the protege of the father of value investing, Ben Graham. \"They don't time their investments,\" Kass said of Berkshire. \"The economy goes through cycles. They totally ignore cycles. They invest for a long run, and they really ignore what pretty much what the Federal Reserve is doing. I believe that will be his answer.\" Shareholders may seek an explanation as to why Berkshire sold about 10 million Apple shares (1% of its massive stake) in the fourth quarter. At the end of 2023, Berkshire owned 905,560,000 shares of the iPhone maker, worth more than $174 billion and taking up more than 40% of the portfolio. The move came as a surprise to many because Apple has been Buffett's favorite stock for years, and he even called the tech giant his second-most important business after Berkshire's cluster of insurers. What's more, the last time Buffett trimmed this bet, he admitted it was \"probably a mistake.' Shares of the iPhone maker got a big boost Friday after the firm announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in company history. However, Apple posted a decline in overall sales and in iPhone sales. There's a small chance that Buffett will reveal the identity of the mystery bank stock that Berkshire has been buying for two quarters straight. In the third and fourth quarters of 2023, Berkshire requested that the Securities and Exchange Commission keep the details of one or more of its stock holdings confidential. Many speculated that the secret purchase could be a bank stock as the conglomerate's cost basis for \"banks, insurance, and finance\" equity holdings jumped by around $2.37 billion. \"He will comment as late as possible.... Charlie would be the only one that would let it slip once in a while. It's not going to happen with Warren,\" Check said. Berkshire's succession could be front and center at this meeting after Munger's passing. Abel, became known as Buffett's heir apparent in 2021 after Munger inadvertently made the revelation. Abel has been overseeing a major portion of Berkshire's sprawling empire, including energy, railroad and retail. Buffett revealed previously that Abel's taken on most of the responsibilities at Berkshire. Still, some questions remain as to who will be helping allocate capital at Berkshire, and the roles of Buffett's investing managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, who is also the CEO of Geico.

But one of the biggest factors to his success has nothing to do with picking the right companies. \"His skill is investing, but his secret is time,\" Morgan Housel wrote in the bestselling business book, \"The Psychology of Money.\" \"That's how compounding works,\" Housel wrote. To that point, 99% of Buffett's net worth was accumulated after he was 65 years old, Housel said during a 2022 interview with CNBC. \"If Buffett retired at age 65, you would have never heard of him,\" Housel said. Today, Buffett's total net worth is estimated at $132 billion. That's up substantially from the $84.5 billion net worth Buffett had at the time Housel's book was published in 2020. Most of that wealth came in Buffett's later years, Housel wrote, with $84.2 billion after he turned 50 and $81.5 billion after he turned 65. Compound interest accumulates not only on the initial amount invested, but also to the interest in previous periods. Buffett has compared it to a snowball rolling down a hill. By the time it gets to the bottom, it is much larger. \"The trick is to have a very long hill, which means starting very young or living … to be very old,\" Buffett said. Everyday investors can easily put the power of compound interest to work. \"Start early — as young as you can — and even if it's just small amounts, just keep doing it,\" said David Rea, president of Salem Investment Counselors in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Buffett himself got an early start, making his first stock purchase at age 11. But after selling the three shares of Cities Service, he saw the stock surge, which served as an early lesson that it's hard to predict when to buy a stock and when to sell it. More from Personal Finance:Advice about 401(k) rollovers is poised for a big change. Here's whyIRS free filing pilot processed more than 140,000 returns, commissioner saysHere's why new home sales inch higher despite 7% mortgage rates People tend to get excited when the market is going up, which prompts them to buy, noted Bradley Klontz, a certified financial planner and behavioral finance expert with Your Mental Wealth Advisors. Then when markets drop, they tend to get scared and sell, which is the opposite of what they should be doing, said Klontz, who is also a member of the CNBC FA Council. The S&P 500 has returned more than 10% per year on average over the past 100 years, Klontz noted. Yet investors who try to time the market won't reap the full benefit of those gains if they're moving in and out of their investments. Individuals are not necessarily to blame; survival instincts will prompt you to follow the crowd. \"We're wired to do it,\" Klontz said. We're also wired to consume today rather than prioritize future gratification. To combat that, it helps to have a specific vision for why you're investing — the freedom you hope to achieve, the car you want to drive and the emotional satisfaction that life will bring you, Klontz said. When you clearly have that goal in mind, take action and set up automated movements of your money, say from your paycheck to your 401(k) plan, he recommended. Like Buffett, individuals will also reap the most rewards if they start young. \"It's actually pretty easy to become a millionaire if you're starting early,\" Klontz said. But the longer you wait, the harder it is to catch up. For example, the $5 a day you would need to accumulate $1 million when you're just starting out may turn into $500 a month at age 30, he said. The good news is that an investment strategy does not need to be complicated. Buffett himself has recommended individuals keep it simple with a low-cost S&P 500 index fund. \"If you buy an S&P 500, index fund, week in and week out, you will compound to a large amount of money,\" Rea said. Investors can also take other cues from Buffett — don't panic; buy American; and keep investing through good and bad, Rea said. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

    "published_at": "2024-05-03T11:32:19Z",
    "content": "According to an article by Gregory Zuckerman for The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Warren Buffett, known for his cautious investment style, made a surprising pivot in 2016 when Berkshire Hathaway began accumulating shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). Historically, Buffett and his partner Charlie Munger had steered clear of tech stocks, with Munger even describing Apple as “un-Berkshirelike” in a 2013 Reuters interview. This deviation from their typical investment philosophy marked a significant turn, especially given Buffett’s earlier skepticism about the tech giant’s stock potential. Per the WSJ report, Buffett’s initial reluctance was transformed as he began to view Apple more as a consumer goods company with considerable pricing power due to strong brand loyalty. This shift in perception, catalyzed by high customer retention rates and the addictive quality of Apple products, prompted a large-scale investment in the company. Starting with an initial purchase of nearly 10 million shares in 2016, Berkshire Hathaway substantially increased its Apple stake over the next two years, investing approximately $36 billion. By the end of 2018, Apple constituted about a quarter of Berkshire’s investment portfolio, making it one of Buffett’s most significant single investments. The Wall Street Journal reports that this investment has been immensely profitable for Berkshire, with its Apple stake now valued at about $157 billion, despite recent declines in Apple’s stock price.  Berkshire Hathaway has realized approximately $120 billion in gains, a testament to the extraordinary success of this investment, which outperformed the S&P 500 by a significant margin during the same period. However, current circumstances have introduced new challenges for Apple, as highlighted by the WSJ. The tech giant faces regulatory scrutiny, slowing growth in China, and increasing competition in the tech industry, particularly in artificial intelligence. These factors contribute to the heightened risk profile of Apple’s stock, which has already seen a 6.79% drop this year. As Warren Buffett contemplates the future leadership of Berkshire Hathaway, the management of this enormous stake in Apple remains a critical issue. Despite some reduction in their holdings, Berkshire still holds a substantial portion of Apple shares. The decision to maintain such a large investment in Apple reflects Buffett’s confidence in the long-term value of the company, despite its current challenges and the broader tech industry’s dynamic nature. Yesterday, Apple announced financial results for its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended March 30, 2024). Apple announced an all-time high revenue of $90.8 billion. According to Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, this outcome includes a revenue record in the company’s Services segment. The quarter was notably marked by the launch of the Apple Vision Pro, showcasing the extensive possibilities of spatial computing. Looking ahead, Apple anticipates unveiling another major product next week (rumored to be a new iPad Pro), with further excitement building towards the Worldwide Developers Conference scheduled for the following month. Cook emphasized the company’s commitment to excellence in product and service offerings, aligning with Apple’s foundational values. Apple said its sustained success is reflected in unprecedented levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, contributing to a record-high active installed base across all product categories and geographic areas. This performance has led to a new earnings per share (EPS) record for the March quarter, as stated by Apple’s CFO, Luca Maestri.  The board has approved an increase in the quarterly dividend for the twelfth consecutive year, now at $0.25 per share, marking a 4 percent increase. This dividend is set to be distributed on May 16, 2024, to shareholders recorded by the close of business on May 13, 2024. Additionally, the board has authorized a substantial new share repurchase program, committing an additional $110 billion to buy back Apple’s common stock. Apple says these decisions underscore the board’s confidence in the continued value and future growth potential of Apple, aiming to further reward its shareholders amidst ongoing financial success. In pre-market trading, AAPL is currently (as of 11:25 a.m. UTC on May 3) at $183.79, up $10.76 (6.22%). Since hardware sales were disappointing, the only explanation for the pop in the share price is the $110 billion share buyback program. According to a report by CNBC, “overall sales fell 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% year over year during the quarter, which Apple attributed to a tough comparison versus last year.”   If Apple does not do anything impressive with AI or find a way to increase its sales growth at some point this year, it is possible that Buffett’s patience with Apple will run out.

    "content": " Dolar: $938,88 | UF: $37.286,78 Indicadores Papel Digital Registro newsletter  papel digital Compartir La última sesión de la semana comienza con Apple liderando las alzas. Las acciones de Apple saltaron hasta 6% tras reportar sus resultados del primer trimestre. A medida que pasan las horas, ha recortado su avance, pero sigue impulsando al Nasdaq y al S&P500, junto a acciones tecnológicas en Asia. La empresa reportó una caída en la venta de sus iPhones y una desaceleración de su negocio en China. Sin embargo Apple, las cifras fueron menos dramáticas a las que esperaba el mercado. No sólo eso, Apple se mostró optimista para su negocio para lo que queda del año. El factor detrás del alza de los papeles, sin embargo, es el anuncio de un plan de recompra de acciones por US$ 110.000 millones y un dividendo de 4%.  El impulso de Apple se extiende a otras acciones tecnológicas en Asia y Europa. En Asia, el Hang Seng extiende su rally con un alza por 1,48%. En Europa, los bancos francceses también capturan titulares. Société Générale y Crédit Agricole ven subir sus acciones 3% y 4%, respectivamente, tras reportar cifras por encima de lo esperado para el primer trimestre gracias al buen desempeño de sus bancas de inversión. La sesión en general mantiene un sesgo al alza, mientras los inversionistas esperan nuevos datos de EEUU. Se espera que el reporte laboral de abril muestre una moderación en contrataciones no agrícolas, con una creación de 243.000 empleos tras los sorpresivos 303.000 registrados en marzo. Muy importante, analistas también querrán ver una desaceleración en el ingreso medio por hora. Una expansión del índice PMI de servicios, que también se publica hoy, podría fortalecer la idea de una economía estadounidense que no permite espacios para un recorte de tasas de parte de la Fed. Hay que poner atención a lo que parece perfilarse como una batalla por Anglo American. Las acciones de la mineras suben 3,16%, tras reportes de que Glencore estaría estudiando presentar una oferta. Mientras, todavía se espera que BHP defina si mejorará su oferta para quedarse con los activos, principalmente de cobre, de Anglo.

    "description": "The Minnesota-based franchisor is seeing sales and profits steadily climb as its international ice cream ambition grows.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-03T10:13:00Z",
    "content": "It's getting easier to track down a Blizzard in Beijing. Dairy Queen opened 450 new locations around the world last year — and 300 of them were in China. \"China continues to be our fastest-growing market,\" said Troy Bader, CEO of Bloomington-based International Dairy Queen. \"International plays a really, really important part of our future.\" Dairy Queen restaurants reported $6.4 billion in sales last year. Since 2019, sales are up 36%, Bader said, and global growth played a big role in that. More than a third of Dairy Queen's nearly 7,500 locations are now located outside the U.S. and Canada. \"Our international growth is where we're seeing our greatest opportunities — our presence isn't as mature,\" Bader said. China is a huge market for American fast-food chains, where KFC and McDonald's are the dominant players. However, local brands are starting to catch up. \"Initially considered a luxury item for a select few, fast food has become increasingly accessible and affordable for a broader segment of Chinese consumers as the economy has grown and disposable incomes have risen,\" according to a report by Dezan Shira & Associates, a foreign direct investment consultancy, which pegs the Chinese fast-food market at more than $500 billion. Dairy Queen is focusing on Southeast Asia broadly; the brand already has about 500 locations in Thailand and a presence in other nearby countries like Vietnam and the Philippines. \"We have supply chains established, we have brand recognition,\" Bader said. \"We are looking at new markets, but that is one area we continue to focus on.\" Mexico has also taken to soft serve, where there are nearly 325 Dairy Queen locations. The chain operates in 20 countries. Internationally, Dairy Queen is known more for its ice cream treats than its food, though the emphasis is shifting toward the Grill & Chill model more common in the U.S. \"We are still the undisputed treat leader and plan to be,\" Bader said. \"But we also are a very balanced food and treat player.\" Domestically, Dairy Queen is pushing even harder to be known for its hot eats as well as its cool treats. \"We talk about our chicken strips being Blizzard-good,\" Bader said, and a new burger lineup released in 2022 is still performing well. International Dairy Queen had $248 million in revenue last year and a $93 million profit, according to franchise disclosure documents, both improvements from the year before. The company earns royalties paid by franchisees and boasts a roughly 50% operating margin. Like other restaurants, Dairy Queen franchisees have had to increase prices in recent years to deal with higher wages and ingredient costs. Bader said the specific increases are up to individual store owners, though the company provides guidance, especially for maintaining the $7 meal and two-for-$5 promotions. \"We still want to make sure we have everyday value available for our fans,\" Bader said. Dairy Queen, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, will be serving up Dilly Bars at the multinational conglomerate's famed annual meeting this weekend in Omaha. Though a small part of Warren Buffett's business empire since 1998, the 84-year-old ice cream company is well-loved by shareholders, Bader said. \"Dairy Queen is one of their favorites because it has a special place in many people's lives and their hearts.\"  Brooks Johnson is a business reporter covering Minnesota’s food industry, 3M and manufacturing trends. © 2024 StarTribune.

    "description": "Mercedes macht es, Siemens, Apple und Berkshire Hathaway auch: Aktienrückkäufe nehmen zu. Welche Ziele die Unternehmen dabei verfolgen - und was die Folgen für Anleger sind. Von Antje Erhard.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-03T09:47:47Z",
    "content": "Stand: 03.05.2024 13:08 Uhr \nMercedes macht es, Siemens, Apple und Berkshire Hathaway auch: Aktienrückkäufe nehmen zu. Welche Ziele die Unternehmen dabei verfolgen - und was die Folgen für Anleger sind.\n \nImmer mehr Unternehmer nehmen Geld in die Hand, um ihre eigenen Aktien aufzukaufen. Das nennt man an der Börse Aktienrückkauf. Unternehmen haben dafür verschiedene Möglichkeiten: Zum einen der Weg über die Börsen. Wie jeder Marktteilnehmer können Unternehmen dort Aktien kaufen oder verkaufen, auch ihre eigenen. Zum anderen können sie ihren Aktionären ein öffentliches Angebot zum Kauf unterbreiten mit fester Anzahl und festem Preis. \nDie Hauptversammlung muss dem Vorstand dazu das \"Go\" geben. Dazu werden Umfang und Zeitraum des Rückkaufes genau festgelegt. Gesetzlich geregelt ist von vornherein, dass Unternehmen nur maximal zehn Prozent des Grundkapitals zurückerwerben dürfen. \nDie zurückgekauften Aktien kann ein Unternehmen aus dem Verkehr ziehen, also löschen. Eine andere Möglichkeit ist, sie an die Belegschaft auszugeben als eine Art Bonus. Manche Unternehmen nutzen das durchaus zur Motivation. \nAber warum kaufen Unternehmen ihre eigenen Aktien - ein Aktienrückkauf kostet schließlich Geld? Geld, das für Investitionen oder Schuldentilgung dann nicht mehr zur Verfügung steht? \nEs geschehe dann, \"wenn Unternehmen mehr Chancen darin sehen, ins eigene Unternehmen zu investieren, statt weiter in das operative Geschäft oder am Kapitalmarkt anzulegen\", sagt Börsenexperte Andreas Lipkow. Das sei eine gut abzuwägende unternehmerische Entscheidung. \"Und natürlich gibt man den Aktionären mehr Wert.\" \nKurz gesagt: Diese Programme hübschen den Kurs auf - auf legale Art: Wenn eine größere Anzahl Aktien vom Markt verschwindet und die Zahl der handelbaren Aktien sinkt, dann wird das Angebot knapper. Gewinne und Dividenden verteilen sich dann auf weniger Aktien. Das Ergebnis: Der Gewinn pro Aktie steigt, obwohl das Unternehmen nicht mehr verdient haben muss. Der Aktienkurs legt meistens zu. \n08.08.2022\n Konzerne werden in diesem Jahr möglicherweise so viele eigene Aktien erwerben wie noch nie.\n                                    mehr\n \nAktien-Rückkäufe können aber ein Unternehmen auch vor einer Übernahme schützen. Will ein Unternehmen nicht übernommen werden, kann es mit Aktien-Rückkäufen gegenhalten. Dann wird es für den kaufwilligen Konkurrenten schwerer, denn weniger Aktien bedeuten: höhere Preise. \nVor allem die Kurssteigerungen machen sich immer mehr Unternehmen auch hierzulande zunutze: Siemens, SAP und Mercedes sind die größten Rückkäufer. In Deutschland wollen die DAX-Unternehmen in diesem Jahr insgesamt rund 16 Milliarden Euro in Rückkäufe ihrer Aktien stecken, analysierte die Commerzbank kürzlich. Das wäre ein Rekordwert. \nAktionäre profitieren davon kurz- wie langfristig. Schon die Ankündigung eines solchen Programms lässt meistens den Aktienkurs zulegen. Langfristig belegt eine Auswertung des Vermögensverwalters HQ Trust, dass Aktien-Rückkäufe für die Aktionäre ein Vorteil sein können. \n15.04.2024\n Die Gewinne der im Leitindex DAX gelisteten Konzerne sinken, aber die Dividenden steigen auf ein Rekordhoch.\n                                    mehr\n \nDazu analysierte HQ Trust die Entwicklung des weltweit investierenden MSCI All Country World-Index über zehn Jahre: Im Durchschnitt stiegen die nordamerikanischen Aktien im Index in dem Zeitraum jährlich um 13,7 Prozent. 3,5 Prozentpunkte gehen nach Einschätzung von HQ Trust auf das Konto der Rückkäufe - in Europa sogar noch mehr: Obwohl die Kurse im Schnitt 6,8 Prozent jährlich gestiegen waren, haben die Rückkäufe in Europa 26,8 Prozent ausgemacht. \nIn den USA sind Rückkäufe seit Jahren gängige Praxis. Beispiel Apple: Der iPhone-Hersteller kündigte in dieser Woche an, Aktien für 110 Milliarden US-Dollar zu kaufen. Zum Vergleich: Im vergangenen Jahr hatte er für 78 Milliarden US-Dollar eigene Anteile vom Markt genommen, 2022 im Volumen von 90 Milliarden - und das in Zeiten, in denen die iPhone-Nachfrage sinkt und der wichtige chinesische Markt schwieriger geworden ist. Auch Groß-Investor Warren Buffett steckt immer wieder Milliarden in eigene Aktien. \n17.02.2021\n Warren Buffett hat in großem Stil Anteile an Telekomfirmen und dem Ölkonzern Chevron gekauft.\n                                    mehr\n \nNicht nur wenn es geschäftlich schwieriger läuft - grundsätzlich gibt es an Aktien-Rückkäufen Kritik: Einfallslos sei es, eigene Aktien zurückzukaufen; nur den Aktionären verpflichtet. Investitionen in das Geschäft wären sinnvoller. In schwierigen Zeiten halte man besser sein Geld zusammen. \nWährend in Deutschland die Rückkauf-Mentalität in den letzten Jahren zunimmt, rudern die USA aktuell etwas zurück. Im vergangenen Jahr haben US-Unternehmen für rund 773 Milliarden Dollar eigene Aktien gekauft. Allerdings waren das 17 Prozent weniger als im Vorjahr, das ergab eine Studie des Vermögensverwalters Janus Henderson. \n\nhintergrund\n\n12.04.2024\n Der \"Weltindex\" MSCI World ist bei vielen Fondssparern auch in Deutschland beliebt. Doch wie riskant ist er?\n                                    mehr\n \nDie Investmentbank Goldman Sachs prognostiziert allerdings für das kommende Jahr, dass die Rückkäufe einen Rekord erreichen, weil vor allem die Technologie-Unternehmen sich an den Programmen beteiligen: \"Das Gewinnwachstum ist der wichtigste Antrieb für Aktienrückkäufe\", erklärte Goldman Sachs im März in einer Studie und untermauerte das mit Zahlen: Erstmals soll die Billionen-Dollar-Grenze für Aktienrückkäufe der Unternehmen des S&P 500 Aktienindex fallen. \nNeben den Aussichten auf steigende Gewinne könnten die möglicherweise sinkenden Zinsen Unternehmen animieren, mehr Geld für Rückkäufe auszugeben.

    "content": "Adolfo Reséndiz   Periodista por la Escuela de Periodismo Carlos Septién García. Técnico mecánico automotriz CEDVA. Me gusta el rap, comer asado argentino y los fines de semana largos. Tesla ha vuelto a tomar el centro del escenario en el mundo de los autos eléctricos, recuperando su posición como líder mundial en ventas después de superar a su competidor chino BYD en el primer trimestre de 2024. Con 386,810 vehículos eléctricos vendidos en los primeros tres meses del año, Tesla ha logrado un hito significativo a pesar de una disminución del 20.2% respecto al último trimestre de 2023 y del 8.5% en comparación con el mismo trimestre del año pasado. BYD, por su parte, reportó ventas de 300,114 vehículos eléctricos en el mismo período, un aumento del 13.4% respecto al año anterior, pero muy por debajo de su récord de 526,409 unidades en el último trimestre de 2023. La compañía, respaldada por Berkshire Hathaway del veterano inversor estadounidense Warren Buffett, ha optado por reducir los precios de algunos de sus últimos modelos en un intento por atraer compradores más cautelosos frente a artículos costosos como los automóviles. Además, para contrarrestar la disminución de la demanda en China, BYD ha estado explorando nuevas oportunidades de expansión en otros mercados según informa la BBC. La caída en las ventas tanto de Tesla como de BYD se atribuye a una competencia creciente y a una demanda más débil en todo el mundo, especialmente en China. A esto se suma la eliminación de las ayudas públicas a la compra de vehículos eléctricos en Alemania o Noruega y la preferencia de los consumidores por los modelos híbridos. A pesar de estos desafíos, Elon Musk, CEO de Tesla, se mantiene optimista sobre el futuro de la compañía, destacando el potencial de crecimiento en el mercado de vehículos eléctricos y anunciando planes para acelerar el lanzamiento de nuevos modelos, incluido un vehículo más asequible y un robotaxi. La reciente visita de Musk a China y la eliminación de las restricciones a los autos de Tesla para cumplir con los requisitos de seguridad de datos del país son señales alentadoras para la compañía, que espera expandir su presencia en el mercado automotriz más grande del mundo. Aunque Tesla enfrenta desafíos por delante, como la competencia feroz y la necesidad de mantener la innovación, su capacidad para recuperar el trono mundial de los autos eléctricos demuestra su resiliencia y su posición como líder en la industria automotriz del futuro.

    "content": "Everyone knows Warren Buffett ‘s successor won’t be able to match the legendary investor, but Berkshire Hathaway ‘s board remains confident Greg Abel is the right guy to one day lead the conglomerate into the future. Longtime Berkshire board member Ron Olson told investors gathered Thursday at a conference two days ahead of the company’s annual shareholders meeting that Abel understands all the fundamental principles that guided Buffett, like letting Berkshire’s companies largely run themselves. And Abel will be committed to running Berkshire in a conservative way that will protect the company that’s known for it financial strength, he said. “Greg is not somebody who is going to be as likely to create the kind of following in the press that I think Warren has had,” Olson said. “On the other hand. I have every reason to believe that he will run the companies that we have the responsibility for in the same way that Warren ran them.” Olson said he’s confident business owners will still be willing to sell their companies to Berkshire once the Canadian utility executive takes over after the 93-year-old Buffett is gone. Olson said he doesn’t think last year’s public legal fight with the billionaire Haslam family over how much Berkshire would ultimately pay for the last 20% of the Pilot truck stop chain the family agreed to sell to Buffett will be a deterrent to future deals either. Both the Haslams and Berkshire accused each other of trying to manipulate Pilot’s earnings to affect the final $2.6 billion price. Business owners considering selling can see all the positive and respectful relationships Berkshire has with its dozens of other subsidiaries on display in the 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall adjoining the arena where Saturday’s meeting will be held, Olson said. In fact the legal battle gave Olson, who is a partner at Berkshire’s primary law firm, the chance to work closely with Abel, giving him even more confidence in the board’s chosen successor. “I could tell you that his preparation and thinking was impressive. He is strategic in his thinking. And he is decisive in his judgement,” Olson said. Plus, Berkshire is sitting on more than $167 billion cash, so it has ample resources to do deals and, Olson said, “people generally like to be paid in cash.” Abel, who keeps a low profile and doesn’t typically grant interviews, will be answering questions alongside Buffett for hours Saturday, trying to help fill the role Buffett’s longtime partner Charlie Munger held for decades before he died last fall. Abel has been overseeing all of Berkshire’s varied non-insurance businesses for several years while another vice chairman, Ajit Jain, oversees the insurance businesses, including Geico and General Reinsurance. Olson said Abel is a numbers guy who can dissect a business’ balance sheet as quickly and well as Buffett, and he’s also a great listener that people like to work with. But, Olson said, “Greg is not going to be as entertaining as Warren and Charlie have been through the years.” So Munger’s absence will be felt acutely on Saturday by all the thousands of people attending the meeting. There simply is no way to replace the expertise, advice and friendship Munger offered to Buffett for more than six decades. Professor Lawrence Cunningham, who has written several books about Berkshire, said he thinks even with the profound loss of Munger the company he helped build will endure. “The chair is empty. There’s no way to fill it. But I’m also confident that Warren — and especially Greg and Ajit — will carry on the torch,” Cunningham said. Berkshire has been grappling with succession questions for decades, but Cunningham said he thinks Buffett and Munger built an organization bigger than themselves that will endure. Olson said Berkshire’s board knows there just isn’t another Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger out there to replace those two men. After Buffett dies, Berkshire will face pressure as the shareholder base evolves to include more index and activist investors. One of the things investors may demand is that Berkshire change its longstanding policy and start paying a dividend if it can’t find a good use for all that cash. Olson said the board hasn’t ruled out paying a dividend at some point in the future, but it also hasn’t seriously considering approving one now with Buffett still at the helm. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

    "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\tBy Dade Hayes  Business Editor \nWarren Buffett says he has sold all of his shares in Paramount Global at a significant loss. \n\tSpeaking at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway, his company, today in Omaha, NE, the billionaire investor took full ownership of the bad call. Despite speculation to the contrary, he said, “It was 100% my decision” to invest in Paramount in 2022. “We sold it all and we lost quite a bit of money. That happens in this business.” (Watch a clip of him above.) \n\tAs of the end of 2023, Berkshire owned 63.3 million Class B, or non-voting shares, which had a value of about $800 million at the time. The stake, which represented about 10.1% of the company’s equity, helped boost the stock when Buffett initially invested in 2022. He then went on to make public comments criticizing the companies pursuing Netflix in subscription streaming, a cohort that includes Paramount, given the economics of the emerging sector. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tExecutives\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParamount Unveils Bob Bakish Exit Terms, Names Chris McCarthy 'Interim Principal Executive' For SEC Purposes\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNews\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn Epic Week For Paramount Global, Company Extends Carriage Talks With Charter\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Buffett has made plenty of missteps over his decades of investing. Owning Paramount stock, Buffett mused, “made me think even further … harder, even, about the whole question of what people do with their leisure time and what the governing principles are of running an entertainment business of any sort.” He dryly added, “I think I’m smarter than I was a year or two years ago. But I also think I’m poorer because I acquired the knowledge in the manner I did. \n\n \n\tClass B shareholders in Paramount have recently been up in arms about the company’s merger negotiations with Skydance Media due to fears of dilution. Shari Redstone controls almost 80% of the voting, or Class A, shares in the company and had favored a two-step, all-stock deal with Skydance. An exclusive negotiating window between the companies expired at midnight Friday and a special committee of the board of directors met today to consider an alternative, all-cash merger proposal from Sony Pictures Entertainment and private equity giant Apollo. That deal has a preliminary pricetag of $26 billion and would likely see all shareholders paid a premium. \n\tWall Street has generally approved of the Sony/Apollo deal, but Redstone has been more reluctant to embrace it because it would likely entail the breakup of the company and the combination of Paramount’s film studio with Sony’s. Redstone’s father, Sumner Redstone, regarded Paramount Pictures, which he acquired after a fierce battle with Barry Diller, as the centerpiece of his media empire.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy.

    "content": "Shareholder proposals are usually uneventful at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting, but Warren Buffett and the company are now facing a lawsuit over the way one presenter was treated last year OMAHA, Neb. -- Shareholder proposals are usually uneventful at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting. But Warren Buffett and the company are now facing a lawsuit over the way one presenter was treated last year. Peter Flaherty with the National Legal and Policy Center came back with another proposal this year on a different subject even after he was cut off in the middle of his presentation last year and arrested for trespassing. The charges were later dropped, but Flaherty decided to sue because of the way he was treated to stand up for any shareholder who wants to bring a proposal. He said he had never had trouble at dozens of meetings he has presented at since 2005, including Berkshire’s 2022 meeting. “I’ve never been interrupted while making a shareholder presentation. I’ve never had my mic cut, and I’ve never been removed from a meeting room. And I’ve certainly never been arrested,” Flaherty said, “Those things were unprecedented for me.” The issue last year was that Flaherty questioned the character of one of Buffett's best friends and a former Berkshire board member, Bill Gates. Flaherty suggested that Buffett's close association with Gates could hurt Berkshire's reputation because of reports that Gates had been associated with Jeffrey Epstein before he was arrested for sex trafficking. So he was proposing that Berkshire give someone else Buffett's chairman title while leaving him as CEO. Buffett has donated billions to Gates’ foundation over the years and plans to give him the bulk of his fortune to distribute. Berkshire didn't immediately respond to the federal lawsuit that was filed Friday, and it wasn't mentioned during Saturday's meeting. Berkshire officials didn't even address any of the proposals during the meeting — instead they relied on their statements of opposition that were filed in the official meeting proxy. Buffett stayed silent during the business meeting after spending all day Saturday answering shareholder questions at the main part of the shareholder meeting. He let his eventual successor Vice Chairman Greg Abel take the lead. He only reminded the presenters of all six proposals to keep their comments related to the proposals. Flaherty’s proposal was one of six rejected at Berkshire’s meeting this year. They were all opposed by the board, and Buffett still controls roughly one-third of the vote so anything he opposes is almost certain to fail. None of the proposals received more than 85,000 votes. Flaherty’s proposal only drew 6,150 votes while getting 443,544 votes against it. Some of the other proposals rejected Saturday included ones to require Berkshire to create reports on climate change risks and diversity and inclusion efforts at the massive conglomerate. Another proposal would have required Berkshire to create a board committee focused on railroad safety. The safety chief for the SMART-TD rail union that represents conductors and other rail workers, Jared Cassity, said that if BNSF wants to argue that safety is the railroad's top priority, Berkshire's board should focus on it and review staffing and operational practices to help prevent derailments like the disastrous one Norfolk Southern had last year in East Palestine, Ohio. “Railroad safety requires effective board oversight,” Cassity said. Berkshire argued that BNSF is already focused on improving safety and doesn't need more oversight. With regard to the other proposals, Berkshire officials argued that such reports would be cumbersome because of the decentralized way the company is run and unnecessary. Plus, some of its subsidiaries like its massive utility unit already produce reports on greenhouse gas emissions, Berkshire said. This year, Flaherty was allowed to make his case that Berkshire should produce a report on the risks of doing business in China, before the proposal was summarily rejected. “China poses unique risks for Berkshire Hathaway,” Flaherty said, arguing that the company's existing disclosures about subsidiaries like Fruit of the Loom that have factories in China are inadequate. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

And when it came to the conglomerate’s stake in Paramount Global, that cost Berkshire some money. During a question-and-answer session at Berkshire’s annual shareholder conference on Saturday, Buffett revealed that the company dumped all of its remaining shares of Paramount, the parent company of CBS, MTV, and Paramount Pictures. And it did so at a loss. As of Dec. 31, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire held 63 million shares of Paramount valued at  $816 million, according to a February Securities and Exchange Commission filing.  “I was 100% responsible for the Paramount decision,” Buffett said. “It was 100% my decision, and we’ve sold it all and we lost quite a bit of money.” Buffett said Berkshire’s involvement with Paramount made him think deeper about what people do with their leisure time and “what the governing principles are of running an entertainment business of any sort,” from sports to movies. “I think I’m smarter now than I was a couple years ago, but I also think I’m poorer,” he added. Berkshire first acquired a nonvoting stake of Paramount class B shares in early 2022. Paramount stock has fallen almost 13% year-to-date, and more than 21% year-over-year. The company has been the target of several potential takeover bids as its business struggles. On Friday, much-criticized merger talks between Paramount and SkyDance Media, the film production company led by David Ellison, ended after Paramount decided not to extend negotiations. Skydance — the film company behind big-name movies like Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One — had proposed to pay more than $2 billion for National Amusements, Paramount’s parent company, and to have Ellison lead the newly-formed company. The end of merger talks with Skydace came just after Sony Pictures and Apollo Global Management made a $26 billion all-cash offer to buy Paramount. In another shakeup last Monday, Paramount CEO Bob Bakish announced that he would step down from the role.

With regard to the other proposals, Berkshire officials argued that such reports would be cumbersome because of the decentralized way the company is run and unnecessary. Plus, some of its subsidiaries like its massive utility unit already produce reports on greenhouse gas emissions, Berkshire said. This year, Flaherty was allowed to make his case that Berkshire should produce a report on the risks of doing business in China, before the proposal was summarily rejected. “China poses unique risks for Berkshire Hathaway,” Flaherty said, arguing that the company's existing disclosures about subsidiaries like Fruit of the Loom that have factories in China are inadequate.

    "content": "“It was 100% my decision,” the CEO said during the company’s annual meeting on Saturday As Paramount comes off a rocky week in which the company lost its CEO and its exclusive merger talks window with Skydance came to an end without a deal, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett says his company has now sold its entire stake in Paramount. Berkshire Hathaway had previously sold a third of its stock in Paramount during the fourth quarter of last year. “We sold it all, and we lost quite a bit of money, that happens in this business too,” Buffett said on Saturday at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. He added that he was “100% responsible” for the Paramount decision — both buying in and getting out. According to the company’s latest available filings, Berkshire owned 63.3 million shares of Paramount Global at the end of 2023. The company disclosed a $2.6 billion stake in Paramount in 2022 and picked up even more shares after that, but now they’re out. “Owning Paramount made me think even deeper, but I certainly looked harder about the whole question of what people do with their leisure time and what the governing principles are of running an entertainment business of any sort, whether it’s sports or movies or whatever it might be,” Buffett said at the meeting. “I think I’m smarter now than I was a couple years ago, but I also think I’m poorer because I acquired the knowledge in the matter I did.” On Friday, after a month of exclusive talks between Paramount and Skydance, their negotiation window expired without a deal, signaling one is unlikely to happen. David Ellison’s Skydance submitted a revised offer earlier this week in an effort to assuage concerns that the deal benefits non-executive chairwoman Shari Redstone over other investors. Notable investors have warned they could pursue litigation if the Skydance deal or any other bid does not adequately benefit shareholders. Ahead of the window closing and moments before the company reported its Q1 earnings, Paramount CEO Bob Bakish was ousted and replaced with a trio of executives to form an “Office of the CEO” — CBS CEO and president George Cheeks, Paramount Media Networks CEO and president Chris McCarthy and Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon CEO and president Brian Robbins. Sony Pictures Entertainment and Apollo Global Management have also submitted a non-binding, joint $26 billion all-cash offer for Paramount. That deal would see Sony take a majority stake and operational control, while Apollo would have a minority stake. But such a deal would likely face regulatory scrutiny due to limitations surrounding foreign ownership. For now, Paramount is going it alone.  Your email address will not be published.

Buffett disclosed the news during Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday.\n\n \n\t“We sold it all, and we lost quite a bit of money, that happens in this business too,” Buffett told the crowd, adding that he was the one who decided to buy into the company in the first place (there had been speculation that one of Buffett’s deputies may have initiated the trade). “I did it all by myself, folks.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParamount Expected to Part Ways With CEO Bob Bakish Amid Deal Talks\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'The Smurfs Movie' Sets Starry Cast to Join Rihanna; Dave Bautista, Eric Nam Board 'Airbender' Franchise\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tBerkshire surprised Wall Street when it disclosed a $2.6 billion stake in Paramount in May 2022. Later that year, it added even more shares, ultimately becoming the largest shareholder in the company (or at least its non-voting shares, with Shari Redstone and the Redstone family’s National Amusements controlling a majority of its voting shares). \n\tSince then, of course, Paramount has been on a stock downswing, as the exorbitant costs to compete in the streaming wars and a seemingly tepid M&A market, have put the company in a difficult financial position. Paramount also slashed its dividend last year so that it could invest in streaming.\n\n \n\tIn recent months the company has been embroiled in sale talks, with an exclusive negotiating window with a consortium led by David Ellison’s Skydance having just ended, and a new proposal from Apollo and Sony on the table. While the stock price had picked up slightly given the talks, it has been wobbly given the uncertainty over whether a deal would get done, and what would happen if it doesn’t. \n\tThe company also parted ways with its CEO, Bob Bakish, last week, replacing him with a trio of executives forming an “office of the CEO.” \n\tAt Berkshire’s shareholder meeting last year in Omaha, Buffett quipped that “it’s not good news when any company cuts its dividend dramatically,” and added comments that seemed skeptical of the streaming business. \n\t“You’ve got a bunch of companies that don’t want to quit. Who knows what pricing does under that?” Buffett said. \n\tAt Saturday’s meeting, Buffett said that the experience taught him, at 93 years old, a lesson. \n\t“Actually, owning Paramount made me think even deeper, but I certainly looked harder about the whole question of what people do with their leisure time and what the governing principles are of running an entertainment business of any sort, whether it’s sports or movies or whatever it might be,” Buffett said. “I think I’m smarter now than I was a couple years ago, but I also think I’m poorer because I acquired the knowledge in the manner I did.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tBerkshire disclosed in February that it began selling its stake in Paramount at the end of last year.

    "published_at": "2024-05-04T21:22:59Z",
    "content": " Related Stories Every year, tens of thousands of investors flock to Omaha — and many more tune in around the world – to watch Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett field questions from shareholders at his company's annual meeting. This year, as ever, Buffett shared his insights not only on the financial fundamentals behind Berkshire's many subsidiaries and portfolio companies, but also the path to a successful life. This year's entire 4-plus-hour affair is worth a watch, listen or read. But without getting into the nitty-gritty, here's two key pieces of advice Buffett shared on Saturday — one about money, and one about life. One shareholder asked Buffett about one of the most fundamental decisions any investor can make: when to buy or sell an investment. The description of the process he and longtime partner Charlie Munger employed offers tremendous insight to his investment philosophy. \"Charlie and I made decisions extremely fast, but in effect after years of thinking about the parameters that would enable us to make the quick decision when it presented itself,\" he said. He didn't make his sizable investment in Apple, he said, until he felt he had a full grasp of consumer behavior, an understanding he came to after owning several other consumer businesses, both successful and unsuccessful. After years of gathering intelligence on a particular subject, he said, \"there is something that comes along and ticks a whole bunch of observations that you've made and knowledge you have, and then crystallizes your thinking into action, big action in the case of Apple.\" The point for investors: Buffett doesn't buy any investment based on vibes or impulse. Only after he determined that the iPhone was \"maybe the greatest product of all time,\" did he buy. Meanwhile, he never worries about missing out on an investment if it involves a product or company that he hasn't devoted exhaustive research to. \"Charlie and I missed a lot of things … we never worried about missing something that we didn't understand,\" Buffett said. Shareholders frequently ask Buffett for his musings on a life well lived, but rarely are they quite as straightforward as one question asker this year: \"What advice would you like to share today that you believe everyone needs to hear?\" she asked. Buffett echoed guidance from Munger: Think about how you would like your obituary to read, and begin building a life that will get you there. Buffett noted that those living in present day America have as good a chance at accomplishing this as anyone in world history. \"You're entering the best world that's ever existed. And you want to find the people to share it with and the activities to participate in that fit you,\" he said. \"And if you get lucky like Charlie and I did you'll find things that interest you young. But if you don't find them right away you keep looking.\" That may require some trial and error, Buffett acknowledged. \"I always tell students, find a job that you would like to have if you didn't need a job. Sometimes you can find that very early, and sometimes you go through various experiences,\" he said. \"But don't forget what you're actually trying to do.\" Regardless of what tribulations you go through, keeping in mind how you'd like to eventually be remembered is the best way to help you achieve it, Buffett said. \"Expect some difficulties along the way, but if you're thinking that way, you're more likely to get there.\" Want to make extra money outside of your day job? Sign up for CNBC's new online course How to Earn Passive Income Online to learn about common passive income streams, tips to get started and real-life success stories.

Buffett opined that trimming the company's stake in Apple was in part due to tax reasons after the stock roared in 2023. \"It doesn't bother me in the least to write that check and I would really hope with all that America's done for all of you, it shouldn't bother you that we do it,\" Buffett said. \"And if I'm doing it at 21% this year and we're doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year.\" Buffett also noted he unloaded Berkshire's entire position in Paramount Global — and took full responsibility for the loss. \"It was 100% my decision, and we've sold it all and we lost quite a bit of money,\" Buffett said. The firm owned 63.3 million shares of Paramount at the end of 2023 after slashing the position by roughly one-third in the fourth quarter of last year. Here are some of the best quotes from Buffett on some of Berkshire's top holdings.  Buffett said Apple and Coca-Cola will remain premier holdings in Berkshire's portfolio. \"That's the story of why we own American Express, which is a wonderful business. We own Coca-Cola, which is a wonderful business,\" Buffett said. \"And we own Apple, which is an even better business, and we will own, unless something really extraordinary happens, we will own Apple and American Express and Coca-Cola.\" The \"Oracle of Omaha\" highlighted credit card firm American Express as another favorite, noting the company's growing position in the consumer credit sector. \"I can't really think of a company like American Express that has a position and a credit card that is extremely strong,\" Buffett said. \"It has strengthened dramatically over the last 20 years for a lot of reasons.\" Buffett credited longtime partner Charlie Munger, who died in November, for his call to buy both Chinese manufacturing company BYD and wholesale retailer Costco — but wished he took a larger stake in Costco. Berkshire no longer owns a position in Costco. \"Charlie, twice, pounded the table with me and said 'buy, buy, buy' and BYD was one of them and Costco was the other. We bought a certain amount of Costco and bought quite a bit of BYD, but looking back, he already wasn't as aggressive, but I should have been more aggressive in Costco,\" Buffett said. \"It wasn't fatal that we weren't but [Munger] was right big-time in both companies.\" Buffett told Berkshire investors on Saturday that the company's cash stake hoard could climb to $200 billion by the end of the current quarter. \"I don't mind at all under current conditions building the cash position. When I look at what's available in equity markets and the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive,\" the investor said. \"Our cash and Treasury bills were $182 billion at the quarter end, and I think it's a fair assumption that they'll probably be at about $200 billion at the end of this quarter.\" Got a confidential news tip?

    "content": "В первом квартале 2024 года Berkshire Hathaway Уоррена Баффета снова сократила инвестиции в Apple. Рыночная стоимость акций бигтеха в портфеле упала до $135,4 млрд, следует из формы 10-Q, содержащей данные за первый квартал 2024 года. По подсчетам CNBC, это соответствует примерно 790 млн акций, тогда как на конец четвертого квартала 2023 года их было 905,56 млн. Иными словами, пакет Apple, которым владеет конгломерат, в первом квартале сократился почти на 13%. Berkshire Hathaway избавляется от акций Apple второй квартал подряд. В четвертом квартале конгломерат продал чуть более 10 млн акций Apple, или около 1% пакета. С одной стороны есть мнение, что таким образом Баффет фиксирует прибыль. По итогам 2023 года котировки Apple выросли почти на 50%, эмитент стал одним из лидеров роста в технологическом секторе. С другой стороны, в этом году настроения в отношении Apple не столь оптимистичные — котировки компании с начала января упали на 4,75%. Несколько недель назад просадка была еще больше, но потери сократились после недавнего отчета за первый квартал и решения Apple провести обратный выкуп на $110 млрд — самый крупный за всю историю рынка США. Тем не менее, по итогам первого квартала бигтех зафиксировал снижение выручки и прибыли, при том что форвардное значение мультипликатора P/E превышает 27х. Всего на конец первого квартала около 75% инвестиционного портфеля Berkshire Hathaway занимали акции пяти компаний: Apple — рыночная стоимость пакета на конец марта составила $135,4 млрд;Bank of America — $39,2 млрд;American Express — $34,5 млрд;Coca-Cola — $24,5 млрд;Chevron — $19,4 млрд. Важным маркером состояния Berkshire Hathaway является операционная прибыль, поскольку помимо портфеля финансовых инвестиций конгломерат управляет производственными предприятиями, а также компаниями в сфере страхования, коммунальных услуг, энергетики и железнодорожных перевозок. По итогам первого квартала 2024 года этот показатель вырос год к году на 39%, до $11,22 млрд. Это абсолютный рекорд в истории Berkshire, предыдущий был поставлен в третьем квартале 2023 года ($10,76 млрд). Основную часть прироста этого показателя принесли компании, связанные со страхованием. Прибыль этого сегмента подскочила почти в три раза — с $911 млн до $2,6 млрд. Как отмечает Bloomberg, это произошло благодаря улучшению результатов автостраховщика Geico, меньшему количеству катастроф и росту дохода от инвестиций в страхование. Также агентство обратило внимание на предупреждение Баффета, сделанное им год назад, о том, что прибыль большей части подразделений Berkshire упадет в 2023 году из-за того, что «невероятный период» для экономики США подходит к концу. Эти слова были сказаны на годовом собрании акционеров Berkshire Hathaway. Баффет тогда спрогнозировал замедление темпов роста своих компаний на фоне потрясений в банковском секторе США, а также ускорения инфляции и повышения ставок в экономике. Чистая прибыль, которая складывается из операционной прибыли и прибыли по сделкам на фондовом рынке, в первом квартале составила $12,7 млрд против $35,5 млрд годом ранее (-64,2% год к году). Впрочем, Баффет не раз заявлял, что «анализ прибылей или убытков, полученных от инвестиционной деятельности в отдельно взятом квартале, обычно не имеет смысла». Стандарты финансовой отчетности обязывают раскрывать в том числе нереализованные убытки или прибыли от таких сделок. В первом квартале Berkshire Hathaway обновила еще один рекорд — размер денежной подушки на балансе. На конец квартала объем свободного кеша достиг $189 млрд. Предыдущий рекорд был установлен в четвертом квартале 2023 года на уровне $167,64 млрд. В феврале этого года Баффет посетовал на отсутствие значимых сделок, которые позволили бы Berkshire Hathaway добиться «ошеломительных результатов», отмечает Bloomberg. В связи с этим Berkshire Hathway активно проводит обратный выкуп своих акций. В первом квартале этого года конгломерат потратил на эти цели $2,6 млрд. В субботу, 4 мая, также пройдет годовое общее собрание акционеров Berkshire Hathaway в Омахе. Главная интрига заключается в том, раскроет ли Баффет название загадочного бизнеса, в который Berkshire Hathway инвестировала в прошлом году. В третьем и четвертом квартале Berkshire Hathaway попросила у Комиссии по ценным бумагам и биржам США (SEC) разрешения не раскрывать информацию об одном или нескольких активах в своем портфеле в целях конфиденциальности. Пока неизвестно, какая конкретно компания заинтересовала Баффета, но аналитики предполагают, что «оракул из Омахи» сделал крупную ставку на финансовый сектор. Конгломерат относительно редко обращается в регулятору с просьбой не раскрывать свои инвестиции. В предыдущий раз так было с Chevron и Verizon, акции которых Berkshire тайно скупала в 2020 году. Среди других ожидаемых тем — вопрос управления и преемственности. «Откровенно говоря, вопрос преемственности является главным вопросом для большинства инвесторов. И это своего рода слон в комнате, учитывая возраст Уоррена Баффета и смерть Чарли Мангера», — отметила старший вице-президент CFRA Research Кэти Зайферт, Не считая пандемии коронавируса, это будет первое собрание Berkshire Hathaway, которое пройдет без Чарли Мангера. Многолетний соратник Уоррена Баффета скончался в ноябре 2023 года в возрасте 99 лет. Мангер и Баффет познакомились в 1959 году, к Berkshire Hathaway будущий вице-председатель компании присоединился в 1978-ом."

O evento aconteceu neste sábado (4) em Omaha, Nebraska – terra natal e sede da empresa do bilionário. Ao final da conferência, Buffett se despediu dos participantes em tom bem humorado. Ele disse esperar estar presente na conferência do próximo ano – arrancando risadas do público e aplausos de investidores e acionistas. O InfoMoney fez a cobertura em tempo real com a presença do enviado especial Henrique Esteter, coordenador multiplataforma, com transmissão de live sobre os pontos altos do encontro que reuniu investidores do mundo todo, incluindo um grupo de brasileiros. Assista à live das 18h sobre os pontos altos do encontro. Continua depois da publicidade Veja a seguir algumas das frases proferidas pelo “Oráculo de Omaha” que marcaram sua participação no evento: “Veremos como a próxima gestão jogará o jogo na Berkshire, [mas] felizmente você não terá que esperar muito por isso. Me sinto bem, mas conheço um pouco de tábua atuarial”. “Qualquer pessoa que queira se aposentar aos 65 anos seria desqualificada como potencial CEO da Berkshire” Continua depois da publicidade “Charlie chegou a 99,9 anos. Se eu tivesse mais um dia com Charlie, provavelmente faria a mesma coisa de sempre”. “Quando você pensa sobre o potencial de enganar as pessoas, se você puder reproduzir imagens que nem consigo dizer, que dizem, ‘Preciso de dinheiro’, ‘Acabei de sofrer um acidente de carro, preciso de US$ 50 mil’. Quero dizer, fraudes sempre fizeram parte do cenário americano, mas se eu estivesse interessado em investir em fraudes, fosse a indústria em crescimento de todos os tempos”, afirmou. “Não me incomoda nem um pouco preencher esse cheque – e eu realmente espero que, com tudo o que a América fez por todos vocês, não deveria incomodá-los que façamos isso [sobre o pagamento de mais impostos para as contas públicas dos EUA] – e se eu estiver fazendo isso a 21% este ano e a uma porcentagem um pouco maior mais tarde, não acho que você realmente se importará com o fato de termos vendido um pouco da Apple este ano”. Continua depois da publicidade “Somos donos da Coca-Cola, que é um negócio maravilhoso. E somos donos da Apple, que é um negócio ainda melhor, e seremos donos, a menos que algo realmente extraordinário aconteça, seremos donos da Apple, da American Express e da Coca-Cola.” “A atual estratégia de alocação de capital permanecerá intacta durante os próximos anos: comprar empresas maravilhosas a um preço justo”. “Às vezes, fizemos coisas que foram grandes erros”, disse ele. “Mas nunca chegamos perto de erros fatais.” Continua depois da publicidade “Nosso caixa e títulos do Tesouro eram de US$ 182 bilhões no final do trimestre, e acho que é razoável supor que provavelmente estarão em cerca de US$ 200 bilhões no final deste trimestre”. “A decisão foi 100% minha. Vendemos tudo e perdemos bastante dinheiro”. “Como investidor você deve ir onde a concorrência é fraca. A concorrência é mais fraca nas empresas menores”.

    "published_at": "2024-05-04T20:06:24Z",
    "content": "Warren Buffett, the billionaire co-founder and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, offered some insights Saturday at the company's annual meeting into the decision to reduce its stake in tech giant Apple, which was and remains its largest stock holding. Berkshire's stake in Apple fell by 22% to $135.4 billion as of March 31 from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023, even as the iPhone maker's share price fell just 11%. The conglomerate appears to have sold about 115 million shares, or 13% of its holdings in the quarter. The sale resulted in Berkshire realizing an $11.2 billion after-tax gain in the quarter from its sale of Apple stock and contributed to the rise in the company's cash holdings to a record of $189 billion. Despite Berkshire reducing its holdings in Apple, Buffett said he expects it to remain the company's largest stock investment. \"We have sold shares and I would say that at the end of the year I would think it extremely likely that Apple is the largest common stock holding we have,\" Buffett said. He went on to explain how he and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, viewed their stock investments in companies like Apple. BUFFETT RETAKES THE STAGE AS BERKSHIRE PREPARES TO PASS THE BATON \"One interesting thing is that Charlie and I looked at common stocks or marketable equities or the things that people love to look at as being businesses, and so when we own a Dairy Queen, or we own whatever it may be, we look at it as a business. When we own Coca-Cola or American Express or Apple, we look at that as a business,\" Buffett explained. READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP \"Now, we can buy really wonderful companies in the market as businesses — we can't buy all of their shares, we can't buy 90% or 80% or anything like that,\" he added. Buffett went on to say those companies and Apple are \"wonderful\" businesses and that Berkshire's assessment of those firms is such that they'll remain major holdings unless something dramatic occurs. WARREN BUFFETT PAYS TRIBUTE TO FRIEND, CHARLIE MUNGER AS 'ARCHITECT' OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY \"We will own — unless something really extraordinary happens — we will own Apple and American Express and Coca-Cola when Greg takes over this place,\" Buffett said. Later in the question-and-answer session, Buffett cited Apple CEO Tim Cook's leadership as a reason for his confidence in the tech giant and said he has been a great successor to the late Steve Jobs. Buffett also touched on the tax consequences of selling Apple stock at this time when the capital gains tax rate is lower than it has been historically and said that it may be higher again in the future as the government looks to narrow the budget deficit. He also said that given alternatives in the market and uncertainty around the world, holding a larger cash stake is preferable. WARREN BUFFET BLASTS GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN ANNUAL LETTER \"I don't mind at all under current conditions building the cash position. I think when I look at the alternative of what's available in the equity markets and I look at the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive,\" Buffett said. \"Almost everybody I know pays a lot more attention to not paying taxes than I think they should. We don't mind paying taxes at Berkshire, and we are paying a 21% federal rate on the gains we're taking in Apple and that rate was 35% not too long ago, and it's been 52% in the past when I've been operating,\" Buffett said. \"It doesn't bother me in the least to write that check and I would really hope that with all that America has done for all of you, it shouldn't bother you that we do it and if I'm doing it at 21%, and we're doing it at a lot higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind that we sold a little Apple this year,\" he explained.

    "content": " Related Stories On Friday afternoon, on the floor of the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, I ran into my seatmate from the flight from Washington, D.C. to Omaha — a lovely woman working the Geico booth. \"Bill Murray is here,\" she told me. I told her I'd keep my eyes peeled. Of course, to the tens of thousands of shareholders who flock each year to Nebraska, Murray, or any other celebrity, is second fiddle to the real star of the show, Warren Buffett, and in years past his right-hand man Charlie Munger, who died in 2023. Around these parts, the honchos at Berkshire do have one key thing in common with Murray: everyone who's met them seems to have a story. Earlier on Friday, I attended VALUEx BRK one of the many gatherings of investors that crop up around Omaha as sort of satellite Berkshire meetings. Run by Guy Spier, manager of the Zurich-based Aquamarine Fund, the event featured talks from a wide array of value investing enthusiasts, from investment managers to academics to authors to Munger's longtime assistant Doerthe Obert. Just about everyone who had encountered one of the Berkshire luminaries shared some of the wisdom they imparted. Here's what you can learn from their stories. Monsoon Pabrai, managing partner and portfolio manager of Drew Investment Research, recalled a lunch where she and her sister — both young girls at the time — sat on either side of Buffett. She took careful note of the three-and-a-half-hour conversation, but tends to return to one piece of advice. \"The one that always stuck with me was that he looked me and my sister in the eye, because we're women, or young girls, and said, 'The most important decision you make is who you marry,'\" she said. \"I think that goes for both partners in a marriage. It's really important who you pick to be your life partner.\" Indeed, it's advice that Buffett echoed at the shareholder meeting on Saturday. In response to a question about advice everyone needs to hear, Buffett urged shareholders to think about the way they'd like their obituaries to read and to pursue life accordingly. \"Certainly in my day it would have been marrying the person who could help you do that,\" he said. William Greene, author of \"The Great Minds of Investing\" spoke alongside photographer Michael O'Brien about the experience of profiling and photographing Munger. An encounter with his friend, Berkshire board member Chris Davis, reminded him of a key piece of advice from Munger: surround yourself with images of your idols. \"Charlie told him very early on, put photos of people you admire in your office, because they're people you don't want to disappoint.\" Munger famously owned a bust of his hero, Benjamin Franklin, Greene noted. Greene, in turn, has a bust of Munger. \"I think this idea of structuring your physical environment to have pictures of people you admire is a really good hack. It's tilting the odds of you behaving decently,\" Greene said. Gillian Segal, author of \"Getting There: A Book of Mentors\" spoke about her persistence in nailing down an interview with Buffett. After failing to get through to him remotely, she pinned him down at a charity event, where he agreed to lend her a few minutes of his time. When it came time to schedule their meeting, Segal was in for a surprise. \"Once I had gotten in past [Buffett's assistant], she was telling me all of the available times, and it was like, 'OK, this week he's available Monday,' and it was a huge block of time. Tuesday, huge block of time, Wednesday, he has this. Thursday, huge block of time,\" she says. \"And I just realized he is who he is because he guards his time. And he has time to do the important things. He's not overscheduled.\" Chances are, you don't have nearly as many people as Buffett does asking for your time – or an assistant who is an expert at guarding it. But it's an example that's useful for anyone: To be successful in your career, you'll need time to give it your undivided attention. Munger's longtime assistant Doerthe Obert told a litany of charming, personal stories about Munger, from his focus on his work to his attempts at dieting. Her recollections of her working relationship with Munger are instructive for anyone who has employees. \"We had such a good working relationship, and he just trusted me completely,\" she said. \"You'll handle it – whatever it was. You'll get it done.\" Trusting his assistant to do her work let Munger do his. And when it came to the working relationship, Munger was happy to stay in his lane, too. When I asked her what, if anything her boss taught her about investing, Obert demurred. \"He never talked to anybody about investing once,\" she told me. Never? Not even in passing? \"No. Because if he gave some advice and it [might not] work out,\" she said. \"If he loses some money, it's not so bad. But if I would lose a lot? He didn't want that responsibility.\"  Want to make extra money outside of your day job? Sign up for CNBC's new online course How to Earn Passive Income Online to learn about common passive income streams, tips to get started and real-life success stories.

    "title": "Berkshire Hathaway’s profits plunge 64 per cent as thousands gather to soak up Warren Buffett’s wisdom",
    "description": "Buffett chaired the first annual meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-04T19:56:56Z",
    "content": "Share this article Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reported a steep drop in earnings on Saturday as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. Nevertheless, tens of thousands of shareholders looked forward to hearing from Buffett directly, buoyed by a jump in performance of the many companies Berkshire operates directly. Berkshire reported a US$12.7 billion profit, or US$8.825 per Class A share, in the first quarter, down 64% from US$35.5 billion, or US$24,377 per A share a year ago. Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate’s operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. Operating earnings jumped 39% to US$11.222 billion, or US$7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies’ strong performance. By that measure, Berkshire beat expectations of the three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research, who had predicted operating earnings of US$6,701.87 per Class A share. As part of Buffett’s stock sales, he trimmed about 13% of Berkshire’s massive Apple stake. Holdings in the iPhone maker are still Berkshire’s biggest stake, making up US$135.4 billion of the company’s US$364 billion portfolio. Buffett said he expects Apple to remain the biggest investment for years, even when his successor Greg Abel eventually takes over. As for Berkshire’s core insurance businesses, the conglomerate reported a US$2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from US$911 million a year ago. BNSF railroad’s profits dropped 8% to US$1.143 billion, but most of Bershire’s many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profit at the utility unit that added US$717 million to earnings. Cash on hand rose to a record US$188.993 billion in the quarter. “We’d love to spend it but we won’t spend it unless we’re doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,” Buffett said. Tens of thousands filled the arena eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting ‘Woodstock for Capitalists.’ But a key ingredient is missing this year: It’s the first meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died. The meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best-known quotes, including classic lines like “If people weren’t so often wrong, we wouldn’t be so rich.” The video also featured classic skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a “Desperate Housewives” spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him. As the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honouring Munger, whom Buffett called “the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.” Buffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, attending dinner parties, meetings and regular Zoom calls. “Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,” Buffett said. For decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger’s witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as “turds.” Together, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies. Munger often summed up the key Berkshire’s success as “trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.” He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well. “Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,” said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting. Munger’s absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire’s companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett’s successor. Abel and Jain shared the main stage with Buffett for the first time this year. The first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said “Charlie?” Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators’ reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit. Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about. “Greg’s a rock star,” said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. “The bench is deep. He won’t have the same humour at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.” As always, Buffett addressed a variety of topics on Saturday, though he never talks politics or reveals what he is buying. The stock he has been buying over the past year will remain a secret until he’s required to disclose it in filings. He described a recent uneasy experience with artificial intelligence, saying he saw a fake image of himself delivering a message in his voice about something he said he would never say. He predicted the technology will be a boon for scammers, and he’s not sure if it will do more good than harm. The fake video was so convincing Buffett said he might have sent money to himself overseas. “It has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don’t know how that plays out,” he said. On climate change, Jain said it’s creating larger losses for insurance companies and driving up prices. It’s hard to know if prices are increasing enough to handle the risk, but at least insurers have the opportunity to recalibrate their premiums each year, Jain said. “We get a lot of letters from people concerned about climate change — and I don’t think they’re wrong,” Buffett said. “But they don’t understand the insurance business.” Overall, Buffett said Berkshire’s system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. The 93-year-old says he hardly gets any calls from managers any more because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain. “This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,” Buffett said.

But the Oracle of Omaha still sees Apple as a critical part of Berkshire’s portfolio. Berkshire’s holdings in Apple were valued at $135.4 billion for first quarter of 2024, a 22% drop from $174.3 billion as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to its first-quarter earnings report released Saturday. It was the second consecutive quarter that the conglomerate has reduced its holdings of the iPhone maker. Apple’s share price fell 11% in the quarter, as the tech giant endured a rough start to 2024. Given those figures, Berkshire sold roughly 13% of its  holdings in the company last quarter, leaving it with about 790 million Apple shares. But Buffett said during the morning question-and-answer session at Berkshire’s annual shareholder conference on Saturday that it’s “extremely likely” that Apple remains Berkshire’s largest common stock holding — and that it will stay that way unless something dramatic happens. “Unless something really extraordinary happens, we will own Apple, and American Express, and Coca-Cola when Greg takes over this place,” the 93-year-old Buffett said, referring to Greg Abel, his handpicked successor. Berkshire reported that its American Express stake was worth $34.5 billion last quarter, and its Coca-Cola holdings were worth $24.5 billion. Chevron and Bank of America were also in the company’s top five holdings, with stakes valued at $19.4 billion and $39.2 billion, respectively. Read more: Warren Buffett on Berkshire Hathaway selling Apple stock, AI, and life after Charlie Munger Apple CEO Tim Cook was in the auditorium during Saturday’s Q&A session. He suggested that the sale may have been to avoid higher taxes, if the federal government decides to increase tax rates. “It doesn’t bother me in the least to write that check, and I would really hope with all that America’s done for all of you, it shouldn’t bother you that we do it,” Buffett said. “And if I’m doing it at 21% this year, and we’re doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don’t think you’ll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year.” Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire added $21 billion in cash and Treasuries to its pile, bringing it to a record $189 billion last quarter — a 13% increase in just three months. In the same quarter, Berkshire offloaded a net $17 billion worth of stocks and bought back $2.6 billion worth of its own stock, up from $2.2 billion in the prior quarter.

    "content": "Fund next-gen business journalism with $10 a month Search Free Newsletters Warren Buffett admittedly isn’t an expert on artificial intelligence — but what he does know makes him nervous. Speaking at a question-and-answer session at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders conference Saturday, Buffett  likened the advent of AI to his views on nuclear weapons. The Berkshire CEO referenced his remarks from the previous year’s conference, recalling that he had described the atomic bomb as a genie let out of the bottom that “has been doing some terrible things” and “scares the hell out of” him. “AI is somewhat similar, it’s part  way out of the bottle, and it’s enormously important and it’s gonna be done by somebody,” Buffet said Saturday. “We may wish we’d never seen that genie, or it may do wonderful things.” While he said he’s not very familiar with the technology, he had one experience that made him “a little nervous” about AI: He stumbled across a video using his likeness generated by AI, “delivering a message that in no way” came from him. He worried that that could open the floodgates for potential scams, calling it “the growth industry of all time.” “I do think, as someone who doesn’t understand a damn thing about about it, that it has enormous potential for good, and enormous potential for harm,” he said. “And I just don’t know how that plays out.” Read more: Warren Buffett on Berkshire Hathaway selling Apple stock, AI, and life after Charlie Munger The highly anticipated and closely watch annual conference, dubbed “Woodstock for Capitalists” by its fans, kicked off Friday in Buffett’s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska.

E Buffett allenta la presa su Apple. La battaglia dell'intelligenza artificiale Ascolta ora: \"ChatGpt pronta a lanciare l’anti-Google\" ChatGpt pronta a lanciare l’anti-Google Probabilmente nel quartier generale di Google non tira una buona aria in attesa del 9 maggio. Già perchè quel giorno, secondo indiscrezioni sempre più insistenti, verrà svelato il nuovo motore di ricerca di OpenAI, la società guidata da Sam Altman che ha sviluppato il celebre ChatGpt. Se così fosse, per Alphabet (la capogruppo di Google) si affaccerebbe all’orizzonte un competitor potenzialmente capace di mettere in discussione il suo trentennale strapotere in un campo dove occupa una quota di mercato del 90 per cento. In verità nell’ambiente tech se ne parla da tempo. Il tam tam ha preso nuovo vigore dopo che un utente su Reddit ha segnalato l’esistenza del dominio «https://search.chatgpt.com», ma al momento digitandolo ci si scontra sulla scritta «not found» ovvero non trovato. Per distinguere se si tratta di verità o leggenda, in ogni caso, basterà aspettare pochi giorni. Certo è che Altman da tempo ha annunciato la sua volontà di far lavorare insieme i cosiddetti generatori di testi basati sull’intelligenza artificiale (vedi ChatGpt) e la ricerca sul web, una fusione che dovrebbe dare vita a un prodotto molto più potente e in grado di dare risposte più precise e dettagliate ai navigatori di Internet. Le aspettative sono alte, anche perché si scrive OpenAI, ma si legge Microsoft. Il big guidato da Satya Nadella ha investito oltre 13 miliardi di dollari nella società di Altman e ne sta raccogliendo i frutti. Tant’è che gli ultimi conti trimestrali vedono un aumento degli utili del 20% proprio grazie all’intelligenza artificiale e la stessa Microsoft ha iniziato a potenziare il suo motore di ricerca Bing proprio con l’IA. Altrettanto vero è che il gruppo guidato dal ceo Sundar Pichai non è fermo: ha investito tanto per sviluppare Gemini (il suo ChatGpt) e si dice sia pronto a presentare la sua contro-mossa a stretto giro, quando alla conferenza degli sviluppatori del 14 maggio probabilmente verranno annunciati progressi sul fronte dell’IA e una risposta a OpenAI. Ma se l’accoppiata ChatGpt-Microsoft è al momento la più pericolosa per Google, anche i ritardatari dell’intelligenza artificiale stanno premendo per recuperare il terreno perduto. Il capo di Apple, Tim Cook, sta vedendo scricchiolii nel suo impero: le vendite fiacche di iPhone (-10% rispetto al primo trimestre 2023) e l’assenza di innovazioni ne potrebbero segnare il declino. Non a caso un vecchio lupo degli investimenti, Warren Buffett, con la sua Berkshire Hathaway (che nei primi tre mesi ha avuto un utile operativo monstre di 11,2 miliardi) ha aggiornato nell’ultimo trimestre il valore della sua quota in Apple: -22% a 135,4 miliardi a fronte del -11% registrato a Wall Street. In questo contesto si legge la trovata di Cook di annunciare un maxi buyback da 110 miliardi di dollari per sostenere il titolo, il più grande riacquisto di azioni della storia di Cupertino. Si lavora anche sul fronte AI, negli ultimi anni la Mela ha investito per sottrarre specialisti a Google a cui avrebbe portato via 36 tra i migliori dal 2018 a oggi. Secondo il Financial Times avrebbe realizzato un laboratorio segreto in Europa, a Zurigo, nell’intento di sviluppare nuovi prodotti che sfruttino l’intelligenza artificiale. Si prepara a puntare forte sull’IA anche Meta (la casa di Facebook e Instagram), finora a metà del guado sul suo progetto Metaverso. Il ceo Mark Zuckerberg, infatti, durante la presentazione degli ultimi conti ha indicato un target di costi fino a 10 miliardi superiore per lo sviluppo dell’IA nel 2024.\n\n\n\n\n Un annuncio che ha fatto crollare il titolo (-15%), ma che potrebbe pagare sul lungo termine.  \r\n\t\t\tSpiacenti, devi abilitare javascript per poter procedere.\r\n\t\t"

    "content": "Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway offloaded around 13% of its Apple holdings in Q1 2024, the conglomerate revealed this weekend. Despite selling around 115 million shares, however, Buffett reaffirmed his commitment to AAPL going forward.  Meanwhile, Tim Cook, who made the trip to Omaha for Berkshire’s annual meeting on Saturday, praised Buffett for his belief in Apple.  As reported by CNBC, Berkshire’s Q1 2024 earnings report revealed that its stake in Apple is now worth $135.4 billion – indicating that it holds around 790 million shares. Based on Apple’s stock price, this would mean Berkshire sold about 115 million shares, CNBC says.  Still, Apple is Berkshire’s largest holding by a wide margin. Likewise, Berkshire is Apple’s largest shareholder outside of ETF providers.  During Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting on Saturday, Buffett praised Apple and said it’s an “an even better business” than two of the conglomerate’s other major holdings, American Express and Coca-Cola. Buffett also assured investors: “Unless something dramatic happens that really changes capital allocation, we will have Apple as our largest investment.”  Buffett didn’t offer specific details on why Berkshire sold 13% of its Apple holdings in the quarter. He did, however, imply that it was to increase its cash stake for tax purposes:  “It doesn’t bother me in the least to write that check and I would really hope with all that America’s done for all of you, it shouldn’t bother you that we do it and if I’m doing it at 21% this year and we’re doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don’t think you’ll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year.” Apple CEO Tim Cook was in the audience of Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on Saturday. With regard to Berkshire’s decision to offload some of its Apple holdings, Cook told CNBC that “it’s a privilege to have them as a shareholder.” When Berkshire sold 10 million shares of AAPL in 2020, Buffett later admitted that the decision “was probably a mistake.” In Q4 2023, Berkshire offloaded around 1% of its AAPL holdings (10 million shares), so this marks the second consecutive quarter that the conglomerate reduced its stake in Apple.

A afirmação foi feita durante a reunião anual de acionistas da companhia em Omaha, Nebraska, neste sábado (4). Buffett declarou que pretende deixar a alocação de capital sob os cuidados de Greg, que respondeu a perguntas dos acionistas a seu lado. “E ele entende muito bem de negócios”, disse aos acionistas. “As somas cresceram tanto na Berkshire e não queremos tentar ter duas pessoas por perto que gerem bilhões cada. Simplesmente não funciona”, acrescentou, descartando uma possível divisão do cargo. “Veremos como a próxima gestão jogará o jogo na Berkshire, [mas] felizmente você não terá que esperar muito por isso. Me sinto bem, mas conheço um pouco de tábua atuarial”, disse, brincando sobre as estimativas de expectativa de vida em seu país. Continua depois da publicidade Ainda sobre sucessão no conglomerado, o “Oráculo de Omaha” declarou que “qualquer pessoa que queira se aposentar aos 65 anos seria desqualificada como potencial CEO da Berkshire”, afastando qualquer especulação de que seu substituto duraria pouco tempo no cargo. Baixe um ebook gratuito que revela o método Warren Buffett de investir em ações Abel, de 61 anos, é canadense e ocupa desde 2018 uma das vice-presidências da Berkshire Hathaway. Seu nome ganhou destaque a partir de 2021, quando o “Oráculo de Omaha”, como Buffett é conhecido, confirmou que Abel será seu sucessor na presidência da holding. Ainda não há uma data definida para essa transição ocorrer. Continua depois da publicidade A ausência do “braço direito” de Buffett, Charlie Munger – falecido em outubro de 2023 –, foi sentida durante o evento. Ao finalizar um comentário sobre investimentos em energia, o lendário investidor disse: “Naturalmente, Charlie”, como fazia à espera de seu comentário. A menção levou a aplausos. Buffett queria, na verdade, passar a palavra para Abel, seu sucessor. O InfoMoney faz uma cobertura especial da conferência anual de acionistas da Berkshire Hathaway. Henrique Esteter, coordenador multiplataforma, acompanha o evento como enviado especial a Omaha, no estado americano de Nebraska. Às 18h, acompanhe a live sobre os pontos altos do encontro. A reunião da Berkshire é diferente da maioria dos encontros com acionistas promovidos por outras empresas. De um lado, o dia é uma vitrine para as muitas companhias nas quais Buffett tem participação – elas montam estandes na CHI Health Center Arena, em Omaha, no estado de Nebraska, onde ocorre o evento.

    "content": "Berkshire Hathaway says its first quarter profit plummeted on the paper value of its investments OMAHA, Neb. -- Berkshire Hathaway's first quarter profits plummeted along with the paper value of its investments, but the company said Saturday that most of the businesses it owns outright performed well. The company reported reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That’s roughly one-third of last year's $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share. The figures were heavily influenced by a large drop in the paper value of Berkshire’s investments. Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate’s operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. Operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year’s $8.065 billion as its insurance companies showed strong results. On a per share basis, this year's first quarter operating figure amounts to $7,796.47 per Class A share, beating three analysts' estimates by FactSet Research, who predicted $6,701.87 per Class A share. Buffett was a net seller of $17 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13% of Berkshire’s massive Apple stake. At $135.4 billion, the iPhone maker still accounts for the biggest share of Berkshire's $364 billion portfolio. Buffett said he expects it to remain so even up to when his successor Greg Abel takes over. The estimated value of Berkshire’s Apple stake suggests Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. In the past, Buffett has said he invested in Apple’s stock because of how devoted consumers are to the company's products, similar to consumer brands he loves like Berkshire's own See's Candy. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder, and he knew about the sales before Berkshire disclosed them Saturday. Berkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago, as Geico in particular continued to improve its results. However, BNSF railroad’s profits dropped 8% to $1.143 billion. Most of Berkshire's many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit, adding $717 million to Berkshire’s total. Revenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion. With no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire’s cash pile climbed to a record $188.993 billion even after it spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year. Holdings including Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash. “We’d love to spend it but we won’t spend it unless we’re doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,” Buffett said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

But “Woodstock for capitalists” took place without Charlie Munger, Buffett’s longtime business partner who passed away in November. The meeting featured a video tribute to Munger, who served as vice chairman, and praise from Buffett, who said Munger was the best person to talk to about managing money, according to remarks broadcast on CNBC. “I trust my children and my wife totally, but that doesn’t mean I ask them what stocks to buy,” he said. Artificial intelligence risks Buffett also recalled seeing an AI-generated image of himself and warned on the technology’s potential for scamming people. “Scamming has always been part of the American scene,” he told shareholders. “But this would make me—if I was interested in investing in scamming—it’s going to be the growth industry of all time.” He then likened AI to nuclear weapons, saying “I don’t know any way to get the genie back in the bottle, and AI is somewhat similar,” according to CNBC. Succession outlook Buffett, 93, had already indicated three years ago that Vice Chairman of Non-Insurance Operations Greg Abel would take over for him.  But he dropped a hint on Saturday about when new management would actually come into office, saying “you don’t have too long to wait on that.” While he said he feels fine, he quipped that he shouldn’t sign any four-year employment contracts. Buffett also confirmed that Abel will be in charge of investing decisions, saying that responsibility “ought to be entirely” with the next CEO. Questions had arisen about Berkshire’s closely followed portfolio as Buffett has acknowledged he delegated some calls and that certain stock picks were made by others. Canada investment? Buffett has lamented the lack of attractive investment opportunities in recent years, allowing Berkshire’s massive stockpile of cash and cash equivalents to reach fresh record highs.  Indeed, it surged to $189 billion at the end of the first quarter from $167.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. On Saturday, Buffett reiterated that when it comes to investments, “we only swing at pitches we like.” But he also teased, “We do not feel uncomfortable in any way shape or form putting our money into Canada. In fact, we’re actually looking at one thing now.” Those comments came after he touched on his investment in Japanese trading houses, saying it’s “unlikely we will make any large commitments in other countries.”  © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

He is also a co-founder and a commissioning editor at Hypatia Press, a publisher that specializes in philosophical works that challenge religion or spirituality.  \n\tDonald Trump's first criminal trial has been filled with salacious testimony, but a well-known financial reporter who has been covering the former president for years said on Saturday that one thing in particular simply didn't add up.\n \n\tNew York Times reporter Susanne Craig, who is known for following the finances of Trump and his business empire, appeared on MSNBC over the weekend to talk about Trump and his current trial. In that case in Manhattan, the ex-president is accused with more than 30 felonies in connection with an alleged scheme to impact the 2016 election by covering up hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. \n\tThe host asked Craig about testimony that could potentially \"humanize\" Trump, including an anecdote that Trump's longtime aide, Hope Hicks, shared on Friday. She said under oath that Trump asked that the newspaper not be delivered after news broke of his alleged affairs, potentially bolstering Trump's defense that he wasn't trying to affect the election with the purported payments meant to silence Daniels.\n ALSO READ: Trump vs. history: Former presidents typically implode on their comeback tours \n\t\"I am curious how Donald Trump handled himself in court listening to this formerly close aide, someone described as being like a daughter to him. Did she manage to humanize him to the jury, particularly when she said the part like, he did not want the newspapers to be delivered to the home, to the residence for fear that Melania would see them and get upset. \"\n \n\tCraig said that comment was \"interesting because you imagine Melania in this tower with no other information, so we won't drop off the newspapers.\"\n \n\t\"That did not add up to me,\" she said of the comment, which could be seen as one of the few hints Trump was thinking about Melania's reaction as opposed to the general election.\n \n\tOn Trump's behavior while Hicks made her comments, Craig said that, for the most part, \"he's sitting there and he has his eyes closed.\" She said he didn't even react much when Hicks burst into tears on the stand. \n\t\"He is trying not to have any reaction to what is going on in the courtroom,\" she explained. \"Occasionally he will pay attention and be watching a witness. For the most part, we are not seeing that. I'm interested in how that is playing with the jury. They are watching him and seeing that.

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File) Berkshire’s cash pile: After Berkshire’s earning report showed the conglomerate’s cash pile had risen to a record $189 billion, Buffett said it’s a “fair assumption” that its cash and treasuries would exceed $200 billion at the end of this quarter, adding the company would “love to spend it” but wouldn’t unless it was on “something that has very little risk and could make us a lot of money.” Apple: Buffett said Berkshire’s opinion on the virtue of Apple stock had not changed despite Saturday’s news Berkshire sold a reported 13% of its stock in the tech giant this quarter, saying it was “extremely likely” Apple would remain Berkshire’s biggest investment by the end of the year “unless something really dramatic happens.” Taxes: He suggested selling Apple stock now could help Berkshire pay larger tax rates in the future, as he believes the federal government will soon increase corporate taxes, which he would not oppose, saying ”It doesn’t bother me in the least to write that check,” adding that “with all America has done for all of you, it shouldn’t bother you that we do it.” Artificial intelligence: Buffett sounded the alarm on advancements in artificial intelligence, recalling how he was startled by an AI-generated video of himself created by a scammer, saying artificial intelligence could make scamming the “growth industry of all time” and that while acknowledging it’s “enormously important,” he compared its potential to do harm to nuclear weapons, arguing: “we may wish we’d never seen that genie or it may do wonderful things.” Foreign investments: Buffett said that he doesn’t anticipate Berkshire making many significant investments outside the U.S., except the conglomerate was willing to invest in Canada, and was in the midst of “looking at one thing now.” Succession: Buffett, 93, teased his eventual succession, quipping that investors “don’t have too long to wait,” adding “I feel fine, but I know a little bit about actuarial tables” (he has already named Greg Abel, Berkshire’s vice chairman of non-insurance operations, as his eventual successor).

Berkshire on Saturday reported profits of $12.7 billion—a fraction of the $35.5 billion it reported in the first quarter of last year—but this drop was driven almost exclusively by a sharp drop in the value of Berkshire’s stock portfolio. The conglomerate’s operating earnings, or the profits generated directly by the businesses that it owns, rose 39%, from $8.065 billion in the first quarter of 2023 to $11.2 billion this year. Buffett has long argued operating profits are a more valuable metric than net profits. Berkshire benefited from a strong performance from its insurance businesses, which include Geico, and its operating earnings from insurance underwriting rose to $2.6 billion from $911 million last year. Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholders meeting in Omaha is a hotly anticipated financial event each year, with investors eagerly awaiting to hear Buffett’s advice and predictions on finances and the economy. It’s often referred to as “Woodstock for capitalists.” But this year’s event took on a different tenor, as it was the first time Buffett took the stage to speak with shareholders without Charlie Munger, his longtime friend and business partner who died last year.  This year’s event was filled with tributes to Munger, including a video featuring Munger’s and Buffett’s many interviews and pop culture appearances—like on the sitcom “the Office.” While answering questions from investors, Buffett turned to Abel and mistakenly called him “Charlie,” drawing laughter and cheer from the crowd. “I’d actually checked myself a couple times already,” Buffett said. “I’ll slip again.” "

Abel has been overseeing a major portion of Berkshire's sprawling empire, including energy, railroad and retail. Buffett offered the clearest insight into his succession plan to date after years of speculation about the exact roles of Berkshire's top executives after the eventual transition. The investing icon, who's turning 94 in August, said his decision is influenced by how much Berkshire's assets have grown. \"I used to think differently about how that would be handled, but I think that responsibility should be that of the CEO and whatever that CEO decides may be helpful,\" Buffett said. \"The sums have grown so large at Berkshire, and we do not want to try and have 200 people around that are managing a billion each. It just doesn't work.\" Berkshire's cash pile ballooned to nearly $189 billion at the end of March, while its gigantic equity portfolio has stocks worth a whopping $362 billion based on current market prices. \"I think what you're handling the sums that we will have, you've got to think very strategically about how to do very big things,\" Buffett added. \"I think the responsibility ought to be entirely with Greg.\" While Buffett has made clear that Abel would be taking over the CEO job, there were still questions about who would control the Berkshire public stock portfolio, where Buffett has garnered a huge following by racking up huge returns through investments in the likes of Coca-Cola and Apple. Berkshire investing managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, both former hedge fund managers, have helped Buffett manage a small portion of the stock  portfolio (about 10%) for about the last decade. There was speculation that they may take over that portion of the Berkshire CEO role when he is no longer able. But it seems, based on Buffett's latest comments, that Abel will have final decisions on all capital allocation — including stock picks. \"I think the chief executive should be somebody that can weigh buying businesses, buying stocks, doing all kinds of things that might come up at a time when nobody else is willing to move,\" Buffett said. Abel is known for his strong expertise in the energy industry. Berkshire acquired MidAmerican Energy in 1999 and Abel became CEO of the company in 2008, six years before it was renamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy in 2014.

Ele comparou a tecnologia a armas nucleares, quanto a seu potencial para grandes mudanças. Baixe um ebook gratuito que revela o método Warren Buffett de investir em ações Ao falar sobre o assunto para uma plateia de cerca de 30 mil pessoas, o “Oráculo de Omaha” afirmou que não “sabe nada” sobre IA, mas relatou ter visto recentemente uma imagem sua gerada por ferramentas de iteligência artificial e que isso o deixou nervoso com a tecnologia. Continua depois da publicidade “Quando você pensa sobre o potencial de enganar as pessoas, se você puder reproduzir imagens que nem consigo dizer, que dizem, ‘Preciso de dinheiro’, ‘Acabei de sofrer um acidente de carro, preciso de US$ 50 mil’. Quero dizer, fraudes sempre fizeram parte do cenário americano, mas se eu estivesse interessado em investir em fraudes, fosse a indústria em crescimento de todos os tempos”, afirmou. Buffett acrescentou que o ser humano deixou “o gênio sair da garrafa” quando desenvolveu armas nucleares. “Esse gênio tem feito coisas terríveis ultimamente, e o poder desse gênio é o que, você sabe, me assusta muito”, acrescentou. “E não conheço nenhuma maneira de colocar o gênio de volta na garrafa, e a IA é um tanto semelhante.” O InfoMoney faz uma cobertura especial da conferência anual de acionistas da Berkshire Hathaway.

De outro, os participantes têm a chance real de fazer perguntas diretamente a Buffett – que será acompanhado no palco por Greg Abel, responsável pelas operações não relacionadas a seguros da Berkshire, e por Ajit Jain, que supervisiona especificamente os negócios de seguros.
