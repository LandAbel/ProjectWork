事實上，巴菲特於2021年接受CNBC採訪時，就曾透露阿貝爾是自己欽點的法定接班人，儘管外界難免質疑，接班人是否能媲美這位傳奇投資人，但波克夏董事會也相信，阿貝爾是合適的人選。 根據《美聯社》報導，波克夏董事會成員奧爾森（Ron Olson）日前向投資人介紹阿貝爾，強調此人掌握巴菲特的所有指導原則，包括讓波克夏旗下企業在一定程度上能自主營運。 奧爾森認為，阿貝爾與巴菲特一樣對數字很敏銳，能快速、準確剖析企業的資產負債表，也是一名很好的傾聽者，可能不向巴菲特能擁有大批全球粉絲，但一樣能把波克夏經營的很好。 那麼阿貝爾是何方神聖？根據《Business Insider》撰文介紹，此人生於1962年 6月1日，取得加拿大亞伯達大學商學位，曾經作為註冊會計師加入地熱發電生產商CalEnergy，隨著CalEnergy於1999年收購中美能源（MidAmerican Energy），同年隨著波克夏收購中美能源，阿貝爾就此進入巴菲特的視野，憑藉優異的工作表現，目前任職波克夏海瑟威能源公司董事長，且在2018年透過波克夏海瑟威董事會獲得董事席位，被任命為波克夏海瑟威公司非保險業務的副董事長。

    "published_at": "2024-05-02T22:50:07Z",
    "content": "By Jonathan Stempel and Koh Gui Qing OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - A longtime Berkshire Hathaway director said Greg Abel, who is expected to succeed Warren Buffett as chief executive, may not get the same leeway from the conglomerate's board of directors to make acquisitions. Ronald Olson, a Berkshire director since 1997, said at an investing conference on Thursday that the board would not \"handcuff\" Abel from making acquisitions, in his expected role in allocating Berkshire's capital. But he also said Abel's recent handling of difficult litigation against the billionaire Haslam family over the acquisition of truck stop chain Pilot Travel Centers cemented confidence in his leadership. It was the first time Olson, a lawyer, said he worked closely with Abel. \"There [are] going to be changes in terms of the confidence level that we had in Warren,\" Olson said when asked if Abel would have the same latitude as Buffett to spend cash as he saw fit. \"I don't know how changes will evolve when somebody replaces Warren. Let's not get too anxious about it. He's going to be around for a while. But once that happens, there may well be changes.\" At Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday, Buffett and Abel are likely to get shareholder questions about the conglomerate's future after Abel takes over. Succession at Berkshire has long been on investors' minds as Buffett aged, working at least two decades past when most top executives retire. Those concerns grew after his longtime second-in-command Charlie Munger died in November at age 99. Berkshire acknowledged that Abel was Buffett's successor-in-waiting after Munger let slip at Berkshire's 2021 annual meeting when discussing Berkshire's decentralized, hands-off business model that \"Greg will keep the culture.\" Abel, 61, has since 2018 been a vice chairman overseeing Berkshire's non-insurance businesses including the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, his former home. After Buffett leaves, his son Howard Buffett is expected to become nonexecutive chairman, while others would handle common stock investments. The dispute with the Haslams, including Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, centered on how much Berkshire should pay for the 20% of Pilot it didn't already own. In competing lawsuits, each side accused the other of manipulating Pilot's accounting in bad faith, with the Haslams saying Berkshire was undervaluing its stake, and Berkshire concerned it might overpay. Tensions had been rising earlier, after Berkshire took an 80% stake and replaced top Pilot management. Buffett tasked Abel to sort out the issue, and Olson said \"it was not pleasant going through the litigation.\" But both sides settled in January, and Berkshire paid $2.6 billion for the final 20% of Pilot. \"That was a problem that Warren put in Greg's lap,\" Olson said. \"His preparation and thinking was impressive. He is strategic in his thinking, and he is decisive in his judgment.\"\\ Berkshire also owns several insurers including Geico, the BNSF railroad, a slew of industrial and retail businesses, and hundreds of billions of dollars of stocks including Apple and Bank of America.

    "content": "MarketWatch reporter Venessa Wong explains how inflation jeopardizes the middle class. Plus, colleague Eleanor Laise breaks down the worrisome aspects of taking ketamine for depression without guidance. This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated. Jeremy Owens: Hello and welcome to On Watch by MarketWatch. I'm Jeremy Owens.\nA $100,000 salary no longer buys you a middle class lifestyle. That was the headline on a story last week from senior reporter Venessa Wong, and it sparked a lot of debate among MarketWatch readers. Today, Venessa comes on the show and explains why the inflation shock of recent years put the final stake in the middle class.\nThen we take a critical look at one of the hottest depression treatments in America. After the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry was partly blamed on ketamine, reporter Eleanor Laise dove into the world of ketamine therapy, which is quickly becoming a multi-billion dollar industry. She joins us to warn Americans about the dangers of at-home use of ketamine.\nPlus, we'll take a quick look at the news stories we're watching right now and how they will affect your wallet. First, let's talk about the middle class.\nThe inflation shock has left many middle income families unable to save what they need for the future or accomplish other financial goals that have long been considered anchors of the middle class lifestyle. MarketWatch senior personal finance reporter Venessa Wong reported on that last week and her story attracted more than a hundred comments and counting.\nBut rising inflation was only the final dagger in the back of the middle class. Venessa believes the high cost of three basic economic needs is what actually caused the dramatic effects of inflation, so I invited her on the show to break it down for us.\nWell, Venessa, your story last week sparked a lot of conversation and I wanted to bring that conversation to the podcast. And when I read your story, yeah, there's a lot of numbers in there, but I think there's one line that really brought it home for me and says exactly what you're trying to say here, and that was being middle income no longer affords a middle class quality of life in many parts of the US. Could you kind of explain that contention to me and how you came to that conclusion? Venessa Wong: Yeah, I mean this is such a personal topic for me and a lot of my peers. I think we've recognized that we are statistically doing well. Many of us are statistically falling somewhere in the middle of the income pay range in the US or in our markets, but still not feeling like it's easy or possible to get ahead. And it's a shocking realization that you may be doing okay or even slightly better than okay in many parts of the country right now, but still not be able to do more than cover your basic necessities. Jeremy Owens: And that's not what the middle class lifestyle has always been about. You need to be able to save for the future, you need to be able to enjoy yourself occasionally, but that's not what's happening right now from what you've seen. Venessa Wong: That's right. I mean, middle class typically conveys some sense of financial security and it also conveys some sense of being able to cover more than your needs, to cover some wants.\nThe Washington Post did a survey and that they identified six things that most people consider to be markers of a middle class quality of life, which are having a stable job, being able to save for the future, being able to afford a thousand dollar emergency without debt, being able to pay bills on time without worry, having health insurance and being able to retire comfortably. And doing all of those six things right now on a median income is very difficult. There are surveys that people who make low six figures, if you just kind of like eked past a hundred thousand dollars, it doesn't get you that far anymore.\nA lot of this is due to rising costs for housing, childcare, healthcare. These are big ticket items that eat up a lot of your monthly budget and don't leave very much for discretionary spending, for other necessary spending for that matter. There was a Zillow survey, for example, that showed that the typical family that's looking for a house right now would have to spend 66% of their income on their mortgage and childcare costs at the moment. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, and I want to really get into those three inputs you brought up there, housing, healthcare and childcare.\nNow, a lot of what we're discussing has come up since the big inflation shock of 2021, 2022. I mean, we're still dealing with inflation now. But those three inputs have been getting much more expensive for quite a while now. It was the inflation shock that, all of a sudden, really hit and people felt, but that inflation shock hit so hard to the middle class because the costs of housing, healthcare and childcare had come up so much over decades at that point. Venessa Wong: That's right. I mean, housing is very difficult right now if you're a renter or a buyer. If you're trying to buy a house right now, interest rates are very high. The costs of houses haven't really come down as interests has skyrocketed. Renters obviously continue to be sort of subject to the whims of their landlords, and it's also one of those things that becomes more difficult as you have children and your housing needs sort of expand. Jeremy Owens: And your childcare needs suddenly pop in. Venessa Wong: Correct. Jeremy Owens: When you're already paying a lot for childcare, healthcare, housing, all of a sudden, your grocery bill going up 20%, it's that much harder. And that's definitely what we've seen over the last couple of years.\nAnd just to give some numbers to it, the median income in the US for 2022 is just under $115,000, while you showed some numbers that a family with two adults and two children in large US cities now must spend more than $117,000 annually simply to cover basic needs. Venessa Wong: That's right. And we've seen for many years now, Americans taking on debt to cover basic expenses. There's so many ways to do that. Credit cards, personal loans, people are funding their educations with student loans. Mortgages are really expensive. So I just think like that the shortfall in our incomes is being made up by this growing debt burden, which has become really a very hot political topic, too, because I think we've reached the point where we are recognizing that this is a problem and one that's not sustainable, and we already are starting to see delinquencies rise again.\nAnd this is also in a climate where a lot of costs have continued to rise as well. One of the delinquencies that's up again now are auto delinquencies. The cost of cars have risen spectacularly over the past few years, and we're seeing that the average monthly auto payment is about $700 a month now, which is a lot more than it was before the pandemic. Auto insurance is up as well.\nSo just like the cost to do basic things in America, this isn't anything excessive. It's like where do I live, how do I get to work, how do I buy my food, how do I pay for medical bills have I become very big questions that are insurmountable for a lot of families. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, when I saw that figure, that 117.5K needed for a family of four to live in a large metro area, it actually seemed low to me, living in the San Francisco Bay Area where everything is so expensive, especially housing. Venessa Wong: It is, and it doesn't account for anything that you need for savings. It doesn't count for any unexpected expenses and it doesn't even account, for once, if you want to have a hobby or if you want your children to have a hobby, if you want to do anything besides sort of like daily survival, this estimate doesn't build in any costs for that.\nBut obviously millions of Americans are getting buy on about this much or less in many cases. And what's going on is that they are often compromising things that they need or compromising on things that they want or compromising on saving for the future in order to make all of it work. Jeremy Owens: Well, it would be good to see wages gain along with inflation. We actually have seen wages gain after a long period of stagnation in the last few years. But a lot of those wage gains have been to hourly workers on the lower rung of the salary scale, so that really hasn't helped the middle class that much. Venessa Wong: I think what we're seeing now, though, is that like getting beyond low income into middle income results, obviously, in some quality of life improvement, but not exactly what you would expect, right? And once you're part of this sort of like middle income band, you're still sort of facing a sense of financial precarity that is shocking for the amount of money that you're making.\nThere was a recent survey in which 48% of respondents who earn more than a hundred thousand dollars said they were living paycheck to paycheck, and that includes about a third of those who earn more than $200,000. But when you think about the cost of living in a lot of metro areas, this actually isn't that shocking. I think that people are still expecting that this money will buy them more lifestyle than they're actually getting, and it's because the costs just keep on escalating. And this is something that the Biden administration has talked about a lot in terms of corporate greed and greedflation. Jeremy Owens: Oh, yeah, Venessa, and greedflation is kind of my area because when we talk greedflation, what we're saying is that companies are using inflation to pad their profits. And I've done a lot of deep dives into the profit margins of the S&P 500 over the last three years, especially since we started seeing inflation in '21. Early on, we saw those margins expand for grocery companies and for fast food. And while those companies have upped their wages for the lower rung of the salary band in the past couple of years, they've seen those margins kind of contract again.\nWhere the margins are really fat right now is big tech and they laid off a lot of workers last year and, suddenly, the profits got huge. And the real danger now is that big tech is going to every other sector and telling them, \"Hey, guys, you know you can lay off some middle-income workers to help your profits up.\" And I know there are software salesmen right now in C Suites telling people, \"Hey, you can lay off six figure workers and just hire a couple of $50,000-a-year college grads and buy this AI software and they can do the same job.\"\nAnd that's where we're going to see a lot of real fear and there should be real fear over the next few years for middle class workers. Venessa Wong: There's so many things that are working against the middle band of the workforce, whether it's a focus on corporate profits, whether it's a focus on tech to reduce costs, and I think that's the sense of, emotionally anyway, psychologically precarity that a lot of people are feeling, which was part of what being middle class once symbolized in this country was having a sense of stability, having a sense of stable employment, which enables you to do all of those things, save for the future and afford an emergency and retire one day. And all of those things are just slowly being eroded. Jeremy Owens: And I don't see anything that's going to change that coming up. I mean, I feel like this is something we're going to have to continue talking about because it is the thing that everybody's going to get frustrated about. If you do everything right in your 20s and early 30s and you get to that point in your career where you're making six figures and you feel like you should be actually enjoying yourself after working so hard to get there, well, it's not what it was supposed to be. It's not what it's been in the past. Venessa Wong: That's right. There's been a lot of emphasis recently on positive economic metrics and how real incomes are up. So even though there's been record inflation, incomes have sort of made up for that in some way and we should be back to our pre-pandemic vibe because of that.\nTo which I would say two things. Vibes weren't great before the pandemic. I think there were a lot of cost-of-living pressures for middle-income people before we faced a global health crisis. And also I think we should always be evaluating who is enjoying economic growth. Because if there's anything that we've come out of the pandemic knowing and trying to keep in mind is that those gains are not evenly distributed. And so even while we're seeing low-income workers come away from this recovery with bigger gains in wages, we also saw them suffer the greatest losses at the beginning of the pandemic.\nI personally think it's politically dangerous to ignore these qualitative points of feedback that might be obscured by macroeconomic data. Jeremy Owens: Venessa, I do really appreciate the conversation. I appreciate that your story sparked this conversation. If you have not read the story, please go do so. And if you want to talk more about this, please hit us up at On Watch at marketwatch.com. You can reach out to Venessa independently as well to give her your story.\nThanks so much for joining us, Venessa. Venessa Wong: Thank you so much for having me. Jeremy Owens: We're going to take a quick break. Coming up, ketamine therapy. Stay with us.\nWelcome back to On Watch by MarketWatch. Before the break, we talked with Venessa Wong about her article on the middle class. Now we welcome MarketWatch healthcare reporter, Eleanor Laise to talk about a very important investigative story she recently published.\nKetamine is a powerful tranquilizer that has also been used as a recreational drug, but in recent years it has turned into something much different, a treatment for depression. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has admitted using the drug, saying it is helpful for getting one out of a negative frame of mind.\nBut ketamine was also a factor in the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry. And when Eleanor dug in, she found many other troubling anecdotes about the drug's usage. So we asked her to join us this week and talk about the multi-billion dollar industry and how to avoid the worst parts of it.\nWell, Eleanor, I've always known ketamine as a very powerful tranquilizer and a sometimes party drug named Special K. But how did it become like a trendy depression treatment? Eleanor Laise: That's right. This can be a really confusing area for patients right now because, like you say, ketamine is many things all at once. It's an FDA-approved anesthetic, which has been around for more than 50 years. It's a controlled substance that can have hallucinogenic effects and, as such, it's a party drug. But it's also increasingly popular as a mental health treatment even though it has not been approved by the FDA for that purpose. Jeremy Owens: Right. There is one nasal spray that's been approved by the FDA, esketamine, which is marketed by Johnson & Johnson as a nasal spray called Spravato, and that's a ketamine-derived drug that was approved in 2019.\nBut ketamine itself has not been approved for psychiatric use and that's really what people need to know is that no regulator has said, \"Yes, ketamine is good for depression and people should be using it.\" Eleanor Laise: Right. No, the FDA has certainly not said that about ketamine itself.\nWhat happened really was in recent decades there was research studying lower doses of ketamine, the sub-anesthetic doses, not the level that might knock you out before a major surgery, finding that those sub-anesthetic doses looked promising as a potential mental health treatment. So doctors started prescribing it for this off-label use, even though ketamine has not actually been approved for treatment of any psychiatric disorders.\nKetamine therapy has become quite a big business. I mean, over the past decade it has grown from virtually nothing to, by some estimates, roughly 1200 to 1500 ketamine clinics nationwide. The ketamine clinic market is valued at about 3.4 billion. Some ketamine therapy providers will offer in-person only treatments. In many cases, that means you're getting the ketamine through an IV with in-person preparation and aftercare from a clinician. Jeremy Owens: And that lines up with what I've heard about psychedelic treatment just in general, right? This is something that you want to do with somebody in a controlled environment. Eleanor Laise: Right, but we also have many providers that are offering online ketamine therapy where it's done more remotely. And the pandemic really helped spur the growth of the online therapy providers because the regulations on telehealth prescribing of controlled substances were relaxed during the COVID lockdowns. Jeremy Owens: But it's the at-home where you found a lot of people who had really bad experiences through telehealth and at-home administration of this drug, right? Eleanor Laise: Yeah, I mean there are some overarching concerns about whether we really have enough data on ketamine to arrive at firm conclusions, but particular concerns are being raised about at-home therapy for a number of reasons.\nA number of the experts I spoke with and the FDA itself have expressed a lot of discomfort with at-home ketamine use, first of all, the lack of in-person monitoring. Ketamine can cause changes in your blood pressure and heart rate. It causes, of course, sedation and dissociation. Over time, ketamine misuse can cause bladder damage.\nAnd getting back to this question of dosage, when you get treatments in a clinic, often those are the IV ketamine infusions and the dosing there can be a little bit more straightforward. At-home therapy in many cases involves ketamine lozenges or troches that dissolve slowly in your mouth. And the FDA has said that there's variation in the dosages of these oral compounded ketamine products that are marketed by telehealth platforms, making it hard to predict what risks might be associated with those treatments. Jeremy Owens: I think the most depressing anecdote you have in your story is about somebody who was going through the at-home in that way with the dissolvable ketamine lozenge, and was supposed to spit out what was left. And the person in the at-home therapy told them to swallow it, and they ended up with toxicity in their blood from too much ketamine, right? Eleanor Laise: Right. That person arrived at the emergency room unresponsive and was found to have a concentration of ketamine in her blood that was double the level typically used for general anesthesia. So there's definitely the potential for mistakes to be made, either by the patient or the provider.\nActually, one survey last year found that more than half of people who had tried at-home ketamine therapy had either accidentally or intentionally taken more than the recommended dose. Of course, mistakes can happen anywhere, but if you're in a clinical setting, at least there are providers on hand to help you.\nOne concern I've heard from some in the industry is that some prospective patients seem to be sort of price-shopping for ketamine, looking for the cheapest product they can find, but experts say that's really not a good idea.\nThere are a lot of other points to consider if you're really looking at this as a potential mental health treatment. Is this a provider who's going to give you ketamine no matter what, or is there a screening process and a thorough medical and psychiatric evaluation, determine whether ketamine is actually an appropriate treatment for you? Is this a very transactional process or is there going to be some sort of ongoing relationship between you and the practitioner? Are they going to follow up with you and discuss any side effects you experienced and whether it makes sense to continue the treatment?\nA large professional group of ketamine practitioners that's coming up with some new guidelines on ketamine therapy says they're not going to be recommending online-only business models that don't include that sort of ongoing relationship. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, and you spoke with somebody who had developed an at-home ketamine therapy startup business, and he had actually gotten out of the business and was very concerned about where it was headed, right? Eleanor Laise: Right. So he co-founded a mental health company that offered at-home ketamine therapy a few years ago, but he grew very uncomfortable for a few different reasons.\nHe sensed pressure from prospective investors to sort of maximize the profitability of patients. He felt there was sort a push toward longer term ketamine therapy, sort of regardless of whether that was the best thing for the patient. And again, the price shopping that he saw among some of the patients seemed to him, like he said, sort of a race to the bottom. Jeremy Owens: So just to break this down and make it as simple as possible for people, ketamine has not been approved for use for depression and the at-home ketamine therapy business has some issues right now that could make it dangerous for those who take part in it. Eleanor Laise: Right, and that's a very sharp contrast with the rules that the FDA has established for Spravato. The FDA has said you cannot take Spravato at home. It has to be done in a healthcare setting. Patients have to stay for at least two hours after each dose to be monitored for any adverse effects. So it's two very different worlds that exist here. Jeremy Owens: Right, right. Exactly. And I think, well, there might be even three, Eleanor, because you've got the nasal spray and then you've got the IV treatment that is very similar where you need to be in the clinic. And I think that's the one that first sprung up and you saw ketamine clinics all over the place.\nAnd then the pandemic allowed this to be done through telehealth, sent to people's homes, even though it's not FDA-approved. Are those rules in place forever? Is there anything that could push back against the telehealth ketamine industry? Eleanor Laise: So those more flexible rules that existed during the pandemic are still in place for right now. Officially, they are supposed to expire at the end of this year, but there are signs that it's quite likely they could be with us in some form for the longer term. Jeremy Owens: And that's because they're very useful for other drugs. A lot of ill people who find it troublesome to go out of the house, their lives have been made easier because of these rules. But not for ketamine, just in general. Eleanor Laise: Right. Nobody wants to really cut off access for someone who really needs a treatment. So the DEA has already said it's committed to the expansion of telemedicine and it's working on some new rules around this so stay tuned. We'll definitely be watching how that plays out. Jeremy Owens: For sure. And if somebody is considering using ketamine to treat their depression, their PTSD, whatever they may be facing, what would your suggestion to them be? Eleanor Laise: You're likely going to confront this choice between in-person therapy in a clinic and at-home therapy, and you want to consider all these risks that we've discussed in terms of how ketamine can impact your blood pressure, your heart rate, all those factors.\nAnd I would weigh the FDA's warnings about the compounded oral ketamine products and the variation in dosage and the unpredictability of potential side effects there. Some doctors say the doses available from some of these online providers are alarmingly high, higher than what they themselves would offer a patient through an IV when they're monitoring them in-person in a clinic. But we want to acknowledge that affordability and accessibility are important issues. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, it could cost thousands of dollars per session, right? Nothing about ketamine is usually covered by healthcare because it is not FDA-approved. Maybe Spravato is the one thing that you could possibly see getting covered by some form of healthcare. Eleanor Laise: There's some spotty coverage even of ketamine therapy itself, but the odds are a lot of patients are going to be paying out of pocket. So you want to evaluate, of course, not just the price, but all the services that come with it, the group therapy, the education, the follow-up consultations. So I would weigh all of that. Jeremy Owens: This is a situation where you do not want to hunt for the best price. You want to make sure that you're being treated in the way that you need to be treated to get better. Eleanor Laise: Right. It may seem tempting, but I would really weigh all the other services that are going to wrap around that part of your mental health treatment. Jeremy Owens: Well, Eleanor, thank you so much for coming on here and bringing this important story to us. Please read Eleanor's story to get more and thank you so much, Eleanor. We'll have you on again. Eleanor Laise: Thank you. Jeremy Owens: Before we go, it's time for What We Are Watching, a look at the news you need to know for the rest of the week and beyond.\nStarbucks and McDonald's executives said this week that customers are beginning to scrutinize their discretionary purchases more closely this year. That could be troubling news for the economy, which has been supported in recent years by surprisingly strong consumer spending. With two of the most widespread US chains reporting a pullback in the first three months of the year, fears are growing about the effects of years-long inflation on Americans' wallets and spending habits.\nBerkshire Hathaway will hold its annual meeting on Saturday, an event that has become quite the party for Warren Buffett and his company. But this year's event may be more somber as it will be the first since the death of Buffett's longtime compatriot, Charlie Munger. Still, Buffett's annual letter outlining his thoughts on the current state of investing and the economy, which he has issued for nearly 60 years in a row now, will make news this weekend.\nThe Monthly Jobs Report will be released tomorrow. And if you couldn't tell from our discussion about wages and layoffs, it will be crucial to understanding the current state of the US economy. After the federal government reported recently that gross domestic product declined in the first quarter while inflation began growing again, there are concerns about stagflation floating around, which this report could dispute or bolster. We'll talk more about that next week.\nAnd that's it for this episode. Thanks to Venessa Wong and Eleanor Laise. You can subscribe to the show wherever you get your podcasts and please do. If you like what you heard, please leave us a rating or review. It really helps others discover the show. And let us know what you want to hear from us. You can reach us at On Watch at marketwatch.com.\nThe show is hosted by me, Jeremy Owens, and produced by Mette Lützhøft and Isaac Gaines, who also makes this episode. Melissa Haggerty is the executive producer. We'll be back next week with a new episode and, until then, we'll be watching.

    "description": "Pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University demanded the school drop any investments in companies doing business in Israel.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-02T21:24:58Z",
    "content": "Pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University yelled “disclose, divest, we will not stop” as they broke into Hamilton Hall earlier this week, demanding the school drop any investments in companies doing business in Israel. But shedding those stakes first requires identifying them, and even that step — disclosure — can get tricky fast, higher education finance experts say. Many large university endowments are murkily set up with thousands of individual funds that have their own rules on how they’re invested, few requirements to share their investments publicly, and third-party managers whose oversight of day-to-day trading can limit campus officials’ knowledge of their own schools’ portfolios. “I think a lot of people believe an endowment is a piggy bank, and it’s not,” said Bill Guerrero, chief financial officer at the University of Bridgeport, a private university in Connecticut. School endowments are typically composed of many smaller funds, each with their own purposes, said Scott Malpass, who served for over three decades as the chief investment officer at the University of Notre Dame, a private Catholic institution outside of South Bend, Indiana, with nearly 9,000 students. During his tenure, which concluded with his 2020 retirement, the market value of the school’s endowment pool — a collection of several thousand distinct funds — grew from over $450 million in 1988 to more than $13.8 billion by the end of fiscal year 2019. “The big endowments have tried to improve on that in the last 20 to 30 years,” Malpass said of investment transparency, suggesting there may be room in some cases to go further. The University of Bridgeport, with nearly $42 million in assets and fewer than 2,000 students, has individual fund agreements numbering in the hundreds, said Guerrero, in which donors can specify how they’d like their contributions invested. A given fund might, for example, be earmarked solely for environmentally friendly investments. What’s more, many of these agreed-upon rules of investment are confidential, Guerrero said: “It’s very, very restrictive.” Student demonstrators have seized on this opacity as part of their broader divestment push. “It has been impossible to get Columbia to fully disclose their entire investment portfolio despite efforts from not just student organizers, but concerned faculty,” the Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine said in an Instagram post last week. “They have refused transparency for far too long.” The university has rejected calls to divest from Israel and instead offered to “publish a process for students to access a list of Columbia’s direct investment holdings, and to increase the frequency of updates to that list of holdings.” But direct investments rarely reflect the full scope of an institution’s portfolio. Many resemble a series of matryoshka dolls, in which some component funds that may not directly hold certain Israeli stocks could still have indirect ties to the country, for instance through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that themselves may have exposure to Israel. What’s more, universities tend to be mum about which asset management firms they hire to handle their investments — both direct and indirect ones. The Knight Foundation reached out to 50 U.S. colleges with some of the largest endowments last year, asking them to share details about the share of their funds managed by firms with diverse leadership. Only 18 participated fully, and eight others opted to self-report more limited data. “Even as public-facing institutions, universities historically are not transparent about their financial affairs,” the researchers concluded. “There’s no incentive” for institutions to share more details about their investments, Malpass acknowledged. Many institutions worry that publicizing too much information could allow others to copy their investment strategies or scare away asset managers that prefer keeping their client lists private. By law, nonprofits like university endowments are required to report some information annually on the Internal Revenue Service’s Form 990. The document outlines the broad mix of assets (i.e., stocks versus bonds) that an endowment has invested in, but it doesn’t require granular detail on specific companies or industries those investments are focused on. Many school endowment officers also publish their own annual reports to help students, faculty, alumni and donors understand how money has flown in and out of their portfolios over a given year. But these reports are optional, leaving it mostly up to university administrators to decide how much additional information to publicize. Institutions with assets exceeding $100 million are also required to report holdings every three months through 13F filings, which are mandated by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. But those snapshots aren’t comprehensive; for example, Columbia University’s endowment reported $13.6 billion in assets in June of last year, but 13F filings detailed only $68 million of those holdings, which include stakes in various therapeutics companies as well as Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. With just 0.5% of the portfolio covered by 13F filings, the remaining 99.5% is outlined only in much broader strokes on the school’s Form 990. In a statement to NBC News, Columbia University spokesperson Robert Hornsby said “we don’t share direct holdings beyond what is filed publicly, and nor do we disclose investment manager information.” The complexity of endowment funds hasn’t stopped universities from making divestments in the past. Three years ago, several large schools agreed to reduce ties with the fossil fuel industry following students’ climate change protests. An investment policy guiding Columbia’s endowment now lists fossil fuels, thermal coal, private prison operators and tobacco as restricted industries. Malpass, who restricted some exposure to drillers and oil exploration companies during his time at Notre Dame, said divesting stock holdings “isn’t challenging at all.” Many could be sold in a day, he said, though private investments could take longer to exit. Some argue that even a widespread divestment push across American higher education, which seems unlikely, would have little impact on the war in Gaza. “Corporate decisions are going to make a much bigger statement than divestment from a university endowment ever would,” said Chris Marsicano, the director of the College Crisis Initiative at Davidson College, a small liberal arts school in North Carolina. Others have warned that selling shares of Israeli firms at a cheap price could benefit investors who support the country, noting that boycotts of goods tend to exert greater pressure than boycotts of stocks. There’s also the risk that pro-Palestinian divestment efforts could trigger an exodus of deep-pocketed university donors with countervailing sympathies. Even so, Marsicano noted that pro-Palestinian campus protests are getting the attention of the Israeli government, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denouncing them in an address last week. “Divestment is definitely the vehicle to keep the protests going,” he said, “rather than the financial implications of divestment.” This article was originally published on NBCNews.com Sign in to create a watchlist"

A given fund might, for example, be earmarked solely for environmentally friendly investments. What’s more, many of these agreed-upon rules of investment are confidential, Guerrero said: “It’s very, very restrictive.” Student demonstrators have seized on this opacity as part of their broader divestment push. “It has been impossible to get Columbia to fully disclose their entire investment portfolio despite efforts from not just student organizers, but concerned faculty,” the Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine said in an Instagram post last week. “They have refused transparency for far too long.” The university has rejected calls to divest from Israel and instead offered to “publish a process for students to access a list of Columbia’s direct investment holdings, and to increase the frequency of updates to that list of holdings.” But direct investments rarely reflect the full scope of an institution’s portfolio. Many resemble a series of matryoshka dolls, in which some component funds that may not directly hold certain Israeli stocks could still have indirect ties to the country, for instance through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that themselves may have exposure to Israel. What’s more, universities tend to be mum about which asset management firms they hire to handle their investments — both direct and indirect ones. The Knight Foundation reached out to 50 U.S. colleges with some of the largest endowments last year, asking them to share details about the share of their funds managed by firms with diverse leadership. Only 18 participated fully, and eight others opted to self-report more limited data. “Even as public-facing institutions, universities historically are not transparent about their financial affairs,” the researchers concluded. “There’s no incentive” for institutions to share more details about their investments, Malpass acknowledged. Many institutions worry that publicizing too much information could allow others to copy their investment strategies or scare away asset managers that prefer keeping their client lists private. By law, nonprofits like university endowments are required to report some information annually on the Internal Revenue Service’s Form 990. The document outlines the broad mix of assets (i.e., stocks versus bonds) that an endowment has invested in, but it doesn’t require granular detail on specific companies or industries those investments are focused on. Many school endowment officers also publish their own annual reports to help students, faculty, alumni and donors understand how money has flown in and out of their portfolios over a given year. But these reports are optional, leaving it mostly up to university administrators to decide how much additional information to publicize. Institutions with assets exceeding $100 million are also required to report holdings every three months through 13F filings, which are mandated by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. But those snapshots aren’t comprehensive; for example, Columbia University’s endowment reported $13.6 billion in assets in June of last year, but 13F filings detailed only $68 million of those holdings, which include stakes in various therapeutics companies as well as Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. With just 0.5% of the portfolio covered by 13F filings, the remaining 99.5% is outlined only in much broader strokes on the school’s Form 990. In a statement to NBC News, Columbia University spokesperson Robert Hornsby said “we don’t share direct holdings beyond what is filed publicly, and nor do we disclose investment manager information.” The complexity of endowment funds hasn’t stopped universities from making divestments in the past. Three years ago, several large schools agreed to reduce ties with the fossil fuel industry following students’ climate change protests. An investment policy guiding Columbia’s endowment now lists fossil fuels, thermal coal, private prison operators and tobacco as restricted industries. Malpass, who restricted some exposure to drillers and oil exploration companies during his time at Notre Dame, said divesting stock holdings “isn’t challenging at all.” Many could be sold in a day, he said, though private investments could take longer to exit. Some argue that even a widespread divestment push across American higher education, which seems unlikely, would have little impact on the war in Gaza. “Corporate decisions are going to make a much bigger statement than divestment from a university endowment ever would,” said Chris Marsicano, the director of the College Crisis Initiative at Davidson College, a small liberal arts school in North Carolina. Others have warned that selling shares of Israeli firms at a cheap price could benefit investors who support the country, noting that boycotts of goods tend to exert greater pressure than boycotts of stocks. There’s also the risk that pro-Palestinian divestment efforts could trigger an exodus of deep-pocketed university donors with countervailing sympathies. Even so, Marsicano noted that pro-Palestinian campus protests are getting the attention of the Israeli government, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denouncing them in an address last week. “Divestment is definitely the vehicle to keep the protests going,” he said, “rather than the financial implications of divestment.” Brian Cheung is a business and data correspondent for NBC News. © 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL"

Following a lunch break in Trump's hush-money trial Thursday, Necheles said she had \"a stack of news articles\" from people like Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley. The attorney asked if Trump would be allowed to share the articles on social media despite a limited gag order that prevents him from talking about potential witnesses, the jury, court staff, or their families. \"We think that they are perfectly fine,\" Necheles told the judge. \"It seems odd that they're asking the court for an advanced ruling,\" one prosecutor chimed in.

Embora Buffett não estará sozinho no palco, é provável que os diálogos não sejam tão sarcásticos ou acalorados. Greg Abel, que é responsável pelas operações não relacionadas a seguros da Berkshire e considerado o provável sucessor de Buffett na posição de CEO, deverá se juntar a Buffett neste final de semana, ao lado de Ajit Jain, encarregado do negócio de seguros.

Mas, tradicionalmente, a maioria queria ouvir o que Buffett e Munger tinham a dizer sobre investimentos e o clima atual. “Charlie e eu somos sem vergonha”, escreveu Buffett em sua carta aos acionistas no ano passado. “Ano passado, em nossa primeira reunião de acionistas em três anos, recebemos vocês com nossa habitual agitação comercial. Logo do início, fomos diretamente à sua carteira. Em pouco tempo, nosso quiosque da See’s vendeu onze toneladas de nutritivos pés-de-moleque e chocolates. Em nosso discurso, mais parecido com uma fala de P.T. Barnum, prometemos longevidade. Afinal, além dos doces da See’s, o que mais poderia explicar o fato de Charlie e eu termos chegado aos 99 e 92 anos?Munger faleceu dias antes de completar 100 anos de idade. Ele e Buffett se conheceram quando ambos trabalhavam em uma mercearia do avô de Buffett enquanto ainda adolescentes, mas só vieram a perceber isso em 1959. Entretanto, foi só em 1978, quando Munger assumiu o cargo de vice-presidente da Berkshire Hathaway, que os dois começaram a fazer magia.“O projeto que ele me deu era simples: Esqueça o que você sabe sobre comprar negócios justos a preços maravilhosos; em vez disso, compre negócios maravilhosos a preços justos”, escreveu Buffett na carta aos acionistas da empresa em 2015.  “Mudar meu comportamento não é tarefa fácil (pergunte à minha família). Eu já havia alcançado sucesso razoável sem a contribuição de Charlie, então por que deveria dar ouvidos a um advogado que nunca passou um dia sequer na escola de administração (sendo que, bem, eu compareci a três). Mas Charlie nunca se cansou de repetir suas máximas sobre negócios e investimentos para mim, e sua lógica era irrefutável. Assim sendo, a Berkshire foi construída com base no modelo de Charlie.”Na carta aos acionistas de fevereiro, Buffett prestou homenagem ao seu sócio: “Charlie nunca quis crédito por seu papel como criador; em vez disso, deixou-me fazer as reverências e receber os elogios. De certa forma, seu relacionamento comigo era em parte um de irmão mais velho, em parte um de pai amoroso. …Embora eu esteja há muito tempo no comando da equipe de construção, Charlie deveria sempre receber o crédito de ser o arquiteto.” Continua depois da publicidade NYT: ©.2024 The New York Times Company \n                                        Henrique Esteter revela os bastidores da conferência da Berkshire Hathaway, o evento que transforma uma pacata cidade dos EUA na capital mundial do mercado financeiro                                     \n                                        \"Oráculo de Omaha\" enfatizou que futuro CEO da Berkshire não vai dividir responsabilidades sobre onde alocar os recursos                                    "

    "content": "Keeping Current Matters CEO David Childers and Jimmy Burgess discuss why a relevant market opinion based on facts, not fears, is key for educating consumers and navigating industry changes. Inman Connect  May is Commission and Compensation Month here at Inman. We’ll sort through the noise and misinformation and provide you with the most up-to-date facts and strategies about how to prosper in the wake of the commission settlements. And look for straight-to-your inbox updates with Inman’s new weekly digest, Commission Chronicles. Success begins with an understanding of what is happening and a belief that you can provide clients with the information they need to make the best decision possible for themselves. David Childers, CEO of Keeping Current Matters, is here to share action steps and talking points to recalibrate you to a mindset for success. Childers began by saying, “Mindset is probably the biggest battle agents are facing right now [with] everything that has come out from the [National Association of Realtors] settlement and the questions about how things will look when the anticipated changes go into effect. “This leads to the question, who are you listening to? Are you listening to the media, to the people who are fearful, or are you focusing on the facts? Because when you start to look at the facts, they tell a different story than what is often being told. Who you listen to sets the mindset you have and the actions you take, so be careful who you are listening to.” Childers shared that the first step in creating a mindset for success is to develop a relevant market opinion based on the facts. Childers said, “The questions will come. ‘Are prices going down? What do you think about mortgage rates? What do you think is going to happen over the next six months?'” You will answer these questions in one of two ways. The first is “I don’t know,” or “We will have to wait and see.” The second is, “Can I share with you a few things I’ve found, and what I believe will happen?” When you have this relevant market opinion based on facts, it is no longer your opinion versus their opinion. It’s their opinion versus the facts. He suggested agents utilize data to provide prospects with the best information possible. He broke the frequently asked questions into three categories, including pricing, number of transactions and interest rates. Childers said all agents should be aware of current pricing trends. “Although prices on the local level can vary from national averages, the seven forecasters we follow at Keeping Current Matters have an expectation this year for an average appreciation nationally of about 2.5 percent. But these forecasts range from flat to 5 percent appreciation. Agents need to understand both the national and local numbers when it comes to pricing. Forming an opinion based on the local pricing trends is critical to success for agents, but when a prospective buyer or seller turns on the TV at night, they are educated at the national level.  So here is what you want to say: “You may have heard this about home prices on the national level, but let me share with you what we are seeing at the local level as well.” At that point, share this slide on the national numbers along with your printed data on the local level.  The ability to show how steady price appreciation can build equity is another way agents can be educators and provide a professional perspective for buyers. This chart shows the estimated home price performance over the next five years from Fannie Mae’s Home Price Expectations Survey.  Although showing these percentages can be helpful, visually showing what those projections could mean in terms of home equity can be even more valuable. This next slide shows the potential growth in equity over the next five years based on the purchase of a $400,000 home in January 2024 and the price appreciation projected by the Home Price Expectations Survey.  An agent’s ability to have a relevant opinion on pricing that is based on facts is exactly what prospective buyers need in today’s environment,” Childers said. The next area we discussed was the number of home sales forecast for 2024. Childers said, “The forecasts range from an estimated 4.9 million homes to be sold in 2024 to 5.4 million homes to be sold as the chart shows. This year will be a year filled with transactions; the question is how much of the market share are you going to grab?”  When asked about mortgage rates and their effect on the number of transactions, Childers said, “The current market is a demand-based rate environment. We believe 6.5 percent is sort of the dividing line between limited to weak demand and good to strong demand.  Most consumers realize it’s extremely unlikely that we would see what we saw two years ago with 3 percent rates on 30-year mortgages, so there are a couple of things we look at to evaluate what the future holds.  We watch what economists are saying regarding the 10-year Treasury note rates and what the Fed is saying about the timing of anticipated cuts to the Fed Funds Rate. Based on what economists are saying, we anticipate a better rate environment in the second half of the year. Most of the projections show improvement with an expectation of rates being in the 6 percent range by the end of the year, probably in the 6.5 percent range.  Based on sharing this information with prospective buyers, they will often say, “Great, then we will just wait for the rates to come down.” But that is what everyone else is saying as well. This could lead to increased pricing and an increase in the competition to buy the homes that are for sale at that time.  “Based on this, it might be wise for buyers to buy that home now instead of waiting for an anticipated drop in rates and increased competition for a limited number of homes for sale.”  “In our world, everything has changed, and nothing has changed. Things have changed regarding the NAR settlement and things that impact the way we do our business. But nothing has changed relative to our need to be an educator. Nothing has changed relative to our need to be out in the market with a relevant market opinion based on facts. If anything, the value of being an educator has risen over the past several months and in the last year. So, our job is to be active in our local markets and to share the facts versus what someone’s opinion might be,” Childers said. “When a question comes up about the market our ability to share exactly what’s happening will be the difference maker. This is a time when people want to know: Do you know what is happening, and can you give them good advice? This takes the pressure off us as well because we don’t have to convince them to do anything. We simply provide them with the best information possible so they can make the best decision possible for themselves and their family.” Jimmy Burgess is the CEO for Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Beach Properties of Florida in Northwest Florida.

Inman Connect  May is Commission and Compensation Month here at Inman. We’ll sort through the noise and misinformation and provide you with the most up-to-date facts and strategies about how to prosper in the wake of the commission settlements. And look for straight-to-your inbox updates with Inman’s new weekly digest, Commission Chronicles. In a departure from most commission lawsuits filed in recent months by homesellers, a new class action lawsuit was filed on Monday in Florida against HomeServices of America by homebuyers who allege that HomeServices and other members of the National Association of Realtors fixed commissions, which misled buyers and resulted in buyers paying inflated home prices. A similar case known as Batton 1 was filed against the firm in Illinois in February by homebuyers, but HomeServices was dismissed from the case because none of the company’s constituents are Illinois-based and plaintiffs did not submit a claim that would assert nationwide authority in the case. The lawsuit filed on Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida names James Lutz as the plaintiff who bought a home in Key Colony, Florida, in 2021 using a buyer agent who is affiliated with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, one of HomeServices of America’s franchisees. The lawsuit is seeking class-action status that will include buyers nationwide who bought MLS-listed homes starting on December 1, 1996. “For decades, homebuyers across America have been unwittingly paying too much for, and receiving too little from, services offered to them by Defendants and other real estate agent members of National Association of Realtors (‘NAR’),” the complaint states. “Despite agent representations (which NAR permits and encourages) that such services do not cost homebuyers anything, homebuyers in fact pay a hefty cost for these services — namely, supracompetitive commissions at levels fixed by the Defendants, NAR; and other real estate brokers, which in turn lead to higher home prices paid by buyers.” The suit goes on to allege that the cost to consumers, as a result of the so-called fixed prices, was “enormous,” claiming that “experts have suggested that the amount of ‘annual broker fees consumers might save if there was effective price competition is as much as $30 billion or more annually.'” Chris Kelly (Credit: Ebby Halliday) Meanwhile, HomeServices has denied any wrongdoing or anticompetitive behavior and argued that the alleged damages contradicts those asserted in and accepted by the jury in the Burnett case, Real Estate News reported. “While we are just beginning to analyze this buyer antitrust case that was filed immediately on the heels of our settlement of the Burnett action, we maintain our position that HomeServices’ conduct and business practices were at all times lawful and procompetitive,” HomeServices of America Executive Vice President Chris Kelly told Real Estate News. “We also note that Plaintiffs’ theory of damages in this follow-on lawsuit is directly at odds with the damages theory accepted by the jury in the Burnett case and could potentially result in a duplicative recovery that would be unfair, unjust and violative of HomeServices’ rights,” Kelly added. NAR’s “Free Service Rule,” which in the past, had allowed buyers’ agents to represent their services as free of cost, and which the lawsuit also takes issue with, was eliminated in 2022. NAR’s policy change at that time stated, “MLS participants and subscribers must not represent their brokerage services to a client or customer are free or available at no cost to clients, unless the participant or subscriber will receive no financial compensation from any source for those services.” Email Lillian Dickerson Simply enter the email address you used to create your account and click \"Reset Password\".

The expansion observed in the historical period can be attributed to factors such as demographic changes, economic stability, increased risk perception among individuals, and product innovation in the insurance market.The market is expected to see further steady growth, reaching $11246.74 billion in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.7%. The anticipated growth in the forecast period can be attributed to global economic trends, concerns related to climate change, regulatory changes affecting the insurance landscape, emerging risks in various sectors, and infrastructure development. Key trends expected in the forecast period include the integration of sustainable and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations, growth in parametric insurance, applications of blockchain technology in the insurance industry, and the use of remote risk assessment tools.The anticipated increase in insurance penetration is poised to propel the growth of the life and non-life insurance market in the coming years. Insurance penetration denotes the extent of insurance coverage, representing the percentage of the population or businesses with insurance policies in relation to the total insurable market or population. This surge in insurance penetration holds significant advantages for both life and non-life insurance sectors, fostering heightened financial protection, risk mitigation, and overall market stability. These benefits accrue to individuals, businesses, and the broader economy. Notably, in 2021, according to data from the Insurance Information Institute, life insurance premiums in the US witnessed an 11.5% increase, reaching $159.5 billion. Additionally, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development reported an 11.2% rise in insurance penetration in Sweden in 2021. Consequently, the upward trend in insurance penetration is expected to drive growth in the life and non-life insurance market.The growth of the life and non-life insurance market is set to receive a boost from the increasing global population. The global population encompasses the total number of people inhabiting the Earth at a specific point in time, spanning individuals from all countries, regions, and continents. The expanding global population not only diversifies the market for insurance products but also presents insurers with opportunities to tailor offerings to meet the evolving needs of a dynamic and growing population. In July 2022, a report by the United Nations projected the global population to reach approximately 8.5 billion by 2030, with a further increase to 9.7 billion by 2050. Subsequently, a peak population of around 10.4 billion individuals is anticipated during the 2080s. Thus, the rising global population is a key driver behind the growth of the life and non-life insurance market.Technological advancements emerge as a prominent trend gaining traction in the life and non-life insurance market. Major companies operating in this market are actively developing new technological solutions to bolster their positions. For example, in March 2023, Sure Insurance LLC, a US-based digital insurance provider, introduced Retrace - an e-commerce solution. This innovative technology enables online retailers to seamlessly offer clients integrated one-click insurance and protection. Featuring a set of APIs (application programming interfaces), Retrace facilitates the integration of security and insurance for various use cases, including the groundbreaking Retrace Return Shipping Protection, which enhances the online purchasing experience for both consumers and retailers.Major companies in the life and non-life insurance market are at the forefront of developing innovative products, such as indexed variable universal life (Indexed VUL) insurance, to cater to larger customer bases, drive sales, and increase revenue. Indexed VUL insurance combines features from both variable universal life (VUL) insurance and indexed universal life (IUL) insurance.The report covers market characteristics, size and growth, segmentation, regional and country breakdowns, competitive landscape, market shares, trends and strategies for this market.

    "description": "The first Saturday of May marks two significant events: the Kentucky Derby and the annual meeting for Berkshire Hathaway.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-02T12:00:00Z",
    "content": "LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY - MAY 07:  Jockey Sonny Leon aboard Rich Strike celebrates after Rich Strike ... [+] won the 148th running at Churchill Downs on May 07, 2022 in Louisville, Kentucky. (Photo by Andy Lyons/Getty Images) The first Saturday of May marks two significant events: the Kentucky Derby and the annual meeting for Berkshire Hathaway. Despite their apparent differences, these events share striking similarities. Both attract massive, passionate crowds and are steeped in tradition. Moreover, they offer participants the potential to turn a profit, whether through winning bets or from successful investments. The age-old question for investors and horse racing enthusiasts alike is: do you pick the horse or the jockey? As Warren Buffett famously quipped, when a CEO with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with poor economics, the reputation of the business remains intact. The same applies to jockeys and horses. Legendary jockey Willie Shoemaker riding a show pony would never have won a race. Similarly, one of Buffett's all-time favorite CEOs, Tom Murphy, who ran Capital Cities/ABC (which later merged with Disney), would likely have struggled in a declining industry like buggy whips. However, when you combine a great CEO with a good business or a great jockey with a high-quality horse, magic happens – winning races for horse racing fans and great returns for shareholders. This year's Kentucky Derby features legendary jockey John Velazquez riding the odds-on favorite, Fierceness. Velazquez has won the Kentucky Derby three times before: in 2011 with Animal Kingdom, in 2017 with Always Dreaming, and in 2020 with Authentic. A win this year would tie him with Willie Shoemaker for the third-most wins, behind only Eddie Arcaro and Bill Hartack, who each have five victories. The role of a skilled jockey on a high-performing horse is analogous to that of a great CEO leading a successful company. Just as a talented jockey can guide a horse to victory, a competent CEO can steer a company towards success. Both must make critical decisions under pressure, adapt to changing circumstances, and optimize their assets to achieve the best possible outcome. Buffett has a stable of great CEOs who run businesses that Berkshire Hathaway owns completely or has minority positions in. Some are well-known, like James Quincey, who leads Coca-Cola\nCoca-Cola\n, or Todd Combs, CEO of GEICO. Others, like Pat Egan, who runs See's Candies, may be less famous but are equally talented. Horse racing involves substantial strategy and competition, with jockeys making split-second decisions and trainers meticulously preparing horses for each race. The ability to quickly recover from mistakes is also crucial. Buffett now readily admits that buying a faltering textile operation named Berkshire Hathaway was a poor decision. However, his longtime partner, Charlie Munger (who passed away in December at age 99), advised him on how to fix the mistake. The key, Munger said, was to \"give up buying fair businesses at wonderful prices\" and instead add \"wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices\" to Berkshire's portfolio. This year's Kentucky Derby features two first-time jockeys: Keith Asmussen, riding Just Steel, and Ryusei Sakai, riding Forever Young. Asmussen, the 25-year-old son of Hall of Fame trainer Steve Asmussen, will participate in his first Derby after less than two years of full-time riding. Sakai, a rising star in Japan, may bring good karma to the race, given Berkshire's success in Japan in recent years. While Warren Buffett won't be at Churchill Downs on Saturday, he will have his two favorite \"jockeys\" on stage with him at the Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting in Omaha: Greg Abel, who runs Berkshire's non-insurance operations and is in line to succeed Buffett as CEO, and Ajit Jain, who heads the insurance business. The author, a long time Berkshire Hathaway shareholder, favors the Japanese horse Forever Young to win Saturday's Kentucky Derby. He will attend the Berkshire annual meeting in Omaha with an eye toward Louisville.  One Community.

    "content": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. \n\t\tThanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.\t Thousands of fans line up outside for hours, there’s expensive merchandise and even a secret movie. When 40,000 people descend on Omaha, Nebraska, Saturday, it might sound like a Taylor Swift concert or a Coachella-style festival. Instead they will sit rapturously for five hours listening to a 93-year-old man answering questions on the economy — but not just any man: billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Welcome to the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting, dubbed “Woodstock for capitalism” and compared by attendees to going to church or seeing The Beatles live. Inside the CHI Health Center Omaha, ordinary shareholders mingle with celebrities — such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill Murray and Glenn Close — and the biggest names in business, including Bill Gates, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, and Apple’s Tim Cook.  The annual pilgrimage to Omaha is the most fanatical followers of Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, America’s 7th largest company, which owns companies including Geico, Dairy Queen, BNSF Railway and NetJets, and large stakes in Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz and Chevron.  The cost of admission is as low as $396, a single Berkshire Hathaway class B share, but the wisdom dispensed by the man with a net worth of $132 billion is, say attendees, priceless. Christopher Bloomstran has attended every year since 2000 — except once, when his daughter was born two weeks before the meeting— and calls it the “highlight of each year.” “I’ve met some of my best friends in the investment arena at the Berkshire,” said Bloomstran, who is chief investment officer of Semper Augustus Investments Group  in St. Louis, Missouri.  “I go Wednesday and often stay until Monday.”  Adam Mead, who runs Mead Capital Management and has been going for 10 years said: “I don’t go to church but it’s like church: You know what the message will be, it’s the same stories, and you hear current events through the lens of timeless wisdom. “Bill Gates is out there as is Jamie Dimon — he shook my hand and took a pic. One time Warren shook my hand. That was a memorable moment.” The weekend begins Friday when Omaha’s Conference Center opens for conference-goers to pick up credentials for the festivities which include the meeting, a picnic and a 5K. (Buffett does not take part.) But the event’s core is Saturday when Buffett and other Berkshire leaders address the crowd, many of whom arrive at 3am. Chris Fried, an attorney from Pennsylvania, who will be attending for the 10th time always stays in walking distance of the conference center so he is in line by 3AM and prepared for the “mad dash” for the best seats once the doors open and shareholders flood in.  “By 4am – I would say the line is about 100 feet deep,” he said. “By 7 am – it is down several blocks.” Fried said he stumbled on Berkshire when he first read Warren’s annual letter to shareholders 20 years ago.  “It read like beautiful poetry to me and I purchased my first B shares within the week. I haven’t looked back.” In the line he has met Buffett fans from as far afield as Australia, as well as Japan, China, Germany and the UK, many of whom have become friends. “You never know who you’ll bump into,” Friend adds. “One year I sat next to two NFL players.” Mead said: “I’ve made some of my really good friends out there just standing in line. I’m staying in an Airbnb with some of them this year.”  By 8:45AM attendees are ready for Buffett’s annual film which opens the event and which is never seen outside the hall.  Only two still images have ever leaked. One, in 2015, was a pastiche of “Breaking Bad,” with Buffett appearing with Bryan Cranston, its star, to cook, not meth, but See’s Candy, one of the brands which has made Buffett rich. Another, in 2002, was Buffett playing the ukelele.  “He has done skits with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bryan Cranston, Manny Pacquiao, and Jamie Lee Curtis,” Mac Sykes, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Equity Trust, who has been attending for 15 years said. “They’re worth arriving early for.”  This year will be different in part because Charlie Munger, Berkshire’s vice chair and Buffett’s on-stage sidekick until he died at 99 last November, won’t be there for the first time. Elie-Chakib Abou-Chacra, a portfolio manager from Canada who is attending for the second time, said the annual meeting is the equivalent of being a Beatles fan seeing McCartney perform onstage.  “I get to see my hero on stage… if you’re a fan of McCartney or an old rock guy you never know when it will be his last tour but you know you want to see them onstage before they go.” Off stage, the conference center features specialized merch from companies owned by Berkshire, including Squishmallow — who sell a Warren Buffett version of their plush toy — Brooks Sports, Fruit of the Loom, and Dairy Queen.  Buffett tours by golf cart, with people taking selfies as he passes. They also take photos with cutouts of him dotted around the floor. Last year See’s Candies sold Buffett’s fans 11 tons of confectionery which included “Warren’s Favorite Chocolate Walnut Fudge.” Stephen Tedder, an ophthalmologist from Atlanta, told The Post that he fell in love with Buffett’s wisdom after he stumbled on a Berkshire report during the 2008 financial crisis.  “You could see the authentic Midwest moral fiber of Warren and Charlie [Munger], their clarity of thought, written word and plain speak,” he told The Post. This will be his third meeting, having started coming in 2022, because he made a “growing number of good friends.”  Women make up just 20% of attendees, sources told The Post. April Samuelson, a tech worker from Chicago, has attended twice and each time had to explain why she was there solo. “The weird thing about attending as a woman is other investors tended to assume that I was a wife or girlfriend,” Samuelson said.  “I had to clarify that I had stock of my own. When asked why, I just went with ‘I like money.’” Advertisement"

    "content": "Fund next-gen business journalism with $10 a month Search Free Newsletters Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is hosting its annual shareholders meeting Friday through Sunday. The conference, dubbed “Woodstock for Capitalists” by its fans, is a three-day event hosted in Buffett’s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. It’s full of luxurious experiences for Berkshire shareholders, including cocktails, shopping for exclusive jewelry and furniture from top designers, and lots of Dairy Queen (which is owned by Berkshire). But shareholders come for more than just the enticing perks. They wait all year to attend the highly-watched conference for a chance to hear directly from Buffett, known as the Oracle of Omaha. This year, Berkshire vice chairs Ajit Jain and Greg Abel will field questions alongside Buffett during Saturday’s morning question-and-answer session, and Abel and Buffett  will continue on the afternoon shift. In a statement, Buffett said that the three men “will not get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked.” “We know you... will pick some tough ones and that’s the way we like it,” he said. The multinational business conglomerate has been headed by Buffett since 1965, and owns a wide portfolio of businesses mainly in the insurance, rail transportation, energy, manufacturing, and retail sectors. It also has significant holdings in a number of major consumer brands, including Kraft Heinz, American Express, Bank of America, and Coca-Cola. Berkshire has posted year-to-date total returns of almost 12%, outperforming the S&P 500's total returns of almost 8%. Here are three things to watch at this year’s event. During past Berkshire conferences, Buffett has touched on some of the hottest topics of the year, from the regional banking crisis to U.S.-China economic tensions and Bitcoin. This year, Buffett has said that questions about what stocks Berkshire is buying and selling — despite that being public information — are off the table for discussion. So is politics. Nevertheless, investors will likely want a glimpse into the Oracle’s views on the wars in the Gaza Strip and Ukraine, interest rates, and other policy issues that are relevant to Berkshire’s business and the wider economy.  Read more: Warren Buffett doesn’t trust pundits and more takeaways from his annual note to shareholders While he likely won’t comment on something as concrete as who he’s voting for in the year’s presidential election, there’s a good chance some policy discussion will make it into the Q&A session. There may also be questions about artificial intelligence and tech stocks, given Berkshire’s outsize holdings in Apple, Amazon, and cloud data-warehousing firm Snowflake. Mainly, people just like to hear what Buffett thinks about whatever he’s thinking about. Whether that’s life lessons or investment insights, when Buffett talks, investors listen. Abel, who serves as chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and vice-chairman of non-insurance operations, is in line to succeed the 93-year-old Buffett as CEO.  The Canadian businessman was tapped  as heir apparent in 2021, when Buffett told CNBC that if something were to happen to him that night, the board of directors was in agreement that “it would be Greg who’d take over tomorrow morning.” Abel will have a starring role this year, appearing at both Q&A sessions. During last year’s conference, the late Charlie Munger heaped praise on Abel, calling him “sensational at being a business leader, both as a thinker and as a doer.” “There’s some things he’s better at than Warren is, and Warren knows that, and he just keeps dumping on Greg everything that Greg can do better, and that’s a lot,” Munger said. This is the first annual Berkshire shareholders meeting without Buffett’s right-hand business partner and friend, Charlie Munger. Munger served as vice chairman of Berkshire since 1978. He died in November, just weeks before his 100th birthday.  Guests would often look forward to the pair’s anecdotes and humor — both business-related and not — which tended to be a highlight of the annual conference. One long-time conference attendee told The Wall Street Journal that this year’s meeting will have “an empty-chair feeling” to it without Munger.

    "content": "The claims have been filed in a state court in Portland as part of a class action lawsuit by 1,000 victims of the fires. PacifiCorp, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, is facing $30bn in claims from victims of the 2020 Labor Day wildfires in Oregon, US. The demand is a significant increase in the legal challenges faced by the utility, which is one of the largest grid operators in the country. \n                        The gold standard of business intelligence.\n                     \n                            Find out more\n                            \n\n\n\n The claims have been filed in a state court in Portland as part of a class action lawsuit by 1,000 victims seeking compensation for the destruction of 2,500 properties in western Oregon. Each claimant is seeking up to $30m – $5m for tangible losses and up to $25m for intangible losses such as emotional distress. The amount sought in the amended complaint is roughly two and a half times the value of the utility itself, and significantly exceeds payouts from all claims resolved to date. In a previous legal decision, a jury ordered PacifiCorp to pay $90m to 17 claimants for gross negligence due to the utility’s failure to shut down power lines during a windstorm.

Despite being found liable for its role in the fires, PacifiCorp is appealing the verdict and has criticised the plaintiffs’ demands as excessive. The company stated: “The $30m demand for each plaintiff clearly demonstrates the need for some manner of reform in the legal process. “PacifiCorp’s ability to provide essential services is being threatened by excessive wildfire damages pursued by plaintiff’s attorneys who have a substantial financial stake in these outcomes.” The issue of wildfire liability is not unique to PacifiCorp; it has become a concern for utilities across the western US, with Berkshire chairman Warren Buffett highlighting the risk in his annual letter to investors. Berkshire Hathaway has acknowledged facing fire claims in Oregon and California amounting to $8bn, including more than $1bn from government agencies for firefighting and clean-up costs.  The utility’s failure to act on weather warnings and shut off electricity ahead of the windstorm was a focal point of the 2023 trial.

    "content": "      Berkshire Hathaway Inc will announce its first quarter earnings on Saturday, May 4, 2024. The billionaire Warren Buffett-led company will hold its 2024 Annual Shareholders Meeting on May 4.     Prior to the Annual Shareholders Meeting, Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Greg Abel, Vice Chairman Non-Insurance Operations and Ajit Jain, Vice Chairman Insurance Operations, will hold a question-and-answer session that will commence at approximately 9:15 a.m. Central time, the company said.     The Berkshire Hathaway AGM, which attracts thousands of people to Omaha to hear from legendary investor Warren Buffett, won’t be the same this year due to the absence of his friend and investing partner Charlie Munger.  Also Read: ‘Empty chair feeling’ to pervade Berkshire meeting without Munger    Munger, who was the former Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman, passed away last November at 99 years old.     It will be for the first time when the Berkshire Hathaway AGM will be held without Munger alongside Buffett.    Traditionally, the duo shared insights into their investment portfolios and strategies, offering invaluable financial and life advice to investors.    In February, Buffett paid tribute to Munger when he prefaced his annual letter to shareholders with a page titled “Charlie Munger — The Architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"    “Charlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me take the bows and receive the accolades,\" Buffett wrote.

Discovery. Since April's labor report was weaker than expected, he said investors can worry less about the Federal Reserve's next move. \"Now that it's clear the economy's having a meaningful slowdown, we no longer need to worry about the Fed becoming our enemy again,\" he said, adding, \"Which means we can go back to glorious stock picking mode, at least for like a couple of days, thanks to the benign employment number.\" On Saturday, Cramer said investors should follow Warren Buffett's annual meeting, which could be bullish for Berkshire Hathaway and stocks in its portfolio such as American Express, Apple, Coca-Cola and Occidental Petroleum. Monday brings earnings from Simon Property Group and Tyson Foods, the latter of which Cramer said he thinks could be a \"bounce-back play.\" Disney reports on Tuesday before the bell, and Cramer said he expects results to be positive after the cost cuts and initiatives management put in place to win its recent proxy battle. Wynn Resorts and Reddit also release earnings that day, and Cramer said he thinks both could put up solid numbers. Cramer will be paying attention to Uber's report on Wednesday, saying he wonders whether its earnings will be hurt by competition from Lyft. Toyota, Arm, Robinhood, Trade Desk, AMC Entertainment and Airbnb also report. He said he thinks Robinhood will do well because cryptocurrency remains popular. Roblox reports Thursday and Cramer said he expects it to be positive. Warner Bros. Discovery also reports, and Cramer said he wonders whether the company has lowered its debt and if it will keep its contract with the National Basketball Association. He said he is also interested to hear from Akamai Technologies and Tapestry. The latter's report could address the Federal Trade Commission's suit to stop its merger with Capri. On Friday, Cramer will be waiting for earnings from Enbridge. He said some investors are skeptical the company can pay its dividend. To Cramer, the dividend is safe, but he said he needs to see more aggressive growth to justify owning the stock.

With over 20,000 square feet of showroom space and more than 50,000 items of inventory, the exhibit hall at the CHI Health Center features goodies from various Berkshire's holding companies, from Brooks Running to See's Candies to Jazwares. Only shareholders can participate at the event and they can buy items at a special discount. The annual meeting will be exclusively broadcast on CNBC and livestreamed on CNBC.com. The special coverage will begin Saturday at 9:30 a.m. ET. Jazwares, the American toymaker best known for its Squishmallows plushie line, was a hit last year when it first displayed its wares at Berkshire Hathaway's conference, including the debut of a Warren Buffett plushie. This year, the company expanded its exhibit in the convention hall, making it three times larger. Some highlights include the latest Squishmallows toys in the images of Buffett and his longtime Berkshire partner, Charlie Munger, a splashy Squishmallows pit, as well as other displays. The Bookworm only had one book to sell this year: \"Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Essential Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger.\" That was at the request of Buffett in honor of his business partner of more than 60 years, who passed away in November at the age of 99. See's Candies was once again a crowd pleaser at this year's \"Woodstock for Capitalists.\" The special box of assorted chocolates for the 2024 annual meeting, sold for $16 each, featured a cartoon image of Buffett and the iconic Mary See. Shareholders could pick up the Oracle of Omaha's favorite — chocolate walnut fudge — as well as customizable boxes at the booth. Berkshire acquired pilot training company FlightSafety in 1996. At Friday's shopping event, the firm brought a taste of what its training program looks like for professional pilots. Shareholders lined up to put on virtual reality glasses and experience the flight simulation training. Truck-stop giant Pilot Travel Centers put up a big display with a real-sized red truck. The firm is largest operator of travel centers in North America, with more than 750 locations. Berkshire now fully owns Pilot Travel after buying the remaining 20% ownership interest from the Haslam family. The deal was not without drama as the Haslams last year sued Berkshire in a complaint that accused the conglomerate of using so-called pushdown accounting without authorization from the family. About 14 miles away from the main convention center, there's a separate shareholder-only shopping event at Berkshire-owned Jewelry store Borsheims. Shareholders browsed through one-of-a-kind jewelry, engagement rings and watches available for purchase at a discount. This 40-carat diamond bracelet from Ruchi New York was selling for $110,000 (picture above, on the left). In 2016, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought Duracell from Procter & Gamble, offering the consumer giant $4.7 billion of the shares it owned in P&G in exchange for the battery maker. Brooks Running attracted a long line of shareholders snapping up the 2024 special edition of its running shoes with \"brk\" on the side and a cartoon of a running Buffett on the insoles. Many shareholders are also set to participate in the Brooks \"Invest in Yourself\" 5K fun run and walk on Sunday, the morning following the annual meeting. Warren Buffett bought Dairy Queen in 1998 in a roughly $600 million transaction, and has made trips to the Omaha locations with his great-grandchildren. According to The Wall Street Journal, the billionaire investor has said in the past that his favorite DQ order is a vanilla soft serve topped with chocolate syrup and malted milk power.

You can opt out anytime.\t\t\t\t Tomorrow (May 4), Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) will kick off its annual shareholder meeting in the investing conglomerate’s home base in Omaha, Neb. This year, Buffett will host the meeting without his right-hand man, Charlie Munger, who passed away late last year at the age of 99. Thousands of Berkshire shareholders will look for updates on  Buffett’s succession plan as well as his next big bet, as the company is also set to report first-quarter earnings tomorrow morning. It will not be the first time Buffett leads the shareholder meeting by himself, though. He held Berkshire’s 2020 meeting—virtually due to Covid-19—without Munger and said, “It particularly doesn’t feel like an annual meeting because my partner of 60 years, Charlie Munger, is not sitting up here.” Munger’s passing in November put Berkshire’s energy business chief Greg Abel and insurance chief Ajit Jain in the spotlight. In 2021, Munger revealed at that year’s shareholder meeting that Abel would succeed Buffett as CEO if anything happened to the CEO. “The directors are in agreement that if something were to happen to me tonight, it would be Greg who’d take over tomorrow morning,” Buffett told CNBC subsequently. He added that, if for some reason Abel couldn’t do the job, Jain would step in as CEO. Abel, 59, and Jain, 70, were promoted to vice chairmen of Berkshire Hathaway’s board in 2018 and have taken on a larger role in recent years. “Ajit and Greg have rare talents, and Berkshire blood flows through their veins,” Buffett wrote in his 2018 letter to shareholders.  In April this year, Abel joined Buffett on his business trip to Japan, where he made large investments in the country’s top trading houses. Abel “does all the work, and I take the bows—it’s exactly what I wanted,” Buffett told CNBC at the time. Another item in focus at tomorrow’s meeting will be Buffett’s next big bet, especially given Berkshire’s giant cash pile. At the end of 2023, Berkshire had a record $168 billion in cash. Shareholders are eager to know how Buffett plans to invest that money. During the December quarter, Berkshire reduced its stake in Apple (its largest holding), Paramount Global and HP while increasing shares in Chevron, Occidental Petroleum and Sirius XM Holdings. Also late last year, Berkshire acquired a mystery stock that the company requested the SEC for permission to keep confidential. Shareholders may expect the company to share more details about that as well. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

He's emerged in recent years as one of Apple's top evangelists. At the end of 2023, Berkshire owned about 6% of Apple, a stake worth $174 billion at the time, or about 40% of the conglomerate's total value. That's about four times bigger than Berkshire's second-biggest public stock holding, Bank of America, and makes the company the No. 2 Apple shareholder, behind only Vanguard. As Berkshire investors and fanboys of the 93-year-old Buffett flood Omaha this weekend for the 2024 annual meeting, Apple is likely to be a hot topic of discussion. The tech giant on Thursday reported a 10% year-over-year decline in iPhone sales, leading to a 4% drop in total revenue. But the stock had its best day since late 2022 on Friday due largely to a $110 billion stock buyback plan and increased margins that result from a growing services business. The bet on Apple and CEO Tim Cook has paid off handsomely for Buffett, who said in 2022 that the cost of Berkshire's Apple stake was only $31 billion. His firm is up almost 620% on its investment since the start of 2016. Despite being a self-described Luddite, Buffett has long had a coherent non-techie thesis for loving Apple. He's seen how devoted Apple users are to their devices, and has viewed the iPhone as an extraordinary product that could keep its customers spending inside the Apple ecosystem. He calls it a moat, one of his favorite words for describing his preferred businesses. \"Apple has a position with consumers that they're paying $1,500 or whatever it may be for a phone, and these same people pay $35,000 for a second car,\" Buffett said at last year's meeting. \"And if they had to give up their second car or give up their iPhone, they'd give up their second car!\" Data is in his favor. According to a study from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, Apple benefits from 94% customer loyalty, meaning that nine out of 10 current U.S. iPhone owners choose another iPhone when buying a new device. Buffett also has hailed Apple's ability to return billions of dollars to shareholders annually through share buybacks and dividends, a capital allocation strategy for which the billionaire investor may have himself to thank. When the Apple CEO was asked in a 2016 interview with The Washington Post who he turns to for advice at pivotal moments, Cook offered up a story about his relationship with Buffett. \"When I was going through [the question of] what should we do on returning cash to shareholders, I thought who could really give us great advice here? Who wouldn't have a bias?\" Cook said. \"So I called up Warren Buffett. I thought he's the natural person.\" Apple has shown its appreciation for the Oracle of Omaha in other ways. In 2019, the company published an original iPhone game called \"Warren Buffett's Paper Wizard\" in which a paperboy bikes from Omaha to Apple's hometown of Cupertino, California. But with Apple's business having declined in size in five of the past six quarters and with the company expecting just low single-digit growth in the current quarter, Buffett may face questions this weekend at the shareholder meeting about whether he still sees the same power in the moat, particularly with regulatory pressures building around tech's mega-cap companies. Buffett trimmed his stake in Apple late last year, though only by about 1%. Even after Friday's rally, the stock is down 3.8% in 2024, while the S&P 500 is up 7.5%. Berkshire's initial foray into Apple in 2016 was not Buffett's idea. Rather, the investment was led by Ted Weschler, one of his top deputies, and was seen as a passing of the torch to the next generation of Berkshire investment managers. But the following year, Berkshire started purchasing even more Apple shares, and Buffett began talking it up. He said he liked the stock and the company's \"sticky\" product, although he didn't use it. In 2018, he said Apple users are \"very, very, very locked in, at least psychologically and mentally\" to the product and the ecosystem. \"Apple has an extraordinary consumer franchise,\" he said. At last year's annual meeting, when asked how Berkshire can defend having Apple make up so much of its public portfolio, Buffett said, \"It just happens to be a better business than any we own.\" He also hailed Cook, calling him one of the \"best managers in the world.\" A number Apple likes to use to tout the health of its business, despite the declining revenue, is \"2.2 billion.\" That's how many devices the company says are currently in use and points to the massive customer base available as Apple rolls out new subscription services. \"Once customers get into the ecosystem, they don't leave. So it's not a speculative tech play,\" said Dan Eye, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which owns Apple shares. \"It's kind of more like an annuity and I think that's what Warren Buffett really sees as well.\" In addition to the drop in revenue, Apple faces new challenges from regulations and weak overseas markets, as well as from Microsoft and Google's advancements in artificial intelligence. For regulators, the concern surrounds the very moat that Buffett finds so attractive, and whether it gives the company monopolistic control in the smartphone market. The U.S. government in March alleged that Apple designs its business to keep customers locked in. The Department of Justice's lawsuit claimed that products like Apple Card, the Apple Arcade game subscription, iMessage and Apple Watch work best or only with an iPhone, creating illegal barriers to competition and making it harder for consumers to switch when it's time for an upgrade. However, the litigation is expected to take years, pushing any potential penalties to Apple and its products well into the future. In the meantime, there's no sign that the iPhone is becoming less important as new devices like virtual reality goggles have found only niche audiences, while consumer AI products have failed to take off. Buffett hasn't voiced his view publicly on Apple's regulatory hurdles, and this will be the first opportunity for investors to ask him about the issue since the DOJ's lawsuit. But Buffett knows a little something about regulation — two markets where he's most active are railroads and insurance. In a note to clients earlier this month, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi didn't go deep on regulatory concerns, but mentioned that he doesn't believe the DOJ suit will \"seriously threaten\" the strength of Apple's ecosystem. He also said that following Buffett's lead on getting in and out of Apple is a solid strategy for making money. \"Despite his reputation as a long term buy and hold investor, Warren Buffett has been remarkably disciplined at adding to his Apple position when it is relatively cheap and trimming when it is relatively expensive,\" Sacconaghi wrote. He encouraged investors to \"be like Buffett.\" Odds are that Buffett was thrilled with Apple's announcement this week regarding its expanded repurchase program. It's a practice he's long adored. \"When I buy Apple, I know that Apple is going to repurchase a lot of shares,\" he said in 2018.  And he likes to note how buybacks result in getting a bigger stake in the company without buying more shares. \"The math of repurchases grinds away slowly, but can be powerful over time,\" Buffett said in 2021. Apple also increased its dividend by 4%, and signaled that it would continue to lift it annually. Buffett was effusive about the tech giant's capital-return strategy at the conglomerate's annual meeting last year, pointing out that it helped Berkshire own a bigger piece of the pie. Unlike insurance company Geico and homebuilder Clayton Homes, which his firm owns in their entirety, Berkshire can continue to increase its stake in Apple, a fact he reminded investors of at the meeting. \"The good thing about Apple is that we can go up,\" Buffett said.

    "content": "3D Rendering Of Magnet with Group of People. Shareholder clienteles perhaps matter less if your stock is on a tear. Absent that, publicly listed companies would do well to court an anchor long term owner to partner with to stick to a strategy of patient investment.  The marketing folks spent an enormous amount of time crafting products for the right customer clientele. A lot of thought usually goes into thinking about the demographics of the customer (age, gender, marital status, occupation), their geographical location (US and Canada, EMEA or Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia, or micro markets in the US) and other characteristics such as culture and language, their interests, behavior, and perceived status. One can segment customers along literally infinite dimensions. This discussion had me thinking about whether CEOs and CFOs put in this much thought into cultivating shareholder clienteles. As an illustration, I thought I should go pull up some data on changes in shareholder segments over the last 10 years for one company as a case study: IBM. I picked IBM because it is often accused of missing at least three technology waves: mobile computing, cloud computing and AI. I wanted to check whether value or dividend yield focused investors pressured management to pay out dividends at the cost of long-term investments. IBM’s competitors such as Amazon and Microsoft have somehow avoided these arguably myopic pressures. Perhaps as a consequence, IBM’s stock returns have underperformed the S&P 500 and even a US treasury ETF over the last 10 years. Let’s get to the data. As per S&P’s CAP IQ database, roughly 60% of IBM is owned by institutions with the remaining 40% held by the public, presumably individuals and unidentified others. Of the portion owned by institutions, CAP IQ states that 84% is held by what the database calls “traditional investment managers,” 8% is owned by banks/investment banks, 3% by government pension sponsors and 2% by hedge fund managers. I pulled out data for the top owners of IBM over the last 10 years (March 2014 compared with December 2023) to check whether there is a steady clientele of shareholders interested in owning the stock. I picked 10 years to represent a potential cycle where investments begin to fetch returns. Perhaps that is too long but it’s a reasonable starting point. Here is what I found: IBM shareholders from 2013-2024 In the table above, ownership refers to the latest available data on how much of IBM is currently owned by these investors. The column 2023 over 2014 simply divides the proportion of stock owned by the investor in December 2023 by that owned in March 2014. This column suggests that Vanguard and BlackRock have increased their ownership over the last decade by 46-50% even as IBM’s stock has tanked. If I were the CFO of IBM, who can I chat with to discuss long term strategy assuming that they will stay with me as a shareholder for a long horizon? And I was left scratching my head for good answers. The three biggest owners are BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, collectively accounting for 23.2% of the company. Why? Because IBM is a part of several indexes and the Big Three, by and large, hold indexed investments. Does the Big Three have the time, bandwidth, interest, and the legal clearance to engage in deep discussions with IBM over long term strategy? Most probably not, as alluded to by my joint work on the Big Three’s engagement record. What should one make of the remaining investors? Perhaps the state pension funds, Calpers and Norges, can be useful long-term partners? What should one make of the several banks that own stock in IBM? Are they being held in the “street name” for someone else? Do these banks have any interest in engaging with IBM over strategy? What about the asset managers in the list? Many, if not most, sell mutual funds of every conceivable, often contradictory, style such as value, growth, quality, and the like. They are, in effect, a supermarket of several investing styles and arguably do not have a particular view over how IBM should be run. Where does this leave the CFO and the Investor Relations arm of IBM? · For sure, there is a lot of churn among positions and owners over the last 10 years. The pressure to cater to these transient investors to get through a quarter or two must surely be intense. · Why do CFOs worry so much about doing well in quarterly earnings conference calls, apart from of course their inherent competitive instinct to do well at whatever they do and the short term nature of most executive compensation? Surely analysts are not investors! · The other day, a senior CFO shared the following amusing but disturbing anecdote: “XX firm, a very prominent mutual fund shop, without blinking an eyelid tells us, “We are long term investors. Our holding period is 18 months!” Meetings with this mutual fund shop in New York represents a peanut gallery of 18 odd fund managers of individual funds, probing the CFO for cues on whether they should actually hold the stock for 18 months.” How is this interaction useful to the company for generating long term value? · Analysts tend to ask for quarterly earnings guidance. Could companies with stable long-term owners arguably pay less attention to guidance and more to their long-term investment plans? Berkshire Hathaway does not give earnings guidance, for example. · What pressure does the retail investor exert on IBM? Not a lot except perhaps a desire for good dividend yields? How has that changed with rising interest rates? · What, if anything, can IBM do to seek out a different investor clientele? Would an anchor owner who can partner with IBM with patient capital lay the foundation for rapid growth? I have often said in my classes that we almost need a new investor class: public private equity. By that I mean, someone who is willing to hold under-performing public companies for a long time (7-10 years) and is willing to work with management to release hidden value in the under-performer. When I put this to a few CFOs and board members, they generally said that finding the right clientele is just very hard. The recommendation is that a firm like IBM needs to articulate a clear strategy, preferably one that targets growth. And then the firm needs to provide proof points of success, repeatedly. Eventually, over time, which may mean five years, the “right” clientele, will come along. Success brings in momentum investors or even growth investors who may stay with you till you keep growing. Once growth stalls or if the prospects of growth stalls, momentum and growth investors leave. Even a self-professed value investor such as Warren Buffett, famously held IBM for seven years, and gave up in 2018-19 to pick up Apple. Buffett arguably got fed up with the lack of a coherent strategy to turn IBM around. Some of this sounds circular. Value investors in my stock will not let me set aside significant capital for risky investments to eventually grow as they want to be paid dividends and share buybacks. Perhaps the trick is to somehow shed the value guys by grabbing the initiative and moving ahead with a growth plan. The value folks may sell in the short run leading to a short term fall in the stock price. But, a short term hit may be better than long term stasis. Assuming a firm has a reasonable strategy, perhaps another tactic may be to seek out an anchor owner who will serve the role of the public private equity firm. As an example, Bill Gates’ fund, Cascade Investment LLC, is the largest non-index owner of John Deere (7% owner). Cascade has held concentrated stakes in Republic Services, Ecolab, and Auto Nation for years. Indeed, research by my colleague, Kalash Jain at Columbia, suggests that stocks held by the same non-index investor for a long duration outperform the market. Is it time for the CFO and the IR folks to think harder about finding the right shareholder clientele and hopefully escape the grind of transient investors and performative quarterly conference calls? Of course, the best place to start is to come up with a credible growth strategy and deliver results.  One Community.

O encontro anual de acionistas da Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), empresa do megainvestidor Warren Buffett, será no sábado (4) – e quem se deslocou até o interior dos Estados Unidos para participar está cheio de expectativa. “Estar entre tantos investidores de ponta é um aprendizado por si só, e ver Buffett falando sobre a Berkshire e o mercado é uma oportunidade”, diz o analista brasileiro Rodrigo Medeiros, que está pela primeira vez no evento. “Ver presencialmente é diferente de ver pela internet”. Leia também: InfoMoney vai a Omaha para conferência anual da Berkshire Hathaway, de Warren Buffett Continua depois da publicidade A reunião da Berkshire é diferente da maioria dos encontros com acionistas promovidos por outras empresas. De um lado, o dia é uma vitrine para as muitas companhias nas quais Buffett tem participação – elas montam estandes na CHI Health Center Arena, em Omaha, no estado de Nebraska, onde ocorre o evento. De outro, os participantes têm a chance real de fazer perguntas diretamente a Buffett – que será acompanhado no palco por Greg Abel, responsável pelas operações não relacionadas a seguros da Berkshire, e por Ajit Jain, que supervisiona especificamente os negócios de seguros. Os três podem responder até 60 perguntas durante a reunião. Baixe um ebook gratuito que revela o método Warren Buffett de investir em ações Continua depois da publicidade Eliseu Manica Júnior gostaria que uma das perguntas respondidas fosse a sua. Ele é o fundador da Experato, assessoria de investimentos de Santo Ângelo, no Rio Grande do Sul, e está entre as dezenas de brasileiros participantes da conferência deste ano. É sua quinta vez no evento – e nessa, perguntaria a Buffett: “Com a ascensão de novas tecnologias, como inteligência artificial e blockchain, como o senhor adapta sua estratégia de investimento para identificar e avaliar as vantagens competitivas duráveis em empresas, especialmente aquelas que operam em setores tradicionais?” Da comunidade brasileira ouvida pelo InfoMoney em Omaha, Manica Júnior está entre os investidores “veteranos” na Berkshire – ele tem os papéis desde 2019, período em que calcula ter ganhado cerca de 100% com eles. Já Lucas Biolchini, analista da XP Asset, é mais recente na base acionária da empresa. Investe há cerca de um ano e meio, com ganhos de 30%. Ir à conferência era um desejo antigo, diz Biolchini, acelerado pelo falecimento de Charlie Munger – o sócio de longa data de Buffett morreu em novembro de 2023, aos 99 anos. “A chance de ‘respirar o ar de Omaha’ e de conhecer pessoas do mundo todo que também têm Buffett, Munger e a Berkshire como inspirações me animou”. Sua pergunta ao megainvestidor? Continua depois da publicidade “Perguntaria sobre os recentes investimentos em empresas japonesas, para entender melhor sua visão sobre o perfil de crescimento delas e a alocação de capital” A edição de 2024 também é a estreia de Renato Breia, sócio-fundador da Nord Investimentos, nas conferências da Berkshire. Só a “caravana” da Nord seguiu para Omaha com 12 pessoas. “Faria a ele uma pergunta sobre investimento de longo prazo”, diz. “ Com o mundo mudando tão rapidamente rápido , o ‘long term investment’ ficou mais ‘short’? As mudanças no portfólio dele também aceleraram” Entre outras perguntas que podem ser endereçadas a Buffett há temas mais espinhosos – riscos climáticos, por exemplo. A empresa de energia PacifiCorp – que está no portfólio da Berkshire – é alvo de reclamações de responsabilidade por incêndios no Oregon em 2020. Outras investidas também enfrentaram litígios que podem despertar a curiosidade dos investidores. A imobiliária HomeServices of America assinou recentemente um acordo de US$ 250 milhões (R$ 1,3 bilhão) para liquidar uma ação judicial envolvendo comissões pagas aos corretores. Ainda nesta semana, foi alvo de uma nova reclamação de um grupo de compradores de casas, acusando a corretora de inflacionar as comissões. Continua depois da publicidade Buffett costuma ver seu vasto império empresarial como um barômetro da saúde econômica dos EUA – e muitos investidores devem buscar indicações quanto a isso na sessão de perguntas e respostas. A inflação e os juros mais altos podem pesar sobre os negócios industriais, de serviços e de varejo da Berkshire, embora essas operações tenham se mostrado resilientes. No ano passado, ele previu que a maioria das empresas da Berkshire reportaria ganhos mais baixos – o que não aconteceu. A empresa teve lucros operacionais de US$ 8,48 bilhões no quarto trimestre, acima dos US$ 6,63 bilhões do ano anterior. Também haverá quem queira saber sobre um problema, digamos, sui generis que a Berkshire enfrenta nos últimos tempos: excesso de dinheiro sem ter em que gastar, uma vez que os valuations elevados nas bolsas reduziram o rol de empresas candidatas. Continua depois da publicidade O caixa da empresa saltou para um recorde de US$ 167,6 bilhões no final de 2023 – e os analistas preveem que o volume poderá ter crescido nos resultados que a Berkshire vai anunciar no sábado. “Buffett vai manter essa posição de caixa até que as pessoas fiquem mais negativas em relação às ações”, diz Bill Smead, diretor de investimentos da Smead Capital Management.

Greg Abel e Ajit Jain, vice-presidentes da Berkshire, estarão presentes durante grande parte do dia. Os acionistas provavelmente estarão focados no que Abel, o sucessor nomeado por Buffett para assumir o cargo de CEO e responsável pelas operações não relacionadas a seguros do conglomerado, terá a dizer. Na carta anual de Buffett aos investidores, ele fez referência aos desafios enfrentados pelas maiores empresas da Berkshire, dentre as quais a ferrovia BNSF (queda nos volumes de embarques) e seu negócio de utilities (incêndios florestais). No mês passado, a enorme corretora imobiliária da empresa, a HomeServices of America, também concordou em desembolsar US$ 250 milhões para fechar acordos em processos judiciais relativos a comissões inflacionadas por vendas de imóveis.

Certamente haverá muitas perguntas sobre os investimentos exclusivos da Berkshire. O desempenho das ações da empresa este ano ultrapassou o da Apple (um dos maiores investimentos de Buffett; leia mais sobre isso abaixo), da Microsoft e da Tesla, bem como o do S&P 500. Continua depois da publicidade Com as taxas de juros permanecendo mais elevadas por mais tempo e as ações de muitos gigantes da tecnologia perdendo força, os acionistas estarão interessados em saber onde Buffett enxerga oportunidades futuras. Elas podem incluir investimentos da empresa na petroleira Occidental Petroleum e em cinco tradings japoneses, cujas ações dispararam. Os participantes também podem desejar ouvir Buffett explicar qual teria sido sua admissão mais significativa nos últimos anos: hoje, a Berkshire é tão grande que é pouco provável que ela encontre quaisquer aquisições importantes – a fonte histórica dos descomunais retornos sobre os investimentos de Buffett – na qual gastar sua fabulosa fortuna estimada em US$ 163 bilhões. “Em suma, não haverá um desempenho de encher os olhos”, escreveu Buffet na carta anual deste ano. E pode haver incertezas sobre quem será responsável por selecionar as ações para Buffett. Todd Combs e Ted Weschler gerenciam partes do portfólio de investimentos da Berkshire há anos. No entanto, o desempenho deles tem ficado muito aquém do alcançado pelo próprio Buffett e do S&P 500, o que levanta dúvidas sobre a futura proposta de valor da Berkshire.

    "title": "I Protested for Divestment From Sudan. What Today’s Protestors Should Know",
    "description": "For divestment from Israel to actually work, students and administrators must change their tactics, writes Scott Warren.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-03T17:11:13Z",
    "content": "As a former student activist, it’s been a surreal experience following the pro-Palestinian protests occurring at universities across the country. Almost 20 years ago, I helped lead national efforts across the country to divest universities, cities, and states from foreign companies aiding and abetting the genocide in Darfur, Sudan—the last effort that inspired massive divestiture action from institutions of higher education across the country. Despite our successful divestment efforts, the situation in Darfur is once again at a dire point, with a humanitarian disaster looming. This time, very few are sounding the alarm. Looking back on our efforts to divest American entities from companies in Sudan, two critical lessons emerge: First, a targeted approach to divestment is crucial to any potential campaign victory. Secondly, divestment on its own, while potentially important, is ultimately an insufficient tool in materially changing the situation on the ground, especially without long-term, sustained activism and engagement. In 2005, the genocide in Darfur captured the attention of thousands of college students across the country. Protesting a regime that massacred up to 400,000 of its own people through use of militia groups in the western region of Sudan, students organized massive protests in Washington, DC and their own campuses, pushed for congressional action, and engaged in acts of civil disobedience. Students also helped to lead a nationwide divestment movement, lobbying universities and states to pull their investments out of companies directly or indirectly aiding the government to carry out the atrocities. Ultimately,  35 states, including California and Texas, divested from Sudan, and over 50 universities participated in the effort. I helped to lead national efforts as the Student Director for STAND: A Student Anti-Genocide Coalition, and worked on successful campaigns to convince my alma-mater Brown University, the City of Providence, and the State of Rhode Island to divest their assets from Sudan. We engaged in a purposefully targeted approach, using research to determine lists of specific companies that were engaged in business activities that could be demonstrated to support and facilitate the Sudanese government’s internationally recognized genocidal actions and human rights violations. This list included Chinese and Russian oil and gas companies, as it could be proven that oil revenues helped pad the coffers of the murderous regime. The divestiture efforts were also explicitly targeted at universities’ direct investments, which comprise only about 5% of most endowments. Indeed, in a case like Brown, the university was not directly invested in any of the companies targeted, but rather, put them on a do-not-invest list as a result of our efforts. The rest of the university endowment is invested in commingled or mutual funds (this reality did lead to students pushing fund managers like Fidelity Investments and Berkshire Hathaway to divest from Sudan). Recognizing that the primary responsibility of the investment office is to secure a high rate of return for fiduciaries, and not to make political statements, this targeted approach also enables investment managers to easily replace any divested assets with similar companies. It’s difficult to speak to every university’s current demands for divestment concerning Israel, but focusing on Brown University’s campaign may be instructive. First, Brown’s response has stood out because the University Administration agreed to present divestment from Israel as an option to Brown’s Corporation, which is the equivalent of the Board of Directors. Given the vast number of universities that divested from Sudan, and in the 1990’s from South Africa, most institutions have a process in place to explore the financial action. Irrespective of their opinions on the merits of divestment in this case, it’s disappointing that, at a base level, most administrators are refusing to even explore these processes. Read More: What to Know About the Global Boycott Movement Against Israel Secondly, Brown’s campaign has been specific about its demands for divestiture. The students are not asking for divestment from every company linked to Israel (which is the unrealistic ask of Columbia University students) or even Israeli companies (which University of Michigan students want).  Brown Divest has stated its goal is “divestment from companies which profit from human rights abuses in Palestine.” In that vein, the group has outlined criteria to identify such companies, including those that provide products or services that contribute to the maintenance of the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, and those that provide products or services that contribute to violent acts. From this criteria, the students identified 10 specific companies that would be targeted for divestment. This is not to argue that Brown should, or will, divest from these companies.  But the process of identifying criteria, focusing on a university's direct investments, and presenting recommendations to the Corporation for a vote are all responsible actions by the students and administrators alike. This targeted campaign is the only approach towards divestment that has any potential for success. Even if targeted divestment efforts are successful, the most important question, which remains currently unanswerable, is whether these campaigns would actually make a difference on the ground. Despite our successful divestment campaigns 20 years ago, Darfur is collapsing yet again. Sudan’s military is engaged in a fight for power with the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group, causing the biggest humanitarian crisis in decades. There are concrete actions that the United States can take, including pushing for negotiations, engaging in targeted sanctions, and leading anti-money laundering measures. This time around, however, there is essentially no domestic political will for taking action. Student activism has died out for the cause. It’s counterproductive to engage in conflict comparisons between Gaza and Sudan. Student activists today would argue that U.S. taxpayers are subsidizing the Israeli government’s actions, whereas the situation in Sudan is less directly tied to our actions. Both situations, however, are tragic, and tens of thousands innocent human lives are being lost. If student activists today want to make a difference in the situation in Gaza, there are lessons to be learned from our work in Sudan. First, if they want to be successful in divestiture efforts, the work needs to be targeted. And secondly, students must recognize that the work to push for a peaceful Middle East will take a generation. I look at the protests today with a deep belief in the power of collective action and recognizing students’ rights to organize in the face of injustice. I also note that this issue is much more contentious than the genocide in Darfur, which was universally condemned by Americans. What is clear, though, is that both the protestors and university administrators need to change their tactics. It’s imperative that today’s student activists do not look back in 15 years with a situation in Gaza that mirrors, or is worse, than today’s morass. Contact us at letters@time.com"

The identity of the stock — or stocks — that Berkshire has been snapping up could be revealed Saturday at the company's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. That's because unless Berkshire has been granted confidential treatment on the investment for a third quarter in a row, the stake will be disclosed in filings later this month. So the 93-year-old Berkshire CEO may decide to explain his rationale to the thousands of investors flocking to the gathering. The bet, shrouded in mystery, has captivated Berkshire investors since it first appeared in disclosures late last year. At a time when Buffett has been a net seller of stocks and lamented a dearth of opportunities capable of \"truly moving the needle at Berkshire,\" he has apparently found something he likes — and in the financial realm no less. That's an area he has dialed back on in recent years over concerns about rising loan defaults. High interest rates have taken a toll on some financial players like regional U.S. banks, while making the yield on Berkshire's cash pile in instruments like T-bills suddenly attractive. \"When you are the GOAT of investing, people are interested in what you think is good,\" said Glenview Trust Co. Chief Investment Officer Bill Stone, using an acronym for greatest of all time. \"What makes it even more exciting is that banks are in his circle of competence.\" Under Buffett, Berkshire has trounced the S&P 500 over nearly six decades with a 19.8% compounded annual gain, compared with the 10.2% yearly rise of the index. Coverage note: The annual meeting will be exclusively broadcast on CNBC and livestreamed on CNBC.com. Our special coverage will begin Saturday at 9:30 a.m. ET. Berkshire requested anonymity for the trades because if the stock was known before the conglomerate finished building its position, others would plow into the stock as well, driving up the price, according to David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland. Buffett is said to control roughly 90% of Berkshire's massive stock portfolio, leaving his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler the rest, Kass said. While investment disclosures give no clue as to what the stock could be, Stone, Kass and other Buffett watchers believe it is a multibillion-dollar wager on a financial name. That's because the cost basis of banks, insurers and finance stocks owned by the company jumped by $3.59 billion in the second half of last year, the only category to increase, according to separate Berkshire filings. At the same time, Berkshire exited financial names by dumping insurers Markel and Globe Life, leading investors to estimate that the wager could be as large as $4 billion or $5 billion through the end of 2023. It's unknown whether that bet was on one company or spread over multiple firms in an industry. If it were a classic Buffett bet — a big stake in a single company —  that stock would have to be a large one, with perhaps a $100 billion market capitalization. Holdings of at least 5% in publicly traded American companies trigger disclosure requirements. Investors have been speculating for months about what the stock could be. Finance covers all manner of companies, from retail lenders to Wall Street brokers, payments companies and various sectors of insurance. Charles Schwab or Morgan Stanley could fit the bill, according to James Shanahan, an Edward Jones analyst who covers banks and Berkshire Hathaway. \"Schwab was beaten down during the regional banking crisis last year, they had an issue where retail investors were trading out of cash into higher-yielding investments,\" Shanahan said. \"Nobody wanted to own that name last year, so Buffett could've bought as much as he wanted.\" Other names that have been circulated — JPMorgan Chase or BlackRock, for example, are possible, but may make less sense given valuations or business mix. Truist and other higher-quality regional banks might also fit Buffett's parameters, as well as insurer AIG, Shanahan said, though their market capitalizations are smaller. Berkshire has owned financial names for decades, and Buffett has stepped in to inject capital — and confidence — into the industry on multiple occasions. Buffett served as CEO of a scandal-stricken Salomon Brothers in the early 1990s to help turn the company around. He pumped $5 billion into Goldman Sachs in 2008 and another $5 billion into Bank of America in 2011, ultimately becoming the latter's largest shareholder. But after loading up on lenders in 2018, from universal banks like JPMorgan to regional lenders like PNC Financial and U.S. Bank, he deeply pared his exposure to the sector in 2020 on concerns that the coronavirus pandemic would punish the industry. Since then, he and his deputies have mostly avoided adding to his finance stakes, besides modest positions in Citigroup and Capital One. Last May, Buffett told shareholders to expect more turbulence in banking. He said Berkshire could deploy more capital in the industry, if needed. \"The situation in banking is very similar to what it's always been in banking, which is that fear is contagious,\" Buffett said. \"Historically, sometimes the fear was justified, sometimes it wasn't.\" Wherever he placed his bet, the move will be seen as a boost to the company, perhaps even the sector, given Buffett's track record of identifying value. It's unclear how long regulators will allow Berkshire to shield its moves. \"I'm hopeful he'll reveal the name and talk about the strategy behind it,\" Shanahan said. \"The SEC's patience can wear out, at some point it'll look like Berkshire's getting favorable treatment.\" — CNBC's Yun Li contributed to this report.

Some 30,000 rapt shareholders are descending on Omaha for what's been called \"Woodstock for Capitalists.\" Pandemic lockdown apart, it will be the first without Munger, Buffett's longtime partner who passed away in November about a month shy of his 100th birthday. \"The meeting will only have one comedian up there\" this year, said David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland and a Berkshire shareholder, who has attended more than 20 annual meetings. \"There'll be, let's say, a more serious, less humorous background.\" The annual meeting will be exclusively broadcast on CNBC and livestreamed on CNBC.com. Our special coverage will begin Saturday at 9:30 a.m. ET. For the first time, Berkshire will broadcast its annual meeting movie that had previously always been reserved only for those in attendance in Omaha. Many speculate this year's will be a tear-jerker tribute to Munger. Vice Chairman of Non-Insurance Operations Greg Abel, Buffett's designated successor, will fill Munger's seat in the afternoon session, helping answer shareholder questions. Vice Chairman of Insurance Operations Ajit Jain will join Buffett, the CEO, and Abel in the morning session. Buffett has said they expect to field about 40 to 60 questions Saturday. \"The tone of the meeting is certainly going to be a lot different without Charlie,\" said Steve Check, CEO of Check Capital Management and a longtime Berkshire shareholder. \"He was the one that really made it funny. It's getting closer and closer to the transition, so it's good to see Ajit and Greg on the stage.\" Munger's investment philosophy rubbed off on Buffett early on, giving rise to the sprawling conglomerate worth $860 billion that Berkshire is today. Generations of investors also appreciated Munger's trademark bluntness and humor, rare to come by on Wall Street. If anything, the sea of Buffett admirers will cherish his folksy wisdom even more as the \"Oracle of Omaha\" turns 94 in less than four months. Here are some of the big topics shareholders want Buffett to discuss: The annual meeting comes at a tricky time for markets as a pickup in inflation puts the brakes on the Federal Reserve's plan to cut interest rates this year. While the Berkshire CEO doesn't make investment decisions based on daily headlines, investors still are eager to hear any market commentary and guidance from the protege of the father of value investing, Ben Graham. \"They don't time their investments,\" Kass said of Berkshire. \"The economy goes through cycles. They totally ignore cycles. They invest for a long run, and they really ignore what pretty much what the Federal Reserve is doing. I believe that will be his answer.\" Shareholders may seek an explanation as to why Berkshire sold about 10 million Apple shares (1% of its massive stake) in the fourth quarter. At the end of 2023, Berkshire owned 905,560,000 shares of the iPhone maker, worth more than $174 billion and taking up more than 40% of the portfolio. The move came as a surprise to many because Apple has been Buffett's favorite stock for years, and he even called the tech giant his second-most important business after Berkshire's cluster of insurers. What's more, the last time Buffett trimmed this bet, he admitted it was \"probably a mistake.' Shares of the iPhone maker got a big boost Friday after the firm announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in company history. However, Apple posted a decline in overall sales and in iPhone sales. There's a small chance that Buffett will reveal the identity of the mystery bank stock that Berkshire has been buying for two quarters straight. In the third and fourth quarters of 2023, Berkshire requested that the Securities and Exchange Commission keep the details of one or more of its stock holdings confidential. Many speculated that the secret purchase could be a bank stock as the conglomerate's cost basis for \"banks, insurance, and finance\" equity holdings jumped by around $2.37 billion. \"He will comment as late as possible.... Charlie would be the only one that would let it slip once in a while. It's not going to happen with Warren,\" Check said. Berkshire's succession could be front and center at this meeting after Munger's passing. Abel, became known as Buffett's heir apparent in 2021 after Munger inadvertently made the revelation. Abel has been overseeing a major portion of Berkshire's sprawling empire, including energy, railroad and retail. Buffett revealed previously that Abel's taken on most of the responsibilities at Berkshire. Still, some questions remain as to who will be helping allocate capital at Berkshire, and the roles of Buffett's investing managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, who is also the CEO of Geico.

But one of the biggest factors to his success has nothing to do with picking the right companies. \"His skill is investing, but his secret is time,\" Morgan Housel wrote in the bestselling business book, \"The Psychology of Money.\" \"That's how compounding works,\" Housel wrote. To that point, 99% of Buffett's net worth was accumulated after he was 65 years old, Housel said during a 2022 interview with CNBC. \"If Buffett retired at age 65, you would have never heard of him,\" Housel said. Today, Buffett's total net worth is estimated at $132 billion. That's up substantially from the $84.5 billion net worth Buffett had at the time Housel's book was published in 2020. Most of that wealth came in Buffett's later years, Housel wrote, with $84.2 billion after he turned 50 and $81.5 billion after he turned 65. Compound interest accumulates not only on the initial amount invested, but also to the interest in previous periods. Buffett has compared it to a snowball rolling down a hill. By the time it gets to the bottom, it is much larger. \"The trick is to have a very long hill, which means starting very young or living … to be very old,\" Buffett said. Everyday investors can easily put the power of compound interest to work. \"Start early — as young as you can — and even if it's just small amounts, just keep doing it,\" said David Rea, president of Salem Investment Counselors in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Buffett himself got an early start, making his first stock purchase at age 11. But after selling the three shares of Cities Service, he saw the stock surge, which served as an early lesson that it's hard to predict when to buy a stock and when to sell it. More from Personal Finance:Advice about 401(k) rollovers is poised for a big change. Here's whyIRS free filing pilot processed more than 140,000 returns, commissioner saysHere's why new home sales inch higher despite 7% mortgage rates People tend to get excited when the market is going up, which prompts them to buy, noted Bradley Klontz, a certified financial planner and behavioral finance expert with Your Mental Wealth Advisors. Then when markets drop, they tend to get scared and sell, which is the opposite of what they should be doing, said Klontz, who is also a member of the CNBC FA Council. The S&P 500 has returned more than 10% per year on average over the past 100 years, Klontz noted. Yet investors who try to time the market won't reap the full benefit of those gains if they're moving in and out of their investments. Individuals are not necessarily to blame; survival instincts will prompt you to follow the crowd. \"We're wired to do it,\" Klontz said. We're also wired to consume today rather than prioritize future gratification. To combat that, it helps to have a specific vision for why you're investing — the freedom you hope to achieve, the car you want to drive and the emotional satisfaction that life will bring you, Klontz said. When you clearly have that goal in mind, take action and set up automated movements of your money, say from your paycheck to your 401(k) plan, he recommended. Like Buffett, individuals will also reap the most rewards if they start young. \"It's actually pretty easy to become a millionaire if you're starting early,\" Klontz said. But the longer you wait, the harder it is to catch up. For example, the $5 a day you would need to accumulate $1 million when you're just starting out may turn into $500 a month at age 30, he said. The good news is that an investment strategy does not need to be complicated. Buffett himself has recommended individuals keep it simple with a low-cost S&P 500 index fund. \"If you buy an S&P 500, index fund, week in and week out, you will compound to a large amount of money,\" Rea said. Investors can also take other cues from Buffett — don't panic; buy American; and keep investing through good and bad, Rea said. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

    "published_at": "2024-05-03T11:32:19Z",
    "content": "According to an article by Gregory Zuckerman for The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Warren Buffett, known for his cautious investment style, made a surprising pivot in 2016 when Berkshire Hathaway began accumulating shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). Historically, Buffett and his partner Charlie Munger had steered clear of tech stocks, with Munger even describing Apple as “un-Berkshirelike” in a 2013 Reuters interview. This deviation from their typical investment philosophy marked a significant turn, especially given Buffett’s earlier skepticism about the tech giant’s stock potential. Per the WSJ report, Buffett’s initial reluctance was transformed as he began to view Apple more as a consumer goods company with considerable pricing power due to strong brand loyalty. This shift in perception, catalyzed by high customer retention rates and the addictive quality of Apple products, prompted a large-scale investment in the company. Starting with an initial purchase of nearly 10 million shares in 2016, Berkshire Hathaway substantially increased its Apple stake over the next two years, investing approximately $36 billion. By the end of 2018, Apple constituted about a quarter of Berkshire’s investment portfolio, making it one of Buffett’s most significant single investments. The Wall Street Journal reports that this investment has been immensely profitable for Berkshire, with its Apple stake now valued at about $157 billion, despite recent declines in Apple’s stock price.  Berkshire Hathaway has realized approximately $120 billion in gains, a testament to the extraordinary success of this investment, which outperformed the S&P 500 by a significant margin during the same period. However, current circumstances have introduced new challenges for Apple, as highlighted by the WSJ. The tech giant faces regulatory scrutiny, slowing growth in China, and increasing competition in the tech industry, particularly in artificial intelligence. These factors contribute to the heightened risk profile of Apple’s stock, which has already seen a 6.79% drop this year. As Warren Buffett contemplates the future leadership of Berkshire Hathaway, the management of this enormous stake in Apple remains a critical issue. Despite some reduction in their holdings, Berkshire still holds a substantial portion of Apple shares. The decision to maintain such a large investment in Apple reflects Buffett’s confidence in the long-term value of the company, despite its current challenges and the broader tech industry’s dynamic nature. Yesterday, Apple announced financial results for its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended March 30, 2024). Apple announced an all-time high revenue of $90.8 billion. According to Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, this outcome includes a revenue record in the company’s Services segment. The quarter was notably marked by the launch of the Apple Vision Pro, showcasing the extensive possibilities of spatial computing. Looking ahead, Apple anticipates unveiling another major product next week (rumored to be a new iPad Pro), with further excitement building towards the Worldwide Developers Conference scheduled for the following month. Cook emphasized the company’s commitment to excellence in product and service offerings, aligning with Apple’s foundational values. Apple said its sustained success is reflected in unprecedented levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, contributing to a record-high active installed base across all product categories and geographic areas. This performance has led to a new earnings per share (EPS) record for the March quarter, as stated by Apple’s CFO, Luca Maestri.  The board has approved an increase in the quarterly dividend for the twelfth consecutive year, now at $0.25 per share, marking a 4 percent increase. This dividend is set to be distributed on May 16, 2024, to shareholders recorded by the close of business on May 13, 2024. Additionally, the board has authorized a substantial new share repurchase program, committing an additional $110 billion to buy back Apple’s common stock. Apple says these decisions underscore the board’s confidence in the continued value and future growth potential of Apple, aiming to further reward its shareholders amidst ongoing financial success. In pre-market trading, AAPL is currently (as of 11:25 a.m. UTC on May 3) at $183.79, up $10.76 (6.22%). Since hardware sales were disappointing, the only explanation for the pop in the share price is the $110 billion share buyback program. According to a report by CNBC, “overall sales fell 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% year over year during the quarter, which Apple attributed to a tough comparison versus last year.”   If Apple does not do anything impressive with AI or find a way to increase its sales growth at some point this year, it is possible that Buffett’s patience with Apple will run out.

Las acciones de Apple saltaron hasta 6% tras reportar sus resultados del primer trimestre. A medida que pasan las horas, ha recortado su avance, pero sigue impulsando al Nasdaq y al S&P500, junto a acciones tecnológicas en Asia. La empresa reportó una caída en la venta de sus iPhones y una desaceleración de su negocio en China. Sin embargo Apple, las cifras fueron menos dramáticas a las que esperaba el mercado. No sólo eso, Apple se mostró optimista para su negocio para lo que queda del año. El factor detrás del alza de los papeles, sin embargo, es el anuncio de un plan de recompra de acciones por US$ 110.000 millones y un dividendo de 4%.  El impulso de Apple se extiende a otras acciones tecnológicas en Asia y Europa. En Asia, el Hang Seng extiende su rally con un alza por 1,48%. En Europa, los bancos francceses también capturan titulares. Société Générale y Crédit Agricole ven subir sus acciones 3% y 4%, respectivamente, tras reportar cifras por encima de lo esperado para el primer trimestre gracias al buen desempeño de sus bancas de inversión. La sesión en general mantiene un sesgo al alza, mientras los inversionistas esperan nuevos datos de EEUU. Se espera que el reporte laboral de abril muestre una moderación en contrataciones no agrícolas, con una creación de 243.000 empleos tras los sorpresivos 303.000 registrados en marzo. Muy importante, analistas también querrán ver una desaceleración en el ingreso medio por hora. Una expansión del índice PMI de servicios, que también se publica hoy, podría fortalecer la idea de una economía estadounidense que no permite espacios para un recorte de tasas de parte de la Fed. Hay que poner atención a lo que parece perfilarse como una batalla por Anglo American. Las acciones de la mineras suben 3,16%, tras reportes de que Glencore estaría estudiando presentar una oferta. Mientras, todavía se espera que BHP defina si mejorará su oferta para quedarse con los activos, principalmente de cobre, de Anglo.

    "content": "It's getting easier to track down a Blizzard in Beijing. Dairy Queen opened 450 new locations around the world last year — and 300 of them were in China. \"China continues to be our fastest-growing market,\" said Troy Bader, CEO of Bloomington-based International Dairy Queen. \"International plays a really, really important part of our future.\" Dairy Queen restaurants reported $6.4 billion in sales last year. Since 2019, sales are up 36%, Bader said, and global growth played a big role in that. More than a third of Dairy Queen's nearly 7,500 locations are now located outside the U.S. and Canada. \"Our international growth is where we're seeing our greatest opportunities — our presence isn't as mature,\" Bader said. China is a huge market for American fast-food chains, where KFC and McDonald's are the dominant players. However, local brands are starting to catch up. \"Initially considered a luxury item for a select few, fast food has become increasingly accessible and affordable for a broader segment of Chinese consumers as the economy has grown and disposable incomes have risen,\" according to a report by Dezan Shira & Associates, a foreign direct investment consultancy, which pegs the Chinese fast-food market at more than $500 billion. Dairy Queen is focusing on Southeast Asia broadly; the brand already has about 500 locations in Thailand and a presence in other nearby countries like Vietnam and the Philippines. \"We have supply chains established, we have brand recognition,\" Bader said. \"We are looking at new markets, but that is one area we continue to focus on.\" Mexico has also taken to soft serve, where there are nearly 325 Dairy Queen locations. The chain operates in 20 countries. Internationally, Dairy Queen is known more for its ice cream treats than its food, though the emphasis is shifting toward the Grill & Chill model more common in the U.S. \"We are still the undisputed treat leader and plan to be,\" Bader said. \"But we also are a very balanced food and treat player.\" Domestically, Dairy Queen is pushing even harder to be known for its hot eats as well as its cool treats. \"We talk about our chicken strips being Blizzard-good,\" Bader said, and a new burger lineup released in 2022 is still performing well. International Dairy Queen had $248 million in revenue last year and a $93 million profit, according to franchise disclosure documents, both improvements from the year before. The company earns royalties paid by franchisees and boasts a roughly 50% operating margin. Like other restaurants, Dairy Queen franchisees have had to increase prices in recent years to deal with higher wages and ingredient costs. Bader said the specific increases are up to individual store owners, though the company provides guidance, especially for maintaining the $7 meal and two-for-$5 promotions. \"We still want to make sure we have everyday value available for our fans,\" Bader said. Dairy Queen, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, will be serving up Dilly Bars at the multinational conglomerate's famed annual meeting this weekend in Omaha. Though a small part of Warren Buffett's business empire since 1998, the 84-year-old ice cream company is well-loved by shareholders, Bader said. \"Dairy Queen is one of their favorites because it has a special place in many people's lives and their hearts.\"  Brooks Johnson is a business reporter covering Minnesota’s food industry, 3M and manufacturing trends. © 2024 StarTribune.

    "description": "Mercedes macht es, Siemens, Apple und Berkshire Hathaway auch: Aktienrückkäufe nehmen zu. Welche Ziele die Unternehmen dabei verfolgen - und was die Folgen für Anleger sind. Von Antje Erhard.",
    "published_at": "2024-05-03T09:47:47Z",
    "content": "Stand: 03.05.2024 13:08 Uhr \nMercedes macht es, Siemens, Apple und Berkshire Hathaway auch: Aktienrückkäufe nehmen zu. Welche Ziele die Unternehmen dabei verfolgen - und was die Folgen für Anleger sind.\n \nImmer mehr Unternehmer nehmen Geld in die Hand, um ihre eigenen Aktien aufzukaufen. Das nennt man an der Börse Aktienrückkauf. Unternehmen haben dafür verschiedene Möglichkeiten: Zum einen der Weg über die Börsen. Wie jeder Marktteilnehmer können Unternehmen dort Aktien kaufen oder verkaufen, auch ihre eigenen. Zum anderen können sie ihren Aktionären ein öffentliches Angebot zum Kauf unterbreiten mit fester Anzahl und festem Preis. \nDie Hauptversammlung muss dem Vorstand dazu das \"Go\" geben. Dazu werden Umfang und Zeitraum des Rückkaufes genau festgelegt. Gesetzlich geregelt ist von vornherein, dass Unternehmen nur maximal zehn Prozent des Grundkapitals zurückerwerben dürfen. \nDie zurückgekauften Aktien kann ein Unternehmen aus dem Verkehr ziehen, also löschen. Eine andere Möglichkeit ist, sie an die Belegschaft auszugeben als eine Art Bonus. Manche Unternehmen nutzen das durchaus zur Motivation. \nAber warum kaufen Unternehmen ihre eigenen Aktien - ein Aktienrückkauf kostet schließlich Geld? Geld, das für Investitionen oder Schuldentilgung dann nicht mehr zur Verfügung steht? \nEs geschehe dann, \"wenn Unternehmen mehr Chancen darin sehen, ins eigene Unternehmen zu investieren, statt weiter in das operative Geschäft oder am Kapitalmarkt anzulegen\", sagt Börsenexperte Andreas Lipkow. Das sei eine gut abzuwägende unternehmerische Entscheidung. \"Und natürlich gibt man den Aktionären mehr Wert.\" \nKurz gesagt: Diese Programme hübschen den Kurs auf - auf legale Art: Wenn eine größere Anzahl Aktien vom Markt verschwindet und die Zahl der handelbaren Aktien sinkt, dann wird das Angebot knapper. Gewinne und Dividenden verteilen sich dann auf weniger Aktien. Das Ergebnis: Der Gewinn pro Aktie steigt, obwohl das Unternehmen nicht mehr verdient haben muss. Der Aktienkurs legt meistens zu. \n08.08.2022\n Konzerne werden in diesem Jahr möglicherweise so viele eigene Aktien erwerben wie noch nie.\n                                    mehr\n \nAktien-Rückkäufe können aber ein Unternehmen auch vor einer Übernahme schützen. Will ein Unternehmen nicht übernommen werden, kann es mit Aktien-Rückkäufen gegenhalten. Dann wird es für den kaufwilligen Konkurrenten schwerer, denn weniger Aktien bedeuten: höhere Preise. \nVor allem die Kurssteigerungen machen sich immer mehr Unternehmen auch hierzulande zunutze: Siemens, SAP und Mercedes sind die größten Rückkäufer. In Deutschland wollen die DAX-Unternehmen in diesem Jahr insgesamt rund 16 Milliarden Euro in Rückkäufe ihrer Aktien stecken, analysierte die Commerzbank kürzlich. Das wäre ein Rekordwert. \nAktionäre profitieren davon kurz- wie langfristig. Schon die Ankündigung eines solchen Programms lässt meistens den Aktienkurs zulegen. Langfristig belegt eine Auswertung des Vermögensverwalters HQ Trust, dass Aktien-Rückkäufe für die Aktionäre ein Vorteil sein können. \n15.04.2024\n Die Gewinne der im Leitindex DAX gelisteten Konzerne sinken, aber die Dividenden steigen auf ein Rekordhoch.\n                                    mehr\n \nDazu analysierte HQ Trust die Entwicklung des weltweit investierenden MSCI All Country World-Index über zehn Jahre: Im Durchschnitt stiegen die nordamerikanischen Aktien im Index in dem Zeitraum jährlich um 13,7 Prozent. 3,5 Prozentpunkte gehen nach Einschätzung von HQ Trust auf das Konto der Rückkäufe - in Europa sogar noch mehr: Obwohl die Kurse im Schnitt 6,8 Prozent jährlich gestiegen waren, haben die Rückkäufe in Europa 26,8 Prozent ausgemacht. \nIn den USA sind Rückkäufe seit Jahren gängige Praxis. Beispiel Apple: Der iPhone-Hersteller kündigte in dieser Woche an, Aktien für 110 Milliarden US-Dollar zu kaufen. Zum Vergleich: Im vergangenen Jahr hatte er für 78 Milliarden US-Dollar eigene Anteile vom Markt genommen, 2022 im Volumen von 90 Milliarden - und das in Zeiten, in denen die iPhone-Nachfrage sinkt und der wichtige chinesische Markt schwieriger geworden ist. Auch Groß-Investor Warren Buffett steckt immer wieder Milliarden in eigene Aktien. \n17.02.2021\n Warren Buffett hat in großem Stil Anteile an Telekomfirmen und dem Ölkonzern Chevron gekauft.\n                                    mehr\n \nNicht nur wenn es geschäftlich schwieriger läuft - grundsätzlich gibt es an Aktien-Rückkäufen Kritik: Einfallslos sei es, eigene Aktien zurückzukaufen; nur den Aktionären verpflichtet. Investitionen in das Geschäft wären sinnvoller. In schwierigen Zeiten halte man besser sein Geld zusammen. \nWährend in Deutschland die Rückkauf-Mentalität in den letzten Jahren zunimmt, rudern die USA aktuell etwas zurück. Im vergangenen Jahr haben US-Unternehmen für rund 773 Milliarden Dollar eigene Aktien gekauft. Allerdings waren das 17 Prozent weniger als im Vorjahr, das ergab eine Studie des Vermögensverwalters Janus Henderson. \n\nhintergrund\n\n12.04.2024\n Der \"Weltindex\" MSCI World ist bei vielen Fondssparern auch in Deutschland beliebt. Doch wie riskant ist er?\n                                    mehr\n \nDie Investmentbank Goldman Sachs prognostiziert allerdings für das kommende Jahr, dass die Rückkäufe einen Rekord erreichen, weil vor allem die Technologie-Unternehmen sich an den Programmen beteiligen: \"Das Gewinnwachstum ist der wichtigste Antrieb für Aktienrückkäufe\", erklärte Goldman Sachs im März in einer Studie und untermauerte das mit Zahlen: Erstmals soll die Billionen-Dollar-Grenze für Aktienrückkäufe der Unternehmen des S&P 500 Aktienindex fallen. \nNeben den Aussichten auf steigende Gewinne könnten die möglicherweise sinkenden Zinsen Unternehmen animieren, mehr Geld für Rückkäufe auszugeben.

    "content": "Adolfo Reséndiz   Periodista por la Escuela de Periodismo Carlos Septién García. Técnico mecánico automotriz CEDVA. Me gusta el rap, comer asado argentino y los fines de semana largos. Tesla ha vuelto a tomar el centro del escenario en el mundo de los autos eléctricos, recuperando su posición como líder mundial en ventas después de superar a su competidor chino BYD en el primer trimestre de 2024. Con 386,810 vehículos eléctricos vendidos en los primeros tres meses del año, Tesla ha logrado un hito significativo a pesar de una disminución del 20.2% respecto al último trimestre de 2023 y del 8.5% en comparación con el mismo trimestre del año pasado. BYD, por su parte, reportó ventas de 300,114 vehículos eléctricos en el mismo período, un aumento del 13.4% respecto al año anterior, pero muy por debajo de su récord de 526,409 unidades en el último trimestre de 2023. La compañía, respaldada por Berkshire Hathaway del veterano inversor estadounidense Warren Buffett, ha optado por reducir los precios de algunos de sus últimos modelos en un intento por atraer compradores más cautelosos frente a artículos costosos como los automóviles. Además, para contrarrestar la disminución de la demanda en China, BYD ha estado explorando nuevas oportunidades de expansión en otros mercados según informa la BBC. La caída en las ventas tanto de Tesla como de BYD se atribuye a una competencia creciente y a una demanda más débil en todo el mundo, especialmente en China. A esto se suma la eliminación de las ayudas públicas a la compra de vehículos eléctricos en Alemania o Noruega y la preferencia de los consumidores por los modelos híbridos. A pesar de estos desafíos, Elon Musk, CEO de Tesla, se mantiene optimista sobre el futuro de la compañía, destacando el potencial de crecimiento en el mercado de vehículos eléctricos y anunciando planes para acelerar el lanzamiento de nuevos modelos, incluido un vehículo más asequible y un robotaxi. La reciente visita de Musk a China y la eliminación de las restricciones a los autos de Tesla para cumplir con los requisitos de seguridad de datos del país son señales alentadoras para la compañía, que espera expandir su presencia en el mercado automotriz más grande del mundo. Aunque Tesla enfrenta desafíos por delante, como la competencia feroz y la necesidad de mantener la innovación, su capacidad para recuperar el trono mundial de los autos eléctricos demuestra su resiliencia y su posición como líder en la industria automotriz del futuro.

    "content": "Everyone knows Warren Buffett ‘s successor won’t be able to match the legendary investor, but Berkshire Hathaway ‘s board remains confident Greg Abel is the right guy to one day lead the conglomerate into the future. Longtime Berkshire board member Ron Olson told investors gathered Thursday at a conference two days ahead of the company’s annual shareholders meeting that Abel understands all the fundamental principles that guided Buffett, like letting Berkshire’s companies largely run themselves. And Abel will be committed to running Berkshire in a conservative way that will protect the company that’s known for it financial strength, he said. “Greg is not somebody who is going to be as likely to create the kind of following in the press that I think Warren has had,” Olson said. “On the other hand. I have every reason to believe that he will run the companies that we have the responsibility for in the same way that Warren ran them.” Olson said he’s confident business owners will still be willing to sell their companies to Berkshire once the Canadian utility executive takes over after the 93-year-old Buffett is gone. Olson said he doesn’t think last year’s public legal fight with the billionaire Haslam family over how much Berkshire would ultimately pay for the last 20% of the Pilot truck stop chain the family agreed to sell to Buffett will be a deterrent to future deals either. Both the Haslams and Berkshire accused each other of trying to manipulate Pilot’s earnings to affect the final $2.6 billion price. Business owners considering selling can see all the positive and respectful relationships Berkshire has with its dozens of other subsidiaries on display in the 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall adjoining the arena where Saturday’s meeting will be held, Olson said. In fact the legal battle gave Olson, who is a partner at Berkshire’s primary law firm, the chance to work closely with Abel, giving him even more confidence in the board’s chosen successor. “I could tell you that his preparation and thinking was impressive. He is strategic in his thinking. And he is decisive in his judgement,” Olson said. Plus, Berkshire is sitting on more than $167 billion cash, so it has ample resources to do deals and, Olson said, “people generally like to be paid in cash.” Abel, who keeps a low profile and doesn’t typically grant interviews, will be answering questions alongside Buffett for hours Saturday, trying to help fill the role Buffett’s longtime partner Charlie Munger held for decades before he died last fall. Abel has been overseeing all of Berkshire’s varied non-insurance businesses for several years while another vice chairman, Ajit Jain, oversees the insurance businesses, including Geico and General Reinsurance. Olson said Abel is a numbers guy who can dissect a business’ balance sheet as quickly and well as Buffett, and he’s also a great listener that people like to work with. But, Olson said, “Greg is not going to be as entertaining as Warren and Charlie have been through the years.” So Munger’s absence will be felt acutely on Saturday by all the thousands of people attending the meeting. There simply is no way to replace the expertise, advice and friendship Munger offered to Buffett for more than six decades. Professor Lawrence Cunningham, who has written several books about Berkshire, said he thinks even with the profound loss of Munger the company he helped build will endure. “The chair is empty. There’s no way to fill it. But I’m also confident that Warren — and especially Greg and Ajit — will carry on the torch,” Cunningham said. Berkshire has been grappling with succession questions for decades, but Cunningham said he thinks Buffett and Munger built an organization bigger than themselves that will endure. Olson said Berkshire’s board knows there just isn’t another Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger out there to replace those two men. After Buffett dies, Berkshire will face pressure as the shareholder base evolves to include more index and activist investors. One of the things investors may demand is that Berkshire change its longstanding policy and start paying a dividend if it can’t find a good use for all that cash. Olson said the board hasn’t ruled out paying a dividend at some point in the future, but it also hasn’t seriously considering approving one now with Buffett still at the helm. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

''Greg is not somebody who is going to be as likely to create the kind of following in the press that I think Warren has had,'' Olson said. ''On the other hand. I have every reason to believe that he will run the companies that we have the responsibility for in the same way that Warren ran them.'' Olson said he's confident business owners will still be willing to sell their companies to Berkshire once the Canadian utility executive takes over after the 93-year-old Buffett is gone. Olson said he doesn't think last year's public legal fight with the billionaire Haslam family over how much Berkshire would ultimately pay for the last 20% of the Pilot truck stop chain the family agreed to sell to Buffett will be a deterrent to future deals either. Both the Haslams and Berkshire accused each other of trying to manipulate Pilot's earnings to affect the final $2.6 billion price. Business owners considering selling can see all the positive and respectful relationships Berkshire has with its dozens of other subsidiaries on display in the 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall adjoining the arena where Saturday's meeting will be held, Olson said. In fact the legal battle gave Olson, who is a partner at Berkshire's primary law firm, the chance to work closely with Abel, giving him even more confidence in the board's chosen successor. ''I could tell you that his preparation and thinking was impressive. He is strategic in his thinking. And he is decisive in his judgement,'' Olson said. Plus, Berkshire is sitting on more than $167 billion cash, so it has ample resources to do deals and, Olson said, ''people generally like to be paid in cash.'' Abel, who keeps a low profile and doesn't typically grant interviews, will be answering questions alongside Buffett for hours Saturday, trying to help fill the role Buffett's longtime partner Charlie Munger held for decades before he died last fall. Abel has been overseeing all of Berkshire's varied non-insurance businesses for several years while another vice chairman, Ajit Jain, oversees the insurance businesses, including Geico and General Reinsurance. Olson said Abel is a numbers guy who can dissect a business' balance sheet as quickly and well as Buffett, and he's also a great listener that people like to work with. But, Olson said, ''Greg is not going to be as entertaining as Warren and Charlie have been through the years.'' So Munger's absence will be felt acutely on Saturday by all the thousands of people attending the meeting. There simply is no way to replace the expertise, advice and friendship Munger offered to Buffett for more than six decades. Professor Lawrence Cunningham, who has written several books about Berkshire, said he thinks even with the profound loss of Munger the company he helped build will endure. ''The chair is empty. There's no way to fill it. But I'm also confident that Warren — and especially Greg and Ajit — will carry on the torch,'' Cunningham said. Berkshire has been grappling with succession questions for decades, but Cunningham said he thinks Buffett and Munger built an organization bigger than themselves that will endure. Olson said Berkshire's board knows there just isn't another Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger out there to replace those two men. After Buffett dies, Berkshire will face pressure as the shareholder base evolves to include more index and activist investors. One of the things investors may demand is that Berkshire change its longstanding policy and start paying a dividend if it can't find a good use for all that cash. Olson said the board hasn't ruled out paying a dividend at some point in the future, but it also hasn't seriously considering approving one now with Buffett still at the helm. © 2024 StarTribune.

(AP) — Everyone knows Warren Buffett 's successor won't be able to match the legendary investor, but Berkshire Hathaway 's board remains confident Greg Abel is the right guy to one day lead the conglomerate into the future.
